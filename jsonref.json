It must have been in 1979 or 1980, while I was a member of the board of the English National Opera. The Prime Minister had not been very long in office when we invited her and her husband to a performance of Tosca.When it was over there was a little reception, in the course of which I went up to her and said I hoped she had enjoyed it. ‘Oh yes,’ she said, and then, to my astonishment, lectured to me about Tosca for several minutes: where it belonged in Puccini’s works, who had been the greatest singers of note, and much else besides.         Mr Norwich invited Margaret Thatcher to a performance of Tosca around 1979 when he was a member of the board of the English National Opera. After the performance, she critiqued the colour of one of the singer\u0027s kerchiefI realised that, typically, she had sent for a brief, and learnt it. (She could never bear to be seen at a disadvantage.) The lecture finished and with me still there, she had to find another superiority: clothes.PM: Of course, if one had been producing it oneself, one would have made certain changes.JJN: Oh really, Prime Minister, what changes for example?PM: Well, I mean, Tosca’s fichu.JJN: But, Prime Minister, what was wrong with Tosca’s fichu?PM: The colour, of course.JJN: Well, it was red.PM: Yes, it was red!JJN: But, Prime Minister, what colour should Tosca’s fichu have been?PM: Cerise.  From an obituary notice in the Daily Telegraph, December 19, 2001:Melvin Burkhart, who has died aged 94, was a fairground sideshow performer known as the Human Blockhead because of his ability to drive a five-inch nail or an icepick into his head without flinching. The Human Blockhead worked under a number of alternative titles, depending on which of his extraordinary repertoire of physical contortions he happened to be performing.         Melvin Burkhart became known as the Human Blockhead because of his ability to drive a five-inch nail or ice pick into his head without flinching. He worked under many titles given his skill contorting parts of his bodyAs the Anatomical Wonder, he could inflate one lung at a time and dislocate his shoulders as the Man Without A Stomach, he could suck his stomach back to his spine as the Two-Faced Man, he could frown with half his face and smile with the other half. Among many other accomplishments, he swallowed swords, threw knives and ate fire.He was universally admired by his fellow performers, one of whom observed: ‘Anyone who has ever hammered a five-inch nail into his nose owes a large debt to Melvin Burkhart.’  General Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord (1878–1943) was Chief of the German High Command. He supervised the manual on the Military Unit Command (Truppenführung), which was published in October 1933. Here is an extract:‘I ide my officers into four classes the clever, the lazy, the industrious and the stupid. Each officer possesses at least two of these qualities. Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can be made in certain circumstances of those who are stupid and lazy.         Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord (pictured right, with Kurt Gebhard Adolf Philipp in 1934) ided his officers into four classes of clever, lazy, the industrious and the stupid. He said the man \u0027who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest command\u0027‘The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest command. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity to deal with all situations. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous.’  My friend Brian Young told me some years ago that a sentence with a surprise ending is called a paraprosdokian. Examples are:Dorothy Parker’s:If all the girls who attended the Yale prom were laid end to end, I wouldn’t be a bit surprised.Or Groucho Marx’s:I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn’t it.Or Ogden Nash’s:If at first you don’t succeed, the hell with it.Or Alice Roosevelt Longworth’s:If you can’t think of anything nice and kind to say about anyone — why, do come and sit beside me.  Taken from THE ULTIMATE CHRISTMAS CRACKER by John Julius Norwich, published by John Murray at £14.99. © John Julius Norwich 2019.

A petition signed by almost 60,000 people is calling on the Nobel committee to revoke the award from the “apologist for the ‘butcher of Balkans’ Slobodan Milošević”. Handke spoke at Milošević’s funeral in 2006, calling him “a rather tragic man”.The petition is due to be delivered by protesters on 10 December in Stockholm, when Handke is scheduled to receive his SEK9m (£743,000) prize.After an awkward moment during which the room was induced to sing Happy Birthday to the author, Handke was asked at the press conference about the polarised response to his win. He responded: “This is a very long story. To tell this story here, I think it’s not the moment.”Asked about the planned protests next week, Handke reminisced about a visit to Norway in 2014, when he won the Ibsen award. “There were a lot of protests when I went to the National Theatre of Oslo. A lot of shouting of ‘fascist, fascist’. I wanted to talk to these ladies and gentlemen but they didn’t want to talk to me,” he said. In his speech accepting that prize, he told his critics: “Go to hell, where you already are.” Handke was asked by Peter Maass, a journalist at the Intercept, if he would say that the Srebrenica massacre, where almost 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, had happened. Handke responded by talking about a letter he had been sent by an anonymous critic which he said was sent with a piece of toilet paper, “which had a calligraphy of shit”. After finishing, he told Maass: “I prefer toilet paper, an anonymous letter with toilet paper inside, to your empty and ignorant questions.”Handke’s lack of straight answers is unlikely to put the controversy to rest, with the Nobel Foundation and the Swedish Academy also under fire over their choice. Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel committee, has told critics that “the ambition is to celebrate his extraordinary literary work, not the person. But earlier this week, two members of the external committee set up to oversee reforms in the controversy-prone Swedish Academy resigned, with one, journalist Gun-Britt Sundström, blaming her departure on Handke’s victory.“The choice of 2019 laureate was not just a choice about a body of work, it has also been interpreted, both inside the academy and outside, as a defence of the stance that literature is above ‘politics’,” she told Dagens Nyheter. “That is not my ideology.”Earlier on Friday, Peter Englund, the former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said he would not attend the ceremonies because to celebrated Handke’s win “would be gross hypocrisy on my part”.Jonas Eklöf, editor in chief of Swedish books magazine Vi Läser, was at the press conference. He said that the feeling among Swedish journalists covering the Nobel “has been fatigue, exhaustion and ... ‘Not again!’ A feeling that little has to do with literature right now.”“There is still a lot of turbulence within the academy, with new boycotts and two out of five members leaving the Nobel committee in only the last week,” said Eklöf. “About today, what can I say: it was strange – especially the birthday song to Handke – and a little bit awkward, but not as uncomfortable as one might have expected. Feeling right now: just want to go home and have a glass of wine and read Flights.”Flights is a novel by the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk, winner of the 2018 Nobel prize for literature. Her win was announced on the same day as Handke’s, due to the postponement of last year’s prize. She is using her winnings to fund a foundation to support the work of writers and translators which will help “describe the reality in which xenophobic and nationalist sentiments are growing dangerously quickly”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da193b2b9e584fa637c2faba9e8c6bc15472f56a/0_41_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646ede73024264d55cc900aa580916f4","title":"difficult truth labour social conservatives","story":"A recurring theme of this election has been the battle for Labour’s leave-voting constituencies, the so-called “red wall” of seats running from north Wales to the Humber estuary – the seats that Boris Johnson’s “Get Brexit done” slogan is designed to win over. But despite being billed as the “Brexit” election, many of the key moments of the campaign have come back to economics: taxation, nationalisation, pensions and of course the NHS. This has clearly been a strategy by the Labour party to try to hold together its coalition of 2017 voters, who are broadly united on the economic aims of the party.The problem is not that there are too few “leftwing” voters in the electorate. The British Election Study (BES) measures these political positions using a series of attitudinal statements that include “There is one law for the rich and one for the poor” and “Ordinary people get their fair share of the nation’s wealth”. Since these questions were first asked at the 1992 election, the British public have been on average slightly “leftwing”. If people voted only on their economic values, we should have had a Labour government for the last two decades. In light of its absence, it clearly isn’t just “the economy, stupid”.The problem for Labour is two-fold. Voters do not cast their votes based on economic issues alone, and, more critically, voters on the left are ided on non-economic issues such as justice and immigration. The BES data measures responses to statements such as “People who break the law should be given stiffer sentences” and “Young people don’t have enough respect for traditional values”. People’s positions on this social dimension are statistically unrelated to their positions on the economic issues, or in the language of political science, these two sets of values cross-cut, rather than reinforce each other.This ide runs deeper than Brexit position alone, which explains why appearing more leave-leaning in leave-voting areas is insufficient for Labour to win back lost voters. Attitudes to migrants highlight the isions that run through the potential Labour vote on the left. Asked whether they agreed that “Immigrants increase crime rates in Britain”, one in 10 of those on the economic left with socially liberal values agreed with the statement, while among those on the economic left with socially conservative values this was a little more than half. Meanwhile, more than half of the socially conservative group also agreed that “The will of the majority should always prevail, even over the rights of minorities”.There has been considerable talk of the “politically homeless” over the last two years, and several new parties have formed in an attempt to offer them shelter. Britain’s lost voters are often assumed to be mostly centrist on economics but socially liberal and pro-remain. The performance of parties aimed at winning over these voters perhaps suggests this diagnosis was wrong.Instead, there seems to be a potential cohort of voters who are economically left-leaning, socially conservative, voted leave and have become increasingly detached from both the Labour party and politics more generally. In 2017, there is evidence to suggest that these voters were more likely to stay at home than before. In 2019, some of these voters may move across to the Conservative party some will vote for the Brexit party, where they have that option others may stay at home again. But the Labour party needs to hold on to those more socially conservative voters who were willing to stick with the party in 2017 the difficulty is that their economic messages fail to cut through to voters who believe that the party is no longer listening to people like them.• Paula Surridge is a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol’s school of sociology, politics and international studies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/359285ca1a777e3079dff21396b9af5bfdb2f303/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c23a352d091a19855ed53008ed04fe53","title":"labour divided family together brexitland remainia","story":"Whatever happens next Thursday, an act of reconciliation will be necessary. Not between the winning and losing parties, but within one of them – bridging a ide that separates their supporters, both former and current, from each other. This gulf is not so much ideological as it is cultural or even tribal. The ide I have in mind is among the millions of people who either used to, or still do, identify themselves with Labour.It’s been discussed often, but it’s rare to see it in a single room. That’s what I witnessed this week in the marginal seat of Dagenham and Rainham, where east London blurs into Essex. For the second time in a matter of days, I was eavesdropping on a focus group of voters, this time brought together especially for the  by Ipsos Mori. In fact it was two groups, the first made up of leavers, the next remainers, sitting around talking politics with a facilitator in sessions of 90 minutes each.That picture doesn’t just reflect the mixed and changing face of this one constituency, held in the last parliament by Labour’s Jon Cruddas. It reflects what used to be Labour’s wider electoral coalition, a mix rendered unstable by Brexit.As it happens, there was not that much talk of Brexit itself: when leavers or remainers are only with each other, few feel the need to relitigate the familiar arguments. Instead, they talked about what ailed their area, what they wanted to see changed, how they saw the political parties and their promises. And on this, they were poles apart. The first group – older, whiter, more working-class – liked Boris Johnson, or were at least ready to indulge him. They couldn’t stand Jeremy Corbyn, finding him weak, indecisive and old-fashioned. (If he was a TV programme, “he’d be Dad’s Army”. Where would he go on holiday? “Bournemouth, by coach.”) By contrast, the second group – younger, more erse, often with a degree – were full of praise for the Labour leader, seeing him as “a man of principle”, while Johnson was “a racist”. The former were sceptical of Labour’s manifesto promises, worried there was no “magic money tree” and they were going to end up footing the bill via their taxes. The latter liked the free broadband and free tuition fees.Most revealing was the difference in attitude to two new railway stations serving the area. Dave, a former trade unionist with memories of the old Ford plant in Dagenham, had joked that the area’s biggest problem was an “influx of Europeans”. He worried that the area was becoming too crowded, and new stations would only make it busier still. Meanwhile, David, a team leader in a communications company, was glad they were coming: they’d bring money and jobs into the area by making London closer. In the same constituency, in the same room, you could glimpse the faultline that ides what some still like to call the Labour family. It’s the same gap that separates Grimsby or Oldham Labour from London or Manchester Labour. Crudely put, there’s the Labour of the big cities, graduates who see mobility, ersity and change as an opportunity, and there’s the Labour of the smaller towns, where those same shifts can look like a threat.Of course, that ide not did appear for the first time on 23 June 2016: the writer David Marquand was worrying about “the progressive dilemma” three decades ago. But Brexit has widened it and dramatised it, not least because it’s pushed people to break a habit that had been passed down the generations – and change their vote. That leaves a question, what Cruddas calls “the outstanding question of reconciliation”, one facing social democratic parties across the world. How can Labour bring together two tribes that now seem to inhabit different worlds?Some have argued that, despite its name, Labour should all but write off its old, white working-class base in the once industrial towns and organise itself instead around younger, socially liberal graduates in the major cities. Leave the left-behind leavers behind, and unabashedly become the party of climate-conscious, urban remainers: after all, the first lot are dying off, the second are the future.That’s a crude summary, I know, but you get the gist. Yet that approach grates on every progressive instinct, that a party of the left should be the party of working people, not just modernity’s “winners”. It fails a more basic test too: social democrats can’t win power without working people’s votes.But if the task of binding those two groups into a single party has always been a challenge, what Cruddas calls “the Brexit trauma” has made it infinitely worse. Was there anything Labour could have done to keep both leavers and remainers on board after the referendum? I’ve spoken to MPs in leave seats who believe there was. It would have meant Labour crafting a compromise position – in effect, a soft Brexit – and advocating it consistently and clearly. Both leavers and remainers would have had to give up something, but with persuasion maybe both could have been won round. The current stance, of neutrality in a second referendum, does not quite cut it, says one MP, because the outcome will see one camp winning and the other losing, rather than both sides meeting halfway. For myself, I cling to the view that Labour could have stuck to a remain stance and still retained the support of leavers. But it would have required something like a rerun of Tony Blair’s 2005 “masochism strategy”, when he put himself in front of hostile audiences who lacerated him for the Iraq war, absorbing all their invective, gaining grudging credit for facing his critics and sticking to his convictions. If Corbyn had done that in leave-voting seats, straight after the referendum, maybe some of those Labour leavers would not be preparing to abandon the party now.What both approaches would have required is strong leadership and a compelling plan to rejuvenate the towns, a sign that Labour had deeply understood the anxieties that fuelled that 2016 vote. Free tuition fees and discounted rail fares do not quite send that message, no matter how appealing they might be to young or metropolitan voters.And yet, those MPs who, in their own seats, have to walk this high wire, winning over the two camps, are not wholly despondent. Across both Dagenham groups there was agreement on the NHS and on the need for investment in public services and the economy. Surprisingly, perhaps, there was some convergence on crime too. It was not the leavers who demanded that those guilty of knife crime serve full, harsh sentences, but two young black men in the remain group. That points to a possible bridge that might join Labour’s two tribes.Talk to Lisa Nandy, seeking re-election in Wigan, and she recalls the slogan which, more than any other, once brought Labour’s two wings together: “Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.” That, says Nandy, “spoke to both the middle class and those who were working class to the core. It reassured both of them.”The bitter end of the New Labour project has obscured how it began and what made it successful enough to win three big majorities in a row. But its earliest lessons may need to be learned all over again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10becaf99c296af627d2898fa459fde8bae3a0cc/0_116_5099_3059/master/5099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7fd255760c6b4b246cb55130056b860","title":"the guardian view on schools for the future no thanks to more of the same","story":"School cuts proved to be an achilles heel for Theresa May in the 2017 election, and Boris Johnson learned from her mistake. In September, the Conservatives announced a £4.4 billion per year increase in funding for English schools (education is a devolved issue) that was calculated to neutralise Labour attacks. Polling suggests that education has declined in importance for voters over the past two years. Schools do not have the totemic significance for the current party leaders that they did for Tony Blair and David Cameron. But September’s announcement should not have allowed the Conservatives to escape censure to the extent that they have.The former education secretary, Damian Hinds, presented solid proposals to improve recruitment and retention of teachers. His successor, Gavin Williamson, threatens to undo such work, with proposals to ratchet up the stress still further by boosting Ofsted’s powers, employing the inflammatory language of “reasonable force” when discussing discipline, and ignoring concerns about the narrowing of the curriculum.Voters should look past such cheap shots for the bigger picture. That is a system in which the attainment gap between more and less advantaged pupils has again begun growing, SEN provision is in crisis, and the murky phenomenon of off-rolling – whereby pupils leave before GCSEs without going through a formal exclusion process – continues to spread. Vocational training remains chronically neglected (the thoughtful report commissioned from Philip Augar by Theresa May having been discarded), while free schools and academies have failed to deliver promised improvements to the system as a whole. Lower-ability pupils are poorly served by the new GCSEs, with more than one-third failing to reach the required level 4 in maths and English. Overarching all this is startling evidence of a deeper malaise among young people, with an influential OECD survey this week revealing that barely half of UK 15-year-olds are satisfied with their lives.There are bright spots. The same survey found that pupils had improved their scores in reading and maths. Tests aside, schools across the country remain full of vitality as well as angst. Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos contain pledges that would lead to improvements. While the Lib Dems have made the more ambitious offer on early years, Labour has promised to replace Ofsted, provide free school breakfasts, and spend £7bn on school buildings that are in some cases falling apart. Both parties promise more teachers and reduced testing, while Labour’s 2017 pledge to abolish university tuition fees (and the huge debts they pile on young adults’ shoulders) remains in place.These commitments have been somewhat buried among other spending pledges. But they should not be overlooked, particularly when the disappointing Conservative offer amounts to more of the – very inadequate – same. Children deserve more than this from the next government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2b29a69afc4826da414b48da5521ace4664b8a/0_94_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f45748776cbb930cd78a175eab309ba","title":"tories victory stats tell different story labour youthquake","story":"Labour has made significant gains in the polls over the past few weeks – and, as in 2017, a ‘youthquake’ looks likelyIs history about to repeat itself? With less than a week to go until Britain’s third general election in five years, the Conservatives have failed to confront any of the shortcomings that led to them losing their majority in 2017. Their manifesto offered nothing new in terms of policy for young people or remain voters – two key groups who voted overwhelmingly against the Conservatives in 2017. Boris Johnson’s campaign has instead focused on winning the support of leave voters, attempting to avoid making any new promises and relentlessly criticising Jeremy Corbyn.At first glance, this strategy would appear to be working: in the fourth week of the election campaign, the Conservatives were 10 points ahead of Labour on average in the polls, and on a universal swing would have won a majority of 46 seats. But beneath the headline figures in the polls, the numbers tell a story that should leave the Conservatives deeply worried.In 2017, there were three main factors that scuppered the Conservatives’ hopes of winning an overall majority: a surge in support for the Labour party in the polls a massive increase in youth turnout and support for Labour among young people and remain voters swinging their support behind Labour as the most viable alternative to the Conservatives. All of these things are now happening again.In short, the idea that this election is a foregone conclusion is as incorrect as it was in 2017. Labour has made significant gains in the polls over the past few weeks, and the events of 2017 are largely being repeated. The Corbyn surge, the “youthquake”, the collapse in support for minor parties and the enthusiasm among Labour supporters – all these things occurred in 2017, and have occurred again. A slight error in the polls – such as the kind that occurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017 – could see Corbyn enter No 10.• Ell Smith is the founder of Stats for Lefties, a blog and podcast that examines polls and elections"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71feb3bb4c0ca18507e33b573feb0a0fea87985c/0_0_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68abd45222073b2f386bf5880d4ec533","title":"spotify wrapped users alarmed by their own listening habits","story":"Streaming service gave subscribers a look back at their entire decade of music consumptionSpotify’s annual Wrapped feature, which reveals users’ favourite music from the past year, has been released to its 243 million users, prompting mixed emotions among subscribers.The feature has become an anticipated event for regular users as it shows their most played songs, top artists, favourite genres and minutes listened for the year.

And if you want to buy produce, you’re in luck – Edmontonians love a farmers’ market, with no less than 16 held weekly during the summer.It’s not just the restaurants making the most of locally sourced ingredients craft beer and spirits are booming, as entrepreneurs also make use of Alberta’s natural larder. Head to the Park Distillery in Banff for the aptly named Glacier Rye whisky, made with glacier water from Banff National Park. The multi-award-winning Eau Claire – makers of Alberta’s first craft single malt whisky – uses ingredients harvested from farms in southern Alberta.Edmonton’s nickname as “festival city” is well-earned. No matter the season, there’s a festival in town. The Edmonton International Fringe Festival – the largest, longest running fringe festival in North America – is held each August. Watch the streets of Old Strathcona fill with performers, from circus acts to standup comedians. Calgary, too, is no slouch when it comes to getting into the party spirit – it even has its own Music Mile, a mile-long stretch of 9th Avenue SE bursting with music venues, including the Ironwood Stage and Studio Bell, home of the National Music Centre. But long before there was a city here in Alberta, bison roamed, and First Nations people lived off the land. Take in 6,000 years of plains culture at the evocatively and aptly named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump cliff. The Unesco world heritage site, 14 miles west of Fort Macleod, was an important hunting site for First Nations communities. Today a visitor centre houses prehistoric artefacts and offers tours of the site.A tri-area lift ticket gets you access to Mount Norquay, Lake Louise Ski Resort and Sunshine Village – revered by skiers and boarders worldwide as one of the top places in the world to seek out feather-light snow. For the more adventurous, Fortress Mountain, located on the Kananaskis Trail, 70 miles west of Calgary, offers skiers and riders of intermediate-plus level the chance to go in search of virgin snow. Head to Castle Mountain to go cat-skiing, where you’ll have access to untouched powder so dry and light it’s nicknamed “liquid smoke”.If you’re after a more tranquil experience, take to the water in summer. Rent a canoe or kayak in Banff National Park and explore the waterways of the Bow Valley, including 40 Mile Creek and Vermilion Lakes. Or ride the backcountry mountain trails on horseback, camping out in the wilderness with a riding holiday.Alberta’s ski-heaven winters and fine summers may draw the crowds, but make no mistake, one of the best times to visit is autumn. Take a hike up to Larch Valley in late September, starting at the unbelievably photogenic Moraine Lake , to see the trees turn a flaming yellow amid the wisps of the season’s first snow. The two-and-a-half-mile hike will take you from the spectacular turquoise waters backed by the ice-capped Valley of Ten Peaks, up to a high alpine meadow. Then there’s stargazing in Jasper, where you’ll find one of the world’s largest dark sky preserves. Every October, the Dark Sky Festival holds a number of events from symphonies under the stars to rocket building workshops.Of course, winter is magical in the Rockies. And that’s not just because of the skiing: stave off the January blues in Banff with the 11-day long Snow Days Festival, centred around massive snow sculptures in downtown Banff. Or head to Lake Louise for the Ice Magic Festival, as international ice-carving teams compete to create giant sculptures on the frozen lake.Discover more adventures throughout the year in Alberta with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

But as those waters have warmed, their numbers have fallen drastically.Tribal leaders in Sitka have long called for better protection of herring, a fish that holds cultural as well as economic significance for the people here. To demand protection of the sac roe herring fishery on which their way of life depends, they are taking the Alaskan government to court.For the subsistence harvesters of sac roe herring in the sound, this decline has been accelerated by what they see as the failure of the government to manage the herring fishery properly. Since 2002, the Sitka Tribe of Alaska (STA) has been appealing to the board of fisheries with proposals to protect the herring population.The scale of the decline was underlined in April, with the cancellation of an annual derby that usually sees hundreds of boats from the North Pacific gather in Sitka before setting sail for two to three days’ fishing. This year, not a single ship left the port and not a single herring was caught.The Sitka tribe, of more than 4,000 people, welcomed cancellation of the derby by Alaska’s department of food and game. But the move doesn’t reverse a decade of decline. While in 2009 the derby had celebrated a record fishing season, by 2018 the Sitka sac roe herring fishery was forced to close early because the herring were too scarce and too small.It was the fourth time in eight years that the herring fishery had shut down early without meeting the quota, following early closures in 2012, 2013 and 2016. In 2018 the department had expected a catch of more than 11,000 tonnes of sac roe herring, but not even 3,000 tonnes were produced, according to its own report.While the commercial industry harvests the eggs from inside the fish once caught, subsistence harvesters set out hemlock branches after the fleet leaves, where herring spawn and lay their eggs. Native Alaskans have been harvesting herring in this way for centuries but, in recent years, they have been pulling up branches bare. They say herring spawn now only cover a fraction of the coastline, and fear is mounting within the Sitka tribe that local stocks are on the verge of collapse.At the heart of the dispute with Alaska’s authorities is the question of whether the herring – which feeds on zooplankton and phytoplankton and is a key food for salmon, seabirds and marine mammals – is designated a forage fish. The STA wants the species to be included on a forage fish management plan, acknowledging its importance in the Alaskan food web.The Sitka tribe also want Alaskan authorities to decrease the size of the herring that can be taken to market in order to protect the species, but say their requests have fallen on deaf ears. Herring return to spawn for up to seven years, each year growing larger depending on conditions in the ocean. It takes a fish at least five years to reach the size and roe maturity that processors want.In 2018, the fisheries board turned down a proposal to reduce the level of the commercial catch, and last December STA launched legal action in the superior court to demand a new management plan for the fishery. The Sitka tribe also want the court to find the actions of the fisheries board department of food and game illegal.A spokesperson for the STA explained the action, saying: “The time is now to ensure that our people have the chance to fulfil their cultural responsibilities, which have been interwoven with the herring since time immemorial, and to fill their freezers. We cannot sit by while the state of Alaska shirks its statutory and constitutional duties to citizens. We demand action by the state.”The trial – the culmination of more than two decades of concern over declining herring for the Sitka tribe – has been set for January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5353971fc189510ce86896cb73cf7ab440cba923/0_71_3335_2002/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=089f0a048e348a496041f4c7970bddc5","title":"greta thunberg says school strikes have achieved nothing","story":"The global wave of school strikes for the climate over the past year has “achieved nothing” because greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, Greta Thunberg has told activists at UN climate talks in Madrid.Thousands of young people were expected to gather at the UN climate conference and in the streets of the Spanish capital on Friday to protest against the lack of progress in tackling the climate emergency, as officials from more than 190 countries wrangled over the niceties of wording in documents related to the Paris accord.Thunberg, whose solo protest in Sweden in 2017 has since snowballed into a global movement, spoke at a press conference before a march through the centre of Madrid. She said that although schoolchildren had been striking around the world, this “has not translated into action” from governments.“I’m just an activist and we need more activists,” she said. “Some people are afraid to change – they try so desperately to silence us.”Thunberg expressed hope for the UN negotiations but doubted whether governments had got the message, and warned the world could not afford continued inaction.“I sincerely hope COP25 will reach something concrete and increase awareness among people, and that world leaders and people in power grasp the urgency of the climate crisis, because right now it does not seem that they are,” she said.Although young people would keep striking, Thunberg said, they wanted to stop – if governments made credible promises and showed a willingness to act.“We can’t go on like this it is not sustainable that children skip school and we don’t want to continue – we would love some action from the people in power. People are suffering and dying today. We can’t wait any longer,” she said.The march was scheduled to coincide with protests and youth climate strikes around the world. In the US, Bernie Sanders and Jane Fonda were among the politicians and celebrities planning to join in.As well as the march and a sit-down protest in the conference centre, there were shows of international solidarity among young people from around the world, including a picnic in a central Madrid park. The conference centre was flooded with hundreds of schoolchildren accompanied by their parents, many with babies in prams, who were kept separate from the rooms where negotiators were working on a draft text to clarify aspects of the Paris agreement.Young people voiced their frustration at protests inside and outside the conference centre on the outskirts of Madrid.Brianna Fruean from Samoa, speaking for the Pacific Climate Warriors, told the conference: “World leaders need to know that people like me are watching them. The text we put down today on paper at COP is what our future will look like.”Many of the young people joining the conference from developing nations around the world bore personal witness to suffering they had experienced or seen.“I’ve had typhoid. I’ve had malaria. My grandmother died from cholera. I know what I’m talking about,” said Jimmy Fénelon, the national coordinator of the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network in Haiti. “We need to raise awareness among young people. We can get them to work together and send a strong message.”Renae Baptiste, also from CYEN, said: “For us, climate change is no longer a concept or theory, it’s our new reality. It’s affecting our lives now.”The activist Miguel van der Velden said: “These things are not games. They’re getting worse. They’re affecting millions of people around the world. I come here because I have hope that we can work together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a16d4203d852aef109dfc7c11d49cb8741e5ee/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=30ddcf3c1e15b5d13b935b4b0c27e5d2 1320w","title":"the best mens partywear for all ages in pictures","story":"It’s time to raise a glass and break out the partywear.

Marcus Rashford grinds to a halt. Old Trafford pauses with him. Rashford waits. There’s a wiggle of the toes. And then the explosion.Rashford’s second goal against Tottenham on Wednesday night was, in many ways, a distillation of everything he does best. As Serge Aurier closed him down on the left flank, Rashford paused for an instant, waiting for his opponent to commit. A twitch of the boot was enough to convince Aurier that Rashford was planning to cut inside. And in that moment, with a conjuror’s cunning, Rashford was away: knocking the ball through Aurier’s legs, sprinting past him, burning around the outside of Moussa Sissoko – himself an exceptionally quick player – and eventually drawing the foul from which he would convert United’s winning penalty.The pledge, the turn, the prestige. It was a goal of raw athleticism and outrageous smarts, of skill and patience and pure, facetious mastery. The penalty was Rashford’s second goal of the evening, having peppered Paulo Gazzaniga with shots all night, and as United moved back into the top six for the first time since September, the consensus appeared to be that Rashford, with 12 goals in his last 13 games for club and country, is on the verge of something. The question, as he prepares to step out at the Etihad Stadium for the 179th Manchester derby, is what.This will be Rashford’s eighth Manchester derby and he is yet to produce a display to match the impact of his first, in 2016, when he marked a 1-0 United win at the Etihad with the only goal of the game. Nevertheless he is a player for the big occasion: 17 of his 36 Premier League goals have come against City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal and Leicester, by common consent United’s six strongest opponents. Whatever the opposite of a flat-track bully is, that’s Rashford.And yet, for all the talk of a breakthrough – he’s never scored more than 10 league goals in a season and currently has nine – this is a campaign that has only recently kicked into life. For the first two months of the season Rashford’s vague listlessness seemed to mirror United’s. At one point he went on a run of one goal in 12 games.This remains, in many ways, the hit on Rashford: a tendency towards inconsistency, curious lapses in focus, a paucity of options for breaking down deep-set defences. What is interesting is that these were exactly the same criticisms being levelled at one of his opponents on Saturday evening.Rashford turned 22 just over a month ago. Raheem Sterling turns 24 on Sunday, and provides a salutary lesson in how a promising young player propels himself to the next level. When Sterling was the age Rashford is now, he had scored 23 goals in 114 league games – a rate of roughly one in five – and won nothing except the League Cup. Ever since, 51 in 126 – a rate of two in five – and two Premier League titles. The pressing issue is whether Rashford’s purple patch is just that or the beginnings of a Sterling-esque metamorphosis that will see him convert his rich, base-metal promise into reliable, trophy-winning excellence.Of course, the comparison is not a perfect one. Rashford and Sterling may both cut in off the left flank with pace, sharp one-twos and a keen nose for goal, but they are subtly different in many ways. Rashford is taller and stronger than Sterling, a better header of the ball, possesses a cleaner and more powerful shot and a more reliable set piece. In virtually every other area, however, you would probably take Sterling over him, a testament to the way in which he has matured and honed his game over the last couple of seasons under Pep Guardiola.Can Rashford grow in the same way under Ole Gunnar Solskjær that Sterling has under Guardiola? It’s not a process we should assume he can undertake on his own: players do not simply develop automatically, like house plants left in a sunny window. Sterling owes his improvement not only to his ferocious work ethic but to the little details and snatches of advice that make the good players great: when to take on his man and when to recycle, timing and positioning, composure, whether to trap a ball with the outside of a foot or take it in his stride.Rashford, meanwhile, is still a player who owes his goals to intuition and inidual flourishes as much as careful plotting. This, perhaps, explains why his record is so good against better teams, where space is more plentiful, counterattacks a more useful tactic and games far more likely to turn on a single moment of brilliance. But it also highlights the biggest area of opportunity in his game: movement, reading buildup, finding himself in the positions to score the ugly goals that have swollen Sterling’s output.Will he get that sort of help at United? Solskjær’s comments after the Tottenham game, underlining Rashford’s “courage” and “directness”, describing him like a striker who looked as if he were “in the playground with his mates”, suggested he sees Rashford’s gift in largely discrete, inidualistic terms rather than as part of a more cultivated development. In short: he is good and, if he is happy, he’ll carry on being good. The hope is that behind closed doors, Solskjær is offering Rashford the sort of bespoke insights that made him himself such a devilishly shrewd striker.And perhaps the wider moral here is one of patience. Sterling did not suddenly start banging them in as soon as he turned 22: improvement came in stages, by degrees, a slow melting of potential. Likewise Rashford is a striker who has spent much of his career in a struggling team, oscillating between the No 9 and the left-wing position, and who, despite playing more than 100 league games, is a month younger than Tammy Abraham.No player’s career goes in a straight line. And for any footballer of great promise there’s a point just before the big explosion, just before he takes the plunge, when nothing very much seems to be happening. A shimmy here, a shimmy there. You wonder which way he’s going to go. And for a moment all is stillness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40e29ae27e23b5e209ac8697db8d99b0d3a28599/310_215_3268_1962/master/3268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3631e8fd430e41364900cfcdbe2c1aee","title":"sam kerr the best player in the world tell us something we dont know","story":"Judged this week by the  as the best female footballer on the planet, Matildas captain Sam Kerr now has her chance to prove it on the European club stageAcross all the years I’ve watched Sam Kerr play football, there’s one moment that stands out as a true illustration of her character, as an example of why she’s been voted ’s Best Female Footballer of 2019.It’s not a goal, or a back-flip celebration, or a gesture of kindness towards a fan. It’s a moment of failure. One of the biggest in her career, perhaps, and one that feels more significant in hindsight.In July, at the Allianz Riviera stadium in Nice, Australia were knocked out of the World Cup by Norway. Kerr, whose name had become synonymous with goal scoring in the months leading into the tournament, had missed the Matildas’ first penalty. Her teammates soon followed, their shootout plan collapsing like a sandcastle whose foundations had crumbled and slid away beneath them.The moment I remember, though, came fifteen minutes later. The stadium had largely emptied except for a few hundred Australia fans who’d gathered near the sideline to applaud their players, some of whom were farewelling their World Cup journeys for the last time.But Kerr didn’t join them. She sat alone out in the middle of the pitch, her knees pulled up to her chest, her head hidden from view. She was the shape of defeat: the hunched, exhausted shoulders of someone who had been carrying something heavy for years, who’d done all she could but realised it still wasn’t enough.That moment flooded back to me when Chelsea FC announced they’d signed Kerr on a two-and-a-half-year deal, likely making her the most expensive female footballer ever. And that announcement came while this failure was still fresh in our memories, when the eyes of the world were trained upon her and she’d fallen short, both of their expectations and of her own.Sam Kerr has been The Sam Kerr of her respective teams for years. Sky Blue FC, Perth Glory, Chicago Red Stars, the Matildas — these teams have largely revolved around what the striker has offered them. Australian and American fans who’ve watched Kerr set goal-scoring records only to break them again the following season know that she has stood head-and-shoulders above most of her colleagues. But she’s had little to show for it by way of team success. Two championship finals without a trophy was her final contribution to the W-League and the NWSL before setting off for English shores.It’s this remarkable rise that has resulted in years’ worth of backlash from fans and players alike when Kerr has been snubbed by international football’s top gongs. Her omission from global football’s most coveted awards has always felt like a glitch, a flaw in the voting system itself a consequence, perhaps, of European and World Cup myopia. To the Australian and American audiences who have watched her since her meteoric rise began in 2016, Kerr has always been destined for greatness, the kind of player about whom clichés are written. She’s the big fish in the small pond, if that pond also included habitual World Cup winners and Fifa Player of the Year recipients.Europe may not be a bigger pond, but it is a different one, and one stocked with increasingly larger fish. Like her penalty in France, the whole world will be watching if she sinks or swims. And that is the point: the whole world, not just one half of it, will be watching Sam Kerr. And they’ll be watching her in her prime, in a team where she may no longer be the one relied upon to do the heavy lifting — no longer required to be The Sam Kerr. Or maybe she will. It’s as if her growing list of statistics and awards — the back-to-back Golden Boots, the MVPs, the ESPYs and Asian Player of the Years — couldn’t be believed on paper, so she had to go there and show them herself to plant herself firmly within Europe’s field of vision, almost daring them to continue ignoring her.But this acknowledgement by a leading European organisation before she’s even set foot on the continent is itself a demonstration of why she’s there: Kerr is a player who transcends the barriers that have kept women’s football clustered and on the periphery. Her top spot also signals a shift by global football’s media towards its female athletes and the systems that have kept some less visible than others. That may, in time, become her greatest contribution to the sport.For now, the team titles that have remained conspicuously elusive are now on the horizon, and the inidual awards — though she’s perhaps too modest to admit it — are suddenly, temptingly, within reach. This is a moment for a player who missed a World Cup penalty for Australia, but who is determined not to fall short of expectations again.Because she did eventually lift her head out of her hands on that pitch in Nice. She turned and gave that stadium one last, steely look before standing up and moving on. That, more than the goals or the records, showed us who Sam Kerr is: a player who now carries a great weight on her shoulders, who stumbles for a moment, but who does not allow herself to buckle. She was already one of the best footballers to ever play the game, whether she scored that penalty or not. And now, as she stands on the shore of a new era, Sam Kerr finally has her chance to prove it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc32ec63027a45a1231acedc8b5cda00170dab0/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2581d676322ee61d7b01e4dabf824544","title":"psg neymar mbappe champions league qatar glory","story":"Some things just sound better in French. See for example the above, taken from a report in Le Parisien of Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-0 home win against Nantes in midweek. This is definitely best read in the original, ideally in the sad, sonorous tones of Uncle Monty from the film Withnail and I staring wistfully out of a scullery window with a firm young carrot in one hand and a velveteen club-branded Neymar figurine in the other.Une idée, un fantasme dans nos rêves. What the man from Le Parisien is saying here, coming on like a cross between Baudelaire and a Fan TV stadium vox pop, is that PSG are in a bit of a state these days, albeit a fascinating one. This is still a winning machine. Victory on Wednesday left Thomas Tuchel’s team five points clear at the top of the table and they are already guaranteed first place in their Champions League group. Mauro Icardi and Edinson Cavani are an unusually regal pair of back-up strikers. In Idrissa Gueye and Marco Verratti they have a passing, covering midfield to die for.But something is still rotten in the state of Denmark. It is two and a half years since the most extraordinary single recruitment blitz in the history of sport. Neymar came to Paris first, snapped up in early August 2017 for a brain-mangling £198m. Kylian Mbappé followed three weeks later, in a deal rebranded, for obvious reasons, as a temp-to-perm loan. At the end of which Neymar and Mbappé have played just one (yes, one) Champions League knock-out game together in two years. Neymar missed both games against Manchester United with a foot injury last year. Before that both men played in the first leg defeat at Real Madrid, with Neymar once again injured for the decisive defeat in Paris. Fast forward to the present day and the Neymar‑Mbappé mini-era feels like it’s on the brink: caught between heaven and earth, still brilliantly high-functioning, but fragile too, and reaching the end of something.Mbappé scored the opening goal against Nantes, a clumsily, elegantly inventive little flick of the heel executed while tumbling over backwards. On 78 minutes he wandered off the pitch and sat looking sad and betrayed beneath a red blanket. A little later Neymar also ambled off looking even more broken, devastated, saddened. Neymar had just added the second goal, a penalty celebrated with a shushing gesture towards parts of a crowd that continue to boo him for trying to force a move away, and for not being Cavani.It was a significant moment in other ways. Get this. Wednesday night was also the first time Neymar and Mbappé had scored in the same game since January, 10 months during which they had spent only 120 minutes on the pitch in each other’s company. It makes for an extraordinary running total: £90m in wages since PSG’s two-man galáctico unit scored in the same game. And beyond that a combined wage and transfer bill of £570m on the pair of them.Here we have an entire half-a-billion goalscoring project based on getting these two men on the pitch together in the Champions League latter stages. At the end of which Neymar and Mbappé have played only one Champions League knockout games together in two years, the 3-1 first-leg defeat at Real Madrid in 2018. Neymar missed the return defeat in Paris with a foot injury and another ruled him out of both legs of last season’s tie against Manchester United.This situation would be more obviously comic if Mbappé and Neymar had proven to be a dysfunctional, poorly matched pair. But the truth is more subtle than that. The fact is they are great together. In 46 Neymar‑Mbappé games PSG have scored 150 goals, including 20 mutual assists. To date the real high-summer period was between September last year and January this, when they scored together in 10 games and PSG regularly racked up five or six.At which point, enter injury, stasis and unrest. It seems possible Mbappé will finally go to Madrid next summer. Neymar has been wandering around looking like a royal prince on a tour of a Victorian sewerage unit for at least the last six months. But both are now fit. From here they have a contained five-month run to make this work, to cut through all the animus, the interests, the industrial-sporting complex that follows these human talent-units around.Two things are pretty clear. Firstly, when he’s fit Mbappé is the most devastating centre-forward in the world. And secondly while he might be infuriating, an absurd sun king-ish figure, Neymar is also an amazing footballer, with a style that complements Mbappé perfectly when he dials back the showy jinks. How far can they take it now, with one more Champions League season to reach the end of this?Paris Saint-Germain: the Qatar Years may be a grisly thing in many ways. This is sport as a machine to gloss and launder the status of a wildly ambitious petro-state. You can’t kill the spirit though and PSG are a genuinely engrossing team right now, a group of players with a wonderful purity about them in those moments when football becomes just a thing on a rectangle of green, a business of shapes, angles, talent.For all the inanity and greed of the European club scene it is worth remembering that sport will still give us these defiant notes of beauty and poise.

Then oil companies arrived and wrought an environmental catastrophe• All photographs by Arteh Odjidja, whose work features in the exhibition Rise for Bayelsa, which runs in London until 20 December 2019 Almost every day, Udengs Eradiri is informed of another oil spill in Bayelsa state, in the Niger Delta. Most of the time, little or nothing is done to clean up the mess, says Eradiri, the state’s commissioner for the environment.Today, he added, you can spend the whole day without catching anything.Oil was first pumped in Bayelsa in 1956 by Shell. Since then, several international oil companies have extracted oil from across the Niger Delta.In Bayelsa and elsewhere, communities have faced an environmental catastrophe. About 40 million litres of oil are spilled every year across the Niger Delta, according to the Rise for Bayelsa campaign.Air, land and water have all been contaminated, with studies reporting devastating effects on residents’ health and livelihoods. Vast areas of the state’s waterways and mangrove swamps – one of the most erse ecosystems in Africa – have been destroyed or put at risk. Farmland has been cloaked in oil, contaminating crops and exposing people to high levels of heavy metals such as chromium, lead and mercury.Meanwhile, gas flares – where natural gas associated with petroleum extraction is burned off in the atmosphere – have filled the air with pollutants, and created acid rain.“It’s really telling on the people,” says Eradiri. Of Bayelsa’s estimated population of 2 million people, three-quarters rely on fishing or farming to support themselves. “Those communities are getting involved in other ways of surviving. And that’s why there’s been a lot of upsurge in criminal activities as well as artisan refining, all to survive.”Shell, one of the international oil companies operating in Bayelsa, says that oil spills due to crude oil theft, illegal refining and sabotage cause the most environmental damage in the Niger Delta.“Our aim is to run a responsible business, which means operating safely without harm to people and protecting the local environment. In Nigeria, we operate to the same standards as other Shell-operated ventures globally. No spill is acceptable, and we work hard to prevent them,” Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria said in a statement.“We work closely with the regulators, local communities and other stakeholders to address this challenging issue and, irrespective of cause, we clean up and remediate areas affected by spills from our facilities or pipeline network,” the statement added.It said that in the case of operational spills, compensation is paid to people and communities impacted.The company says its efforts to clean up areas have at times been hampered by instability, as its employees are unable to safely access affected areas.“If you want to resolve the issues in the Niger Delta, if you want to totally eradicate the compromise on infrastructure, you must involve communities in the contractual agreement,” says Eradiri. “That means it is not just owned by other people with other interests.”A recent study estimated that, in 2012 alone, 16,000 babies died within the first month of life because of oil pollution in the Niger Delta.Separate research, cited by the interim report of the Bayelsa State Oil and Environmental Commission, has found that pollution is placing communities at heightened risk of kidney damage, as well as diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Campaigners report increased cases of diarrhoea and child malnutrition.The commission’s interim report concluded that communities suffered life-changing health consequences as a result of oil pollution. The report added that they have also found it almost impossible to secure fair redress.The Rise for Bayelsa campaign, launched in March, is calling on international oil companies to clean up spills immediately, provide swift compensation to all communities affected, and develop long-term solutions to avoid spills. The campaign is also calling for oil companies to invest in sustainable projects in all communities in which oil companies operate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ce07d737de8896e8f1134989e162531e0ca06ea/0_372_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6e1e5202c91389e45ed7b09d4cc1e1","title":"tell us about your experiences of finding christmas love","story":"Whether you were actively looking or it happened unexpectedly, we want to hear your stories of meeting your partner at ChristmasChristmas can be a good time of year for romance.Cuffing season runs from 1 December – 15 January and is said to be the time when single people are more likely to want relationships.

My sister has no children or partner, is independent and retired I have a husband and a teenage son. Our parents are dead. I don’t like my sister: she is a feminist, political, clumsy, loud and overbearing. She has said that we are welcome to stay with her for Christmas (she lives abroad, but not too far), but I can’t do that there’s nothing for my son at her house, and I can’t afford a hotel and three flights. She said she could come to us, but told us not to worry if we are busy. I feel pressured to reply.When she’s here, I have to cook for her she’s useless at helping and wouldn’t think to offer to make a cup of tea. She stays in a B\u0026ampB and we pick her up and bring her to our house. The thought of her coming stresses me out so much. I try to have kind thoughts, but the reality is awful. When she has gone, it takes me a couple of weeks to get over it. She is a gracious hostess and makes everyone welcome, but I am not like that. I feel angry that she’s stipulated the days when she can come. I want to see other family and friends and, some days, not get dressed. I’m so angry. I’m not a lover of Christmas, and this makes it worse. (Although I’m not happy about her coming any time.) How can I stop these feelings? I’m not proud of them but, similarly, it’s my holiday, my time off work and I want to relax. You can’t stop these feelings, and neither should you, but it might help you to try to work out what their root really is. As with all issues with siblings, I bet this goes way back.It’s perfectly reasonable for your sister to text you wanting to know if you want to visit, or if she can visit you and it’s perfectly reasonable for you not to want to visit her, or have her visit you. What’s causing your angst is understanding what you actually want, and finding peace with that decision. What’s stopping you finding peace is guilt.First: what do you want to do? If you want to spend Christmas just the three of you, in your pyjamas, then what’s stopping you doing that? As you say, it’s your holiday, your time off. I know Christmas is important, but it also seems to make a lot of people unhappy as they are forced into doing things they don’t want to, with people they don’t like. There are more than 300 other days of the year when you can do that.You have the option of texting her back and saying, “Sorry, this year we are staying home, neither entertaining nor travelling” (the line in italics is my catchphrase, and it sets clear parameters). How she takes that information may surprise you, and maybe even disappoint you. But that’s her responsibility, not yours. You mention in your longer letter that when your sister is at your house, you can’t invite other people over because that’s not what she does at hers. But, it’s your house and your rules. Sometimes, inviting others can provide a bridge between how we are in the outside world and how we are with family, and make things more bearable. That’s another option if, or when, you do invite her.Then there’s the guilt: how she’s chosen to live her life is entirely her choice, and you aren’t responsible for that, either. But you are captain of your own ship. I have to say your sister sounds really independent and pretty sorted (despite the clumsiness) maybe she feels sorry for you and is trying to make Christmas nicer for you? Maybe in picking the days she is being decisive rather than controlling. As for not helping when she visits, given that she is such a good hostess, she may expect the same when she goes to see others.Be kind, to her and to yourself. You don’t like her and that’s OK. Lots of people don’t like their family. But be sure that you know what you want to do – and do it. There’s no point being inhospitable and then also being at home miserable and guilty.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

In 1938, when records began, there were 2,085 births to women over 45, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Births to women aged 25 and under have steadily decreased since records began. The figures show the average age of mothers and fathers increased for the 10th successive year, rising to 30.6 and 33.6 years respectively.The standardised mean age of mothers and fathers has increased by a total of 4.2 years since they were at their lowest on record in 1975 and 1974 respectively.Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said the latest figures highlighted the “sustained and unrelenting pressures” on midwives, maternity support workers and maternity services. The risk of complications rises for expectant mothers and their babies as women get older.“Our maternity services need the resources to be able to meet this growing demand and to ensure women, babies and their families get the safest and best possible care,” Walton added.In England, maternity services gained just 33 new midwives in the past year despite a shortfall of about 2,500, according to the RCM. “This will do little to help this situation,” Walton said. “The government’s own policy changes, which we support, to tackle issues such as the entrenched inequalities in health particularly in BAME communities will also need additional investment.”Stillbirth rates are higher to women living in the most deprived areas in England. In 2018, the stillbirth rate in the most deprived areas was 5.7 stillbirths per 1,000 total births, compared with 2.7 in the least deprived areas.Walton said: “I repeat the call in our recently published election manifesto for a root and branch review of maternity services funding and resources. It is needed and it is long overdue. The government have lofty ambitions which we are behind, but they need to ensure the service has what it needs to achieve them.”The ONS figures show the number of twins, triplets and quadruplets declined for the third consecutive year. Of every 1,000 women giving birth, 15.4 had a multiple birth in 2018, which was the lowest multiple maternity rate since 2007."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b11b66567b3a369bc6323ce7fe886ff5fc896518/105_162_1405_843/master/1405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a0131a93d4a79a47dff5eed316578d","title":"whats the best hangover cure for the morning after an election","story":"Whether you’re recovering from a festive night out or a stressful vote, what’s needed is a reliable pick-me-upBefore a BNO (Big Night Out) recently, I forgot to adjust the thermostat, which sets the heating to start at 6am. This meant that soon after coming home at 2am, merry and hot from booze, I began to dehydrate, dry heat wrinkling my wine-soaked body like an expensive cured sausage, although I didn’t feel so tasty.I have been working on my hangovers for years (tinkering, testing), trying to optimise them. I’ve tried it all – pickle juice, milk thistle – because if I can just remove the nausea and the nagging feeling that my colleagues hate me, hangovers could be wonderful. They are, as friends with children can attest, an immense privilege: lie-ins, fry-ups and binge-watching. Of course, the only true cure is abstinence, but the search has led me to discover “emotional hangovers”.An emotional hangover is the empty, lethargic feeling you have post-BNO, but without drinking. Usually, it follows an intense experience, be it the joy of getting married, or the disappointment of a failed test. Apparently, the brain responds to heightened emotion in a similar way to booze and reels from it in the same way.Perhaps my hangovers haven’t been in vain, because in between festive boozing this year, there’s an election – an extremely stressful and urgent contest, the significance of which exceeds anything I’ve seen. Despite never having had the pleasure of voting in an election where my party wins, I am still unprepared for it to lose.Next week’s result will probably leave me with a hangover of both kinds. And when I think of that morning, the reckoning, I know I won’t have a strategy to deal with it. But I have learned this tip I will share with you: that egg and chips and a bottle of Lucozade isn’t the worst place to start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bcfe17822256bb9102b426e5dfa63f8dbe01dc/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5545a04a4ade85c51d6b59e4889c7f67","title":"worried about the election dont its as futile as rewriting the past","story":"When you fret about the future, you’re demanding reassurance, yet this is something it can never give youThere’s a good chance that you’re worried, right now, about what the future holds. I raise this in the context of next week’s election and Brexit, of course, but that situation’s hardly unique: many of us are always worried about what the future holds, in some domain – and still would be even if politics suddenly started going our way. Which makes this as good a time as any to recall what a strange emotion worry is. No matter how much badness is in store for you, once you’ve taken whatever precautions you can, worry is largely useless. In prehistory, when threats were immediate and physical, a surge of anxiety could motivate evasive action. But that’s not true of most modern worries, whether they’re political, environmental, related to your job, your relationship or your kids instead, the anxiety just hangs around and feeds on itself. Honestly, it might be preferable just to have to outrun a sabre-toothed tiger every few weeks.It’s interesting to consider the asymmetry in our feelings about the future versus the past. Looking ahead, life’s unpredictability maddens us, and we worry because we feel, if subconsciously, that doing so will help bring the future under our control. (Or we act hyper-cautiously, also in hopes of controlling the future: “Dad suggests arriving at airport 14 hours early,” reads an Onion headline, apparently inspired by my childhood.) Yet, looking backwards – and I know I risk sounding like I’ve been consuming substances derived from the leaf of the cannabis plant here – isn’t it odd that we’re untroubled by the zigzagging path of coincidence and unpredictability that brought us to this point?“Sometimes I wake up with a feeling of childish amazement – why am I myself?” wrote Simone de Beauvoir. “What astonishes me… is the fact of finding myself here, and at this moment, deep in this life and not in any other… The penetration of that particular ovum by that particular spermatozoon, with its implications of the meeting of my parents and before that of their birth and the birth of all their forebears, had not one chance in hundreds of millions of coming about.”It’s no mystery that we should care more about the unpredictability of the future the past, after all, is water under the bridge. What’s bizarre about the energy we invest in fretting about the future is that we should imagine we ever could have much control over, or knowledge of it, given how little we had in the past. Countless coincidences and blind historical forces made you who you are today. Wouldn’t it be reasonable to assume they’ll play an overwhelming role in what happens next? And doesn’t that drive home the fact that worrying about it can’t possibly be productive?I don’t mean to imply you can reason yourself out of worry entirely. But there’s some liberation in realising the truth: when you worry, you’re demanding reassurance, yet this is something you’ll definitely never get from the future, for the simple reason that it hasn’t occurred yet. Certainly, it’s worth taking action in the present to increase the probability that things will go well. But that’s as far as your influence extends. In a profound sense, the future itself is none of your business.In Back To Sanity, psychologist Steve Taylor argues that ‘elsewhereness’ – including mentally living in the future – is a mental disorder, from which it’s possible to escape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd87daad79e76d13080facb1797e720d2dfc98e3/362_76_2636_1582/master/2636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a1e8cd70913214b309a837f670197ba","title":"dogs cats uk supermarkets festive snacks","story":"Tesco and Sainsbury’s stock own-brand mince pies for dogs, plus ‘Pawsecco’ for catsPet pampering has gone festive with special turkey-flavoured mince pies among the Christmas treats on sale to dog owners.For the first time, Tesco and Sainsbury’s supermarkets are selling own-brand mince pies for dogs. Conventional recipes are a potential yuletide horror for dogs because raisins and sultanas are toxic for canines, prompting Britain’s two biggest supermarkets to offer dog-friendly alternatives. Tesco has also launched a range of macarons for small breed dogs, filled with mutt-friendly yoghurt.It is all a far cry from the old days when the family dog might be tossed a discarded turkey bone, and follows pet owners’ spiralling expenditure on their four-legged companions at Christmas.It follows the more general trend of cat and dog owners wanting to buy the same products for their animals as they do for themselves, extending at Christmas to pet gifting through festive stockings, accessories and outfits as well as food and treats.The pet Advent calendar market has become firmly established – and is offered by numerous retailers – since the first one was launched in the UK by Lily’s Kitchen five years ago, when it manufactured a modest 5,000. That has grown to more than 50,000 this year, shipped to nine countries across Europe, the Middle East and Asia.This week the brand got significant celebrity endorsement when Victoria Beckham released a video on Instagram showing her daughter, Harper, opening one of the company’s dog Advent calendars and handing the treats to her two cocker iels.Its new macarons are made exclusively by a family-run pet food business based near Boston, Lincolnshire, which grows the wheat that goes into pet biscuits.Helen Coxon, Tesco pet food product development manager, said: “We’ve had great success since launching our Christmas pet range with novel, humanised products that bring fun at Christmas.“This year we wanted to launch a product that is perfectly proportioned for smaller dogs as well as bringing more elegance into the range. More and more people are making sure the family pet doesn’t feel left out at Christmas and these macarons are aimed at them.”Sainsbury’s is selling its first dog-friendly mince pies in stores across the country after a trial earlier this year. Made with carob, which is a pet-friendly chocolate alternative, the festive pies are topped with turkey-flavoured biscuit stars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1aed3f064f2bc15315891541a58d53656f5634c/1030_618_2646_1588/master/2646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd90a7108cbf8be4fbc05d49383ce36a","title":"krept and konan review","story":"O2 Arena, LondonThis UK duo prove the best revenge is living well in a flawless gig that begins with a flash and ends with heart and soul‘I feel like everything has led up to this moment.” These are the solemn words of UK rapper Krept (real name: Casyo Johnson) in a short film titled The Road to the O2, which documents him and musical partner Konan (Karl Wilson) on their journey from being independent artists to headlining the 20,000-strong venue. But does that sense of occasion translate to the show itself? Within two minutes of it beginning – with a 3D re-creation of the old-fashioned sweetshop on their album cover, a sprinkling of pyrotechnics, a choreographed fleet of hooded figures pretending to be Krept and Konan, and the appearance of four giant inflatable goats – the answer is a resounding yes.This is not to say that Krept and Konan rely on gimmicks. After the flashy showmanship of their intro, all they need to unite the room is the bolshy, instantly recognisable force of their six-year-old hit Don’t Waste My Time. Leaders in UK rap for a decade (their aforementioned documentary includes footage of their first-ever gig, opening for Skepta in 2011), the two have an easy chemistry that’s magnetic to watch: they slide effortlessly from hip-hop singles to grime freestyles to dancehall-inflected album cuts.Though they’ve been around for a decade, 2019’s Revenge Is Sweet is only the pair’s second album (following countless mixtapes, remixes and freestyles). The revenge of the title is aimed at the establishment media and music industry that have rarely taken them seriously. But while it flirts with sinister imagery, the record is a celebratory reminder that the best revenge is living well. That sense of celebration makes the pair’s appearance at the O2 so unforgettable. This is a joyful victory lap that’s shared with the crowd, whether Krept and Konan are floating across the stadium on a moving platform, leading an Afrobeats versus bashment dance battle, or encouraging the crowd to yell “wanker” at a video of a Boris Johnson lookalike before performing their song Liar Liar.What makes Revenge Is Sweet feel especially significant is that, having featured many high-profile American artists (Jeremih, Rick Ross) on their 2015 debut, Krept and Konan worked with a fleet of their British peers on the follow-up, instilling the record with a vehement sense of pride and community. That spirit powers the best portions of the live show, as a big red button and some Street Fighter-inspired visuals are used to ceremoniously announce each of their special guests, which include Stefflon Don, king of hooks MoStack and grime stalwart Stormzy. They also pay their moment forwards, making room for new faces, as afro-bashment group NSG come out to perform their viral summer hit OT Bop.But the show’s most poignant moments come at its close, with an uplifting tribute to rapper Cadet, who was killed by a dangerous driver in 2018, and a performance of Broski. The most heartbreaking song on Revenge, it was dedicated to their friend and business partner Nash Chagonda, who killed himself last year. Krept’s voice crumbles as he raps: “Now my heart’s broken that we have to go without him.” It’s one of many moments balances Krept and Konan’s hilarious and show-stealing production with genuine heart and soul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd9278c8ad6945da133f7880a8cb73b4b8323c5/0_340_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a96acd68cd4d9f1d91ceb89371f79e","title":"liam payne lp1 review capitol","story":"(Capitol)One Direction’s Mr Boring lets his inner sexual piranha loose – with frightening resultsLiam Payne recently lamented that when One Direction’s management realised he was the sensible one, they made him keep his bandmates in check. Getting cast as Mr Boring was annoying, he explained, yielding him the least screams from fans. Happily for Payne, solo freedom has let him reap maximum screams and embrace his officiousness: with 3.7bn streams, he is the most commercially popular 1D member.It’s hard to see why. Despite LP1’s effortful attempts to cast Payne as a sexual piranha, the 26-year-old generally comes off as an uptight scold. On Hips Don’t Lie, he stares at a woman’s groin as she dances and warns that she’d better not be wasting his time. “I hope your hips don’t lie unless they’re lying with me,” he sings, a conclusion so deathly it feels like a funeral for reproduction. The thrumming Rude Hours finds him inviting a lady to a “parking lot”. “Might be a bad idea,” he admits, “I’ll probably do your ass in the car.” But never let it be said that Payne is boring and responsible: “Key unlocks the door, ticket on the floor.” If it’s a pay and display, there’ll be murder if it’s not clearly visible. Stack It Up is halfway between a 2003 50 Cent single and the Tory manifesto: “If you wanna stack it up,” he advises, “you gotta work for it.”Such are the accidental highs of an album empty of intentional humour, heart, or anything much human at all beyond base carnality. Its generic trap and Latin-tinged production and its many guest rappers suggest Payne is trying to keep pace with Drake and the Weeknd. He can’t, because his rank randiness lacks the sense of guilty pleasure that makes his Canadian contemporaries irresistible. The simmering Both Ways, about a woman who loves threesomes, finds him and her “sharing that body like it’s our last meal”, like cheetahs at a carcass. On Familiar, he admires a lady who’s “shaped like a model or some kind of bottle” – Orangina? Ketchup? Perhaps this leg-crossing horror show is another sign of Payne’s prudence: LP1 is a terrible pop album, but very effective contraception."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa22653aa4c2813613611c50d0e63c188a8f552/0_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cfa7762f75beec1a808b0a574bb253","title":"election 2019 inside momentum podcast","story":"Anushka Asthana reports from inside Momentum, the grassroots movement hoping to propel Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street.

She was the UK’s ambassador to Georgia for three years until 2016, and was head of the Foreign Office human rights department. She also served in Bangkok, New Delhi and Bogotá. She was seconded to the US state department from 2002 to 2004, working on promotion of human rights and democracy in the Middle East.She was still working at the embassy on Friday, but is due to leave in the week before Christmas. She is married to the American head of the International Republican Institute, Daniel Twining.“She was really good at her job and really well respected around town,” said a source who had frequent dealings with Hall Hall over Brexit and its consequences. “She has done everything right, and has had legitimate concerns. This is not something that has just developed in the past week or two. It dates back, but I had the impression her concerns were being dealt with internally. I am surprised it has come to this.”A foreign office spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on the detail of an inidual’s resignation.”After her posting in Tbilisi, Hall Hall had taken a break from government, moving to Washington to become a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, where her writing focused on the need for western solidarity in the face of Vladimir Putin’s expansionism. But last year, she took the Brexit counsellor job at the embassy.“She was a Remainer, but she told me that at the end of the day she supported her country and her government and she saw the role as crucial to making a success of the transition,” a former colleague recalled.Daniel Fried, a former US assistant secretary of state for Europe, said: “Ambassador Hall Hall is known to her US colleagues, myself included, as a person of integrity and insight. I cannot comment on the specifics of her charges, but she is a credible and serious person and as such her words carry weight.”Nile Gardiner, director for the Margaret Thatcher Centre for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said: “It is very, very disappointing to see a British diplomat not implementing the official policy of their government.”“Diplomats should not be giving their own interpretation of information provided by their own government,” Gardiner added.The UK embassy has been without an ambassador since July, when Kim Darroch resigned following the leak of internal foreign office cables in which he described the Trump administration as dysfunctional, faction-riven and inept. The nomination of a successor has been delayed by political turmoil in Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa2ef7c28ffef8955ea54c8c7d2065969f6fbef/0_239_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6650415a57ae29f381ff275e831f8aee","title":"labour vows to electrify englands entire bus fleet by 2030","story":"Jeremy Corbyn says Tories have left people ‘isolated and stuck at home’ The Labour party has pledged to electrify England’s entire bus fleet by 2030, promising to bring services “into the future”.Jeremy Corbyn said “the Westminster bubble” didn’t care about buses, despite the fact that so many people rely on them. He said the Conservatives had overseen the cancellation or reduction of 3,000 routes across the country leaving people “isolated and stuck at home”.Labour has pledged to give local authorities the power to regulate bus services and create council-owned bus companies, allowing them to bring down the cost of tickets. In areas where bus services are brought into public control, bus travel would be free to under-25s.“The Westminster bubble doesn’t care about buses but cuts to bus routes leave so many people isolated, stuck at home and unable to make vital trips out,” said Corbyn.“Away from London, many people have approached me in this election to talk about their local bus route closing down.“This policy will bring our bus services into the future and help to revitalise our high streets and rebuild local communities. We want people to be proud of their local bus service.”Labour\u0027s \u0027green new deal\u0027 - or \u0027green industrial revolution\u0027 - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport,\u0026nbsptackling the UK’s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model.Although the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging\u0026nbspeconomic benefits in the medium term,\u0026nbsppositioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years.Crucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. Its advocates say jobs in carbon-intensive industries would be replaced by – among others – those in wind, solar, house building and transport infrastructure.Labour\u0027s manifesto put the green new deal at the centre of its\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspelection campaign. The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US\u0026nbsp2020 race.\u0026nbspInternationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west’s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants.Approximately 700 of the 35,000 buses in England are currently electric, most of which are in London. Labour calculates that the cost of electrifying the rest of the fleet over a 10-year period would be under £4bn, and would be funded through their £250bn Green Transformation Fund.The party said its costing was based on analysis of the price difference between electric and conventional buses, and included estimates for reimbursing owners of conventional buses for retiring the vehicles early.The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, accused the Conservative party of not caring about “buses nor the people and communities who rely on them”.“The Tories’ manifesto didn’t pledge a penny to reverse a decade of cuts to local bus services,” he said. “Buses are by far the most used and most important form of public transport but huge budget cuts have caused bus use to plummet to an all time low.”The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, hit back, saying: “Labour’s war on the motorist continues apace.”“Labour won’t be able to deliver a modern bus network because they would raid the roads’ budget and scrap vital new roads and upgrades to fund their fantasy giveaways,” he said. “Corbyn’s Labour would bring gridlock to our roads and gridlock to parliament with their plans for another two chaotic referendums next year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4704845d04c69edec082ed093af1da7c6d156b8c/57_0_647_388/master/647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f132914b09aa1c17f4d71940404204a","title":"election polls uk 2019 latest opinion poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead using our opinion poll tracker.

Possible explanations include the baby missing out on exposure to vaginal microbes.Such findings have raised concerns that caesarean deliveries may be linked to the epidemic of expanding waistlines. However, the latest research suggests this is not the case. “These two are not linked. The increase in caesarean section globally could not explain the obesity epidemic,” said Alqvist.Dr Audrey Gaskins, of Emory University in the US, whose previous research identified a link to obesity, welcomed the findings. However, she said Sweden and the US might differ in when or how caesareans were performed, and differences in the “obesogenic” environment between the two countries may also explain the conclusions.Writing in the journal Plos Medicine, Ahlqvist and colleagues report how they drew on data relating to men born between 1982 and 1987 who were conscripted into the Swedish military service before 2006.On conscription, medical data was collected on the men, including their body mass index (BMI). Data relating to their mode of delivery at birth, as well as characteristics of the mother, was then taken from a national birth register, and data from other records was used to look at parental education levels. Once the team took into account a host of factors including BMI of the mother before pregnancy, maternal smoking, age of the mother and education level of the parents, the trend was no longer apparent. Indeed, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was found to be the strongest factor influencing the trend.In other words, the team say, while men born by caesarean tended to end up slightly heavier as young adults, the mode of delivery was not a factor.However, the new study has limitations, including that the use of historic data from conscripts meant it involved only men, and subjects did not have severe health conditions. Dr Pat O’Brien, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the study suggested factors such as the BMI of the mother before pregnancy explained associations between caesarean birth and obesity in offspring.“In other words, being overweight is known to increase the risk of both caesarean birth and childhood obesity this, and other confounding factors, account for the previously suggested link between caesarean birth and offspring obesity,” he said.O’Brien added that a caesarean delivery could be lifesaving to both mother and baby and that women should be supported however they chose to give birth.“Women can be reassured that if they have a caesarean birth for any reason, whether planned or emergency, it does not increase the chances that their child will be obese,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aabeac73bd9b99ffc2cad9b09fb5fd1e64854258/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7fcf73717b3ac0e72444100924214b","title":"bath clermont auvergne european champions cup match report rugby","story":"Nothing less than victory was going to save Bath in Europe this season and the guillotine has in effect now fallen. Three straight defeats in Pool 3 before a trip to the Massif Central is not the stuff of Champions Cup dreams and their great Heineken Cup days of yore are an increasingly distant memory.Clermont only rarely had to shift much beyond third gear to claim a comfortable bonus-point win, sealed with three final-quarter tries, two of them from their debutant winger Samuel Ezeala, who also set one up for his more experienced flanker Alexandre Lapandry. Aside from a nice first-half try from Rhys Priestland Bath were left with precious little to show for their efforts on another grim evening for their long-suffering supporters.This was the 100th game Bath have played in Europe but it is starting to feel like another lifetime since they won the big prize in 1998. Just about the only consolation for the Rec faithful was the return of the former Bath favourite Nick Abendanon, who was making his 50th tournament appearance, but otherwise this was a second forgettable Friday night in succession under the Somerset lights. “History would suggest it’s a foregone conclusion for us now,” acknowledged their “frustrated” director of rugby, Stuart Hooper.The heavy surface again did not help, Bath having previously got bogged down against Saracens here last week. Until they develop some backline fluency it is going to be a long season, with their Premiership campaign also producing little joy, even if the powerful Clermont pack were always going to be hard to subdue.By far Bath’s best moments came before half-time, not least Priestland’s 13th-minute score. With the whole of Clermont expecting the outside-half to attempt a drop-goal the Welsh fly-half instead scooted left and, with the French defence flat-footed, cut through to score the game’s first points.His angled conversion was also spot on and visibly boosted home confidence, with Jonathan Joseph putting Jamie Roberts through another gap which, on another day, might have yielded a try, too. With some of the floodlights temporarily failing as well, it was looking an increasingly gloomy night for the visitors.Clermont, though, are the kind of team who can flick the switch at any moment. With the stadium lights also fully restored, their captain, Morgan Parra, went on a curving run behind a couple of teammates and gave his centre George Moala enough space to crash over. Parra converted to level the scores but a penalty in front of the posts six minutes before the interval should have given Bath a useful half-time lead. Instead, rather oddly, they chose to gamble on a kick to the corner, only for Clermont to defend the resultant maul with some ease.Having lost by one and six points respectively in their two previous pool games, the margins in Europe are too fine to mess about, particularly on gluepots like this. If, like Exeter, the driven lineout is a consistent weapon, it is a risk worth taking. Bath, unfortunately, are not yet the sum of their expensive parts, particularly with several forwards out injured.They also failed to benefit from the influential Parra failing to return for the second half. His replacement Greig Laidlaw coolly landed a couple of characteristically neat penalties to trump one from Priestland but, although a third attempt out of the mire from almost 50 metres unsurprisingly fell short, it did not ultimately matter. Ezeala’s nicely angled line earned him a deserved 66th-minute try before the promising 19-year-old, who was born in Barcelona, supplied the supporting Lapandry with a deft try-scoring pass two minutes later and then grabbed a second for himself. Joseph’s late try was little consolation.There will be more of the same – and possibly worse – awaiting Bath in France next weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bafbecce8403f099d02aabdb3907fcce608eccd1/0_59_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e157eabd1b8e09dd3b647a3f049e4899","title":"moeen ali england south africa","story":"Moeen Ali is expected to continue his break from Test cricket despite talks with Joe Root and the England management this week.Ed Smith, the national selector, will name England’s squad for the series in South Africa on Saturday, with Jonny Bairstow, Jimmy Anderson and Mark Wood tipped to return after missing out on the 1-0 series defeat in New Zealand.But Moeen is not expected to be among the touring party. The 32-year-old agreed a spell out of Test consideration at the end of the season after being dropped one match into the Ashes and then omitted from the list of Test central contracts.The latter decision by England has had a knock-on effect, with Moeen’s value as an established international cricketer on the global T20 circuit now greater than the overseas tour and match fees earned by a non-contracted player.On Friday he was signed on a £150,000 deal to play for Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League, the side being run by the former England team director, Andy Flower, and England’s head analyst, Nathan Leamon.The PSL runs from 20 February to 22 March, the back end of which coincides with England’s two-Test tour to Sri Lanka. Root and the selectors will likely touch base with Moeen again before that squad is picked, given the off-spinning all-rounder was central to the 3-0 series win there last year with 18 wickets.Moeen’s absence means Matt Parkinson is expected to continue as one of two spinners in the England Test squad who depart for South Africa on 13 December, although his Lancashire teammate, Saqib Mahmood, may be the seamer to make way for the returning Anderson and Wood.The pair, on the comeback trail from calf and side injuries respectively, are in South Africa as part of a fast-bowling camp, which has been forced to move from Potchefstroom to Cape Town owing to bad weather.Bairstow is also on the trip reconditioning his batting against the red ball. His inclusion in the England squad who play four Tests, starting on Boxing Day, will provide proper cover for Jos Buttler behind the stumps even if the management are keen for him to force his way back into the side as a batsman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30411a75d23a4ed0d4d6653d532d4d16acfa1874/0_117_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbb76721274bcfbd59a932d233dbf1b","title":"talking horses janika solid selection competitive tingle creek horse racing tips","story":"The step back in distance helped Janika score at Exeter and he ilooks ready for a step up to the highest level at SandownIn the absence of Altior the Tingle Creek at Sandown has a very competitive look and there is hope for fans of the veteran Un De Sceaux, the upstart Defi Du Seuil and the rarely spotted Waiting Patiently. But all three may be outdone by Janika (3.00), whose form over the past year looks all the more solid because it has often been in handicaps.After joining Nicky Henderson from France he was a beaten favourite in all four starts last winter but there was no shame in twice failing narrowly to give lumps of weight to Sirruh Du Lac. The step back to this distance helped him score at Exeter last month and he is clearly ready to give them all a fright at the highest level.At 13-8, Defi Du Seuil is very short for a horse who would be getting weight from five of these rivals in a handicap. He comfortably held Politologue last time and the market has accepted that as a strong piece of form but the grey’s record in Grade Ones is just 210.At 11, Un De Sceaux would be the oldest winner in the 40-year history of the Tingle Creek and he could have used more recent rain. That might also be true of Waiting Patiently as he tries two miles for the first time in three years. Sceau Royal appears to have been chosen by jockey Daryl Jacob over Janika and demands respect, having won the Henry VIII at 11-1 on this card two years ago. The drying ground is a help to him, though his stable could be in better form.1.30 Aintree It is easy to see Vieux Lion Rouge running a big race in the Becher, a race he won three years ago when only 3lb below the rating he has now. There have been some disappointments since then but his reappearance win at Chepstow was encouraging and the David Pipe yard continues in fine form.1.50 Sandown It is asking a lot for a horse to be pitched straight into Grade One company on his first try over fences but Grand Sancy could be up to it, for a trainer who has won this race three times in the past six years. His hurdles form certainly shows he has the necessary quality he was beaten only half a length in the Tolworth here in January.2.05 Aintree The well-related Midnight’s Gift looks one to stick with after a game effort to prevail on her hurdles debut at Fakenham.2.25 Sandown Apart from a blip at Cheltenham in October Smarty Wild has been improving all year and the handicapper may not yet have caught up with him.2.40 Aintree If race fitness makes the difference here, Black Corton ought to come out on top, being the only one to have run in the past 200 days. But the terms of the race hardly help him, as he must give 6lb to three classy rivals. Native River is marginally more appealing, though he could get outpaced in these conditions. Perhaps the blinkers will help.3.15 Aintree Tom Scudamore might get a double over the big, green fences, as Ultragold knows his way round here, having twice won the Topham. The Becher was too far for him on this day last year but he has since come down to a fair mark.3.35 Sandown Stan Sheppard and Coningsby were parted at the first at Ascot a fortnight ago but it is to be hoped they have a happier experience here because the young chestnut is of interest, now that Tom Lacey is firing in winners. The blinkers helped this one score easily at Exeter in March and there should be more to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db10a2052f357c33c6f7be6bd718c8787d2de2f5/0_0_6004_3603/master/6004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=648d97bbfcde55c5ec89f0cdeee976d0","title":"elon musk vernon unsworth trial verdict","story":"Vernon Unsworth’s legal team had sought at least $190m in damages after Tesla CEO called him ‘pedo guy’Elon Musk did not defame British cave explorer Vernon Unsworth by calling him a “pedo guy” on Twitter, a Los Angeles jury found Friday.Musk shook hands with his lawyer at the close of the four day trial in Los Angeles. He did not address Unsworth, whose team had told the court earlier on Friday the Tesla CEO should pay at least $190m in damages for his tweets about the er.“My faith in humanity is restored,” Musk told reporters in the hallways of the courtroom.“I came here for a verdict and unfortunately it was not what I expected but I respect the jury’s decision,” Unsworth said after emerging from the courtroom about an hour after the verdict was read.“The challenge that was thrown down by Elon Musk was that if you don’t sue it’s true,” said his lead attorney, L Lin Wood. “We sued because it’s false.”Mark Stephens, Unsworth’s solicitor in the UK, said: “It is a pity that a bullying billionaire has been able to cast such a long shadow, and I just hope that nobody else has to go … toe to toe with Mr Musk.”The case pitted a 64-year-old financial adviser earning a salary of about £25,000 ($33,000) against one of the richest and most famous men in the world. The dispute stemmed from the Tesla and SpaceX chief’s ancillary involvement in the Tham Luang cave rescue in June and July 2018, which saw 12 young football players and their coach successfully extracted from a flooded cave system by a team of British cave ers.On 13 July 2018, after the successful completion of the rescue, Unsworth said in an interview with CNN that the rescue pod Musk had delivered to the cave site was a “PR stunt”, adding that he should “stick his submarine where it hurts”. A video clip of the interview went viral, drawing the ire of Musk.Musk eventually deleted the tweets and apologized to Unsworth. He apologized again from the witness stand and contended, “I did not accuse Mr Unsworth of being a pedophile.”While much of the evidence presented to the jury over three days of testimony involved the details of the cave rescue and the aftermath of Musk’s tweets, the jury was tasked with determining whether a reasonable person would understand the tweets to mean that Musk was calling Unsworth a pedophile.Musk’s attorneys argued that the tweet was not a statement of fact, but an insult, which is considered protected speech. They also attempted to show that Unsworth’s reputation had not been seriously damaged because his efforts in the rescue operation were rewarded with an MBE, a medal from the Thai king, and other honors.“It doesn’t matter that it’s not the most common insult,” Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, said during closing arguments. “You’re free to speak certain things in this country.”Spiro further argued that Musk’s statement should never have been considered unlawful behavior. “Federal courts are not meant for people who insult each other,” he said.Unsworth testified that “being branded a pedophile” had made him feel “humiliated, ashamed, dirty”. “I was effectively given a life sentence without parole,” he said. “It hurts to talk about it.”His attorneys introduced evidence of the broad dissemination of Musk’s tweets, which were reported in 490 English-language articles on 361 websites in 33 countries.They also introduced evidence of Musk’s behavior after the 15 July tweets, including his hiring of a private investigator to seek proof of Unsworth’s “nefarious behaviour”. The investigator was actually a conman, but Musk relied on his false information when he called Unsworth a “child rapist” in an email to a BuzzFeed News reporter in August 2018.“Elon Musk is a liar,” said Wood, Unsworth’s attorney, in his closing argument. Musk, who attended court Friday for the first time since his testimony, raised an eyebrow at the remark.Wood pointed to inconsistencies in Musk’s testimony, tweets, and communication with a reporter. He compared the impact of the “pedo guy” tweet on Unsworth’s life to a “nuclear bomb”, with invisible but lasting affects.In explaining his suggestion of a $190m in damages, Wood said of the billionaire: “What he needs is a hard slap on the wrist.”The jury ended up deliberating for less than an hour. The foreman, Joshua Jones, said the panel decided that Unsworth’s lawyers spent too much time trying to appeal to their emotions and not concentrating on the evidence.“The failure probably happened because they didn’t focus on the tweets,” Jones said after the verdict was announced. “I think they tried to get our emotions involved in it. In a court of law you have to prove your case, which they did not prove.”The Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd33ceae1ec83e5c1df8745c1b7f639bfa268353/7_0_1812_1088/master/1812.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e9e6380cafeaf71094792db1bb4f7a1","title":"ctrl alt deliver why silicon valley must go out with a bang","story":"After six seasons, Mike Judge’s tech comedy is almost at an end – but it’s less ‘well oiled machine’, more ‘system error’. It’s time to give it the ending it deservesSilicon Valley ends this week. It ends for good. And more than any other show in recent memory, Mike Judge’s startup sitcom needs to deliver. After nearly six years on the air, this final season has been so hit and miss that it’s bound to be defined by its finale. End it well, and the show will go down as one of the smartest comedies of the decade. But one wrong move could throw its failings into sharp relief, and it will go out as a middling, quickly forgotten sitcom.I have to say, I expected a lot more from this season. The end has been coming for a while, and the creators have had plenty of time to build a muscular climax. That is what shows are supposed to do. Breaking Bad gave Walter White a machine gun and figured out what he should do with it. The first scene of the final run of Mad Men contained the “om” that would conclude the final episode. When a show has the finish line in sight, it has a chance to define what it is. It is an opportunity to say something big about itself, about us.But so far, that hasn’t really happened on Silicon Valley. Although it started strongly – so strongly that I raved about its potential a few weeks ago – nothing about this season has felt like a finale. Worse, for a long stretch in the middle, all the momentum drained out of it. Silicon Valley should have been sprinting to the end, but it got caught chasing its tail.I think that, at its heart,the show has always been about the intersection of ethics and power. Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) was always a genius with an amazing idea – a decentralised internet – that he fought hard to keep, in the face of ruthless competition from bigger players. The first episode this year reinforced this notion, that he was the sole face of good in the curdled world of tech, and the question seemed to be whether or not he could maintain his integrity to the bitter end.But instead, he has been playing the same game of footsie with Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) that he has been dragging out for years. Belson tries to destroy Pied Piper. Richard thinks of a way to sabotage him. He tells Belson too early. Belson changes his tactics and wins. Richard snatches partial victory from the jaws of defeat. There is no movement to it. Everyone ends up back in the same place. As a viewer, it is frustrating.The Gilfoyle, Dinesh and Monica problem – they have spent years with nothing to do – hasn’t gone away either. Every second of time is precious in a final season, but Silicon Valley has spent episode after episode engaging them in sub-Cheers contests with one another to see who can get the better of HR or each otherLast week’s episode is the perfect example. With just three episodes left, the characters should have been racing to a fixed point together. Instead, there was a lot of waffle about Richard signing a meaningless pledge, while Monica and Gilfoyle attempted to boost their management statistics. That’s it. It could have been any episode from any series, which isn’t really good enough at this point.Luckily, this week’s episode seemed to at least understand that it was a penultimate episode of an entire television series. PiperNet was finally tested at scale and, without sabotage from a rival, failed. And then it succeeded, better than anyone could have anticipated. For almost the first time this season, Silicon Valley is now in brand new territory.So now we have to see where it goes. It might end with success – with Pied Piper finally toppling the established tech hierarchy. It might end with failure, asPiperNet grows sentient, ruins everything and sends Richard back to the room where he started six years ago. But whatever it chooses, Silicon Valley has to be bold. It’s the only thing that can save it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb74c2fe021248f23effe12a62aba95a6e9eb73f/0_71_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4f2f2625ae3509c2027c7aa1f5910fc","title":"michigan adoption boy kindergarten class","story":"Classmates of five-year-old Michael Clark Jr sat in the courtroom holding paper hearts on sticks in supportFive-year-old Michael Clark Jr sat facing a judge in a Michigan courthouse with his entire kindergarten class in the pews behind him in solidarity. Each one of them held up a pink or red paper heart, some of them barely able to see above the wooden barrier iding the courtroom.“There is not a dry eye in Judge Patricia Gardner’s courtroom,” Kent county, Michigan, posted on its Facebook page on Thursday as Michael and 36 other children were officially adopted. Michael became a foster child to Andrea Melvin and Dave Eaton a year ago, according to local news station Woodtv, before formally being adopted by them this week.“I understand we are joined by Michael’s kindergarten classroom and teacher,” Judge Gardner of the 17th circuit court family ision, festively wearing a necklace of Christmas ornaments, said as she began National Adoption Day proceedings in Michigan. Even she shed a few tears as she welcomed all 37 children into her courthouse.Michael took a seat with a stuffed animal in his arms, later joining the judge in her chair. He swiveled back and forth, when it was his turn. He banged the judge’s gavel, all the while smiling, as his classmates looked on. Later, his class posed with him, with all of their pink and red hearts waving at the camera.His kindergarten teacher told reporters Michael’s classmates wanted to be there for him on his special day, saying: “We rise when we support others.”“I love my mommy!” Michael interrupted his mother as she did an interview after he became an official part of the family.He told his parents earlier he wanted what he called his “other family”, his classmates and teacher, to be there, too, on his big day. His mother had the same to say about Michael, adding to the love in the courtroom that day, “He’s just so full of energy and so full of love, it’s just been great for everybody.“We asked him and he said ‘You know, the class is kind of my family.’ And he wanted them to be there,” Eaton told Woodtv.Several children stood up to tell the court, “I love Michael” or “Michael’s my best friend,” his father added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a89ec0cce047cdaa6e51f7a4b52887627595e77/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61f06f8fb066135ae1e47e85290bae04","title":"its a free country now saudi arabia touts new openness","story":"Urban elites have largely embraced cultural transformation but elsewhere there is fear and angerRayan and Maha sat on the ground smoking, their schoolbags beside them and their smartphones blaring pop songs. School was in full session but they were at the mall, and they didn’t seem to care who knew it.Both girls were uncovered, their abayas held together by only a few buttons, as women dressed more conservatively in full black robes and niqabs breezed by carrying babies and shopping bags. Men in traditional thobes walked past without turning their heads, but the pair caught the eye of a Brazilian man wearing shorts and two full-sleeve tattoos, who stopped to try to talk to them.“I can do what I want,” said Maha, 16. “It’s a free country now, don’t you know?”For the two teenagers, truanting appeared to be more an act of youthful defiance than an expression of new-found freedom. But in Saudi Arabia these days, that two girls are willing to publicly rebel also testifies to tentative signs of a wider change in the kingdom.Two years into a reform programme aimed at opening up a rigid society to a sceptical world, what to wear and how to behave seem very much up for grabs. Strict dress codes have been modified for locals and abandoned for foreigners, laws restricting women’s movements have been rescinded, child custody has been made more equitable and segregation of men and women has been set aside.Rights group and critics in the west point out that the cultural reforms have been accompanied by a ruthless attempt to crush dissent. Activists, clerics and other perceived critics have been arbitrarily detained. A number of women’s rights activists allege that they have been sexually assaulted and tortured.On the question of cultural reform though, there are palpable signs of change. In the Saudi capital, a bastion of cultural austerity and oppression for nearly four decades, is now accepting allcomers. Wrestling troupes, global performers, homegrown singers, and boxers – including the world heavyweight champion Andy Ruiz Jr, who on Saturday faces Britain’s Anthony Joshua in a title rematch in Diriyah – are among a host of entertainers lured by the message that what was once forbidden is now welcome.The bare torsos of Joshua and Ruiz adorn posters across Riyadh promoting the kingdom’s first world heavyweight boxing match. Saudi Arabia has taken a leaf from the playbook of its neighbour Qatar, which has built its brand partly by luring global competitions including the 2022 football World Cup.So keen are leaders to tout the new openness, they held a conference during the week to discuss challenges facing the media, inviting international press including the . The gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul 14 months ago by Saudi state agents was not on the agenda, nor widespread restrictions on freedom of expression, which have long made Saudi Arabia one of the most opaque and difficult places in the world for journalistsThe cultural transformation, rolled out steadily since late 2017, has been dizzying, and largely embraced by urban elites in Riyadh and the second city, Jeddah, where much of what is now being sanctioned had been enjoyed in private for decades. But beyond the city limits, and even in the outer suburbs, the pace of change – and the fact it is happening at all – has caused resentment, anger and even shame.“I never thought I’d see this in my lifetime,” said Monira Salman Quaratah, who opened a coffee shop, Cafe Barbera, in a Riyadh suburb three years ago and on Thursday hosted a women’s empowerment forum that drew more than 15 local and foreign women to speak to a new foundation, Saudi Women Stories.“If I had tried to get such a gathering together back then, they would have shut it down,” she said. “But now this is a forum for everyone. And I couldn’t be happier. Sometimes I get a customer who complains about the music, or mixing, but I just tell them things have changed.”Among the group was a life coach, Bayan al-Hazimi, 29, who spends one week a month studying in London and the rest of her time working on a fledgling practice that she hopes will become a career.“People didn’t understand the difference between therapy and coaching at first,” she said. “But once you explain it to them, they get it. And I think it will be the same with people who don’t like the cultural changes. When they see people coming here and respecting them and our customs, they soften. The conservatives need to learn how to coexist.”Many in Riyadh and more in the country’s smaller communities seem disinclined to do that. In the eyes of some observers, rural conservatives in particular may never fully embrace the changes set in motion by the heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Salman.Cultural reforms were one plank of an attempt to re-engineer most aspects Saudi life – an ossified economy, implacable opposition to most entertainment and a rejection of anything depicting the pre-Islamic era.The push has dismantled a long-held accommodation that allowed the country’s leaders to run the affairs of state while hardline clerics defined and enforced the national character. In its place, an Arab nationalist police state is emerging, underpinned by the heir to an absolute monarchy who has ruthlessly consolidated his power base while eliminating dissent.“This isn’t just a difficult bridge to cross,” said one observer who has spent much of the past two decades immersed in conservative Saudi society. “For many, it’s actually shameful. And shame is a very powerful notion in this part of the world. They are saying this is against the values of the kingdom and of the faith, that this is an imposition which pays no heed to values or customs.“The other thing is, they won’t dare speak against what is happening, because they have seen the price to pay for doing so. There is a culture of fear in Saudi Arabia now that wasn’t there before the reforms. The pact is: you can have your freedoms, but in return you lose your tongue.”Fear of cultural erosion remains strong within conservative ranks and is amplified by the western concerts and festivals now regularly passing through Riyadh. “If the cultural aspects were more indigenous,” there would be less pushback, said a second observer. “The conservatives need to be handled carefully here.”For Hazimi, the life coach, something has clearly changed among her conservative family. “I am now regularly going outside my comfort zone,” she said. “I would not have been comfortable to express myself like this before, and nor would anyone else I know.Last month, however, Human Rights Watch said: “It’s not real reform in Saudi Arabia if it takes place in a dystopia where rights activists are imprisoned and freedom of expression exists just for those who malign the dissidents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4620dac4a4d81d3fd0d46edcf81071c6d1b3b47/0_55_3651_2190/master/3651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=038ae092d085ecb407c934ac905b24f9","title":"turkey did not make concessions nato summit","story":"Ankara says it made no concessions at Nato summit and that Donald Trump ‘understands’ its positionTurkey made no concessions at this week’s Nato summit and will continue to purchase the Russian S-400 air defence system, the Turkish foreign minister has said.Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu added that the purchase of the Russian system – condemned by France and the US Congress as incompatible with Nato membership – was “perfectly understood” by Donald Trump.Çavuşoğlu said buying the Russian weapon was not politically motivated, but was forced upon Turkey by the refusal of the US and Europe to offer their own defence systems.He continued that Turkey was still open to purchasing the US Patriot missile, and again claimed that European countries, by supporting the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, was backing terrorism.Çavuşoğlu’s remarks underline how the European members of Nato were only able to shelve their disputes with Turkey at the summit.He said the decision to purchase the Russian system came after Turkey spent 10 years trying to buy either the US Patriot missiles, or the European SAMPT missiles, adding that many Nato countries had been withdrawing their air batteries from Turkey, including US, Germany, Netherlands and Italy.Speaking to a conference in Rome on Friday, Çavuşoğlu said: “I wanted to purchase them from our allies, but they refused, and even today I am ready to purchase Patriots, but is the US given any guarantee that they will get consent or the OK from the Congress? No, so I what I am going to do?“It is purely for a technical reason that I had to buy air defence system from somewhere else because I could not get them from my allies. In the future I need more of them and if I cannot get Patriots or SAMPT from our allies I will have to continue to purchasing from other sources. It can be the S-400 or from other sources. President Trump perfectly understands, but the Pentagon does not want to understand this.”He added that France had over-reacted to its incursion into Syria because “they were aiming to create a terrorist state and aiming to support the separatist agenda in Syria”He also suggested that Turkey had not given clearance to publish the Nato plan for the Baltics and Poland until Nato accepted Turkey was right to describe the YPG as terrorists. Turkey had been thought to have dropped its objections at the Nato summit.“Nato currently has two defence plans. One for Turkey, and one for Poland and three Baltic countries,” he said, adding that the alliance had a strict procedure for the passage of such plans through its military committee as well as the Nato Council, before going into effect.He reiterated that the Baltics plan would go to the committee again, then be issued simultaneously with the Turkish plan."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Figures released following unannounced inspections of State\u0026rsquos three special care unitsState is paying for the accommodation while protests prevent 38 asylum seekers moving inPhase one of the national plan is focused on locations in east, midlands and around cities\u0026lsquoThat legislators even considered it without realising the effects makes you wonder\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute respond to 30,000 domestic violence calls every yearMadrid meeting has heard reports of rising emissions and record temperaturesThe male teenager was driving a motorbike when the crash occurred in Cabra3,000 students attend transition year languages eventRuling a positive message for those suffering domestic abuse, Women\u0026rsquos Aid saysPSNI says explosive, discovered in September, part of \u0026lsquocallous attempt\u0026rsquo by New IRA to kill policeCourt could have no confidence something similar would not happen in future \u0026ndash judgeMichael Dineen convicted of Paddy O\u0026rsquoDonnell\u0026rsquos manslaughter but cleared of murderPSNI warns that purchase of puppies from illegal breeders can have \u0026lsquodevasting results\u0026rsquoFrom one former president to another as role is inherited from Mary RobinsonFormer t\u0026aacutenaiste Mary Harney and Joan Freeman among other recipientsINTO wants process to deal with issue in place by spring and gap addressed by summerReport into teenager\u0026rsquos death highlights need for residential addiction services for girlsLauren Cusack says going to Curragh \u0026lsquoa crazy experience\u0026rsquo but she now has \u0026lsquobest job ever\u0026rsquoArrests come following operation targeting Romanian organised crime group"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4107208.1575674060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bingo players express relief as government backs down on prize cap","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEileen Flaherty (91), from Riverstown, Co Sligo, marks her bingo card at St Ronan’s Hall, Keadue, Co Roscommon. Photograph: Brian FarrellBingo caller Oliver McCabe got a huge cheer when he announced that Mai Keaveney, sitting at the back of the hall, was celebrating her 54th wedding anniversary with her husband Johnny. Fifty or so heads swivelled in the direction of Keaveney, nodding their congratulations, some whooping with delight . But there was an even bigger cheer in St Ronan’s Hall, Keadue, Co Roscommon a few minutes later when McCabe, a butcher in the village, announced the Government was “backing down” and there was no threat to bingo.It may now be gospel that there was never going to be any threat to sessions like the one in Keadue, where the prize pot is in the hundreds rather than thousands of euro. The raffle money is collected in a biscuit tin and many of the patrons will tell you they go to as many as five bingo sessions a week to get out of the house. However, many regulars were fearful for a few days that their social network was about to be broken up.The Government’s plan to impose a bingo prize money cap of 50 per cent of proceeds was amended to 75 per cent this week, following interventions from Leitrim TD Martin Kenny and Roscommon-based deputy Denis Naughten.McCabe says the episode shows how “the people at the top” are out of touch. “Many of them never stood in a bingo hall,” he adds. Meanwhile, Rose Deane, Anne Gray and Peggy Whitney meet up a few times a week at bingo sessions in places like Keadue and Drumboylan, Co Roscommon, and Drumshanbo and Carrick-on-Shannon in Co Leitrim. They believe that 60 per cent of regulars at these venues are people who live alone. “It’s a place you don’t mind coming to on your own,” Gray from Leitrim village points out. “It’s better than sitting looking at the four walls. And it’s for two hours so when people get home the night is a lot shorter,” Deane says.Tommy Joe Flaherty (85) from Riverstown, Co Sligo was in his usual spot at the back of the hall in Keadue where he comes every Wednesday night with his sisters Eileen (91) and Margaret (“a lot younger”) . “It’s a night out,” says Flaherty who brings his sisters to bingo five nights across three counties in Drumshanbo (Leitrim) Keadue, Drumboylan, and Boyle, Co Roscommon, as well as Collooney, Co Sligo. “They’d go seven nights if they could,” he says. “It’s not about the money,” he adds, without lifting his head from his card as the numbers are called.Keadue is a small game but Flaherty says they like to support it and have been coming since it started. How long ago was that? “Must be 20 years,” he guesses. “Forty,” corrects caller McCabe.‘Puzzling’He has the heat on and the hall cosy long before the patrons arrive, many of them well stocked with sweets and crisps, like giddy children on a school outing. Some slip out of the hall for a smoke during the breaks. Mary Moran from Keshcarrigan, Co Leitrim and Eileen O’Brien from Gowel, Co Leitrim say they get all the news from McCabe every Wednesday night as he punctuates the games with news of who has got engaged or who passed on in neighbouring parishes. The women are part of a small group of “bingo friends” who have become so close they go away for weekends together. “We have made friends all over the place,” said O’Brien who, like Moran, plays five nights a week.“If they cut the amount we pay out we’d close, simple as that,” says McCabe. “I had to share a tenner between two just now. Can you imagine giving them €2.50 each?”John Comiskey, retired from IT Sligo, volunteers at the weekly bingo sessions in Gillooly Hall, Sligo where about 120 people aged from 18 to 80 gather on Sunday nights. “They come for the banter, although we have had to get more politically correct and we can’t say things like ‘two fat ladies’ any more,” says Comiskey. Prize money is usually €30 for a line and €60 for a full house, he says. “I genuinely don’t think the Government ever meant to target bingo but to think our legislators even considered what they did without realising the consequences for so many people makes you wonder what they are at.”He says it’s puzzling, given how much the Government talks about social isolation. Tea and Kit Kats are the favoured refreshments of patrons in venues like Gillooly Hall, built in 1895 as a temperance hall.One caller said:“Don’t say where I volunteer but I see a lot of people who come to bingo because they are trying to escape other addictions like alcohol.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4107458.1575675667!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"broadband plan first 35 areas to get high speed service are revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe first four areas to be serviced  will be the areas around the cities of Limerick, Kilkenny and Galway, and around Carrigaline, south of Cork city.The first 35 areas to be served with high-speed broadband under the National Broadband Plan have been revealed at a private industry meeting.The locations for the network points, which will be built between now and the end of 2021, are spread across the country, but more are located in the east and the midlands.

An infamous 18-carat lavatory, entitled “America” drew huge crowds when it went on display at New York\u0027s Guggenheim museum in 2016. It was installed at Blenheim Palace in September but stolen just hours later.Despite it being Cattelan\u0027s first contribution to an art fair in 15 years, the gallery appeared taken aback by the popularity of the artist\u0027s latest piece.“It’s a miracle I don’t know how this happened...When we started to work together I had to fight to convince collectors one by one to buy his work,” the gallery\u0027s founder Emmanuel Perrotin told artnet.Emmanuel Perrotin, founder of the Perrotin Gallery poses with Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan piece\u0026#39s \u0026#39Comedian\u0026#39When two editions of the piece promptly sold for $120,000, the vendors decided to offer the third and final piece for $150,000. At least two institutions are reportedly interest in purchasing it.However, potential owners have not been given and advice on what to do if the work begins to decompose. “If the banana moulds, a decision on that will be made on site,” the gallery said.  Entitled Comedian, the artwork is comprised of a banana purchased in a Miami supermarket and held to the wall with a single piece of duct tape. Despite the title of the piece, Perrotin insists the work is not a joke, with everything from the shape of the banana to its placement in the installation given a great deal of consideration. Cattelan himself has offered no direction on how to interpret the work, but MrPerrotin previously told CNN the bananas are a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humour.The installation has fast become one of the most talked-about works at this  year’s Art Basel, with several viewers lining up to take selfies with the  piece.  One passerby was heard declaring the work the best of the show. However  some art fans were less than impressed, with one, Weezie Chandler, telling  local media: “You can do anything and once you’re established you can get  away with it.” The gallery said Cattelan spent a year working on the piece and had originally envisioned a sculpture shaped like a banana.Every time he travelled, he brought a banana with him and hung it in his hotel room to find inspiration. He made several models: first in resin, then in bronze and in painted bronze, the gallery said in a statement.Ultimately, the gallery said, Cattelan decided a real banana was the perfect fit.Donald Trump calls for World Bank to stop lending money to ChinaDonald Trump backs down over plans to designate Mexican cartels as terroristsLabour\u0026#39s leaked NHS files \u0026#39came from Russia\u0026#39, Reddit reveals  Deaf baby girl\u0026#39s joy as new hearing aids are turned onSenior UK diplomat quits, says she will not \u0026#39peddle half-truths\u0026#39 over BrexitComment: Without a leg to stand on, he could not land the blow: our writers\u0026#39 verdict on the BBC election debateBBC election debate: Jeremy Corbyn accused of hypocrisy over his support for the IRA Boris Johnson pledges £550 million for grassroots football in bid to secure 2030 World CupBBC election debate: from Brexit to prisons – how Johnson and Corbyn dealt with the issues \u0026#39The best debate so far\u0026#39 -  readers on the BBC head-to-head Comment: This was Jeremy Corbyn’s last chance to derail Boris Johnson.

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career.

(RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record.

After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time.

In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Only two acts have been announced for next year’s Glastonbury so far, with Paul McCartney confirming his appearance last month (18 November) and Diana Ross confirmed for the festival’s “legends” slot.Taylor Swift is currently tipped to be another of the festival’s headliners next year, with co-organiser Michael Eavis confirming that one of the two headliners left to be announced is a woman.“You would love her to bits – everybody does – but no names at the moment,” he told BBC Somerset.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017.

In Islamic eschatology, Al-Masih ad-Dajjal is an evil figure comparable to the Antichrist – whose name translates to the false messiah, liar, the deceiver in Arabic.\u0026nbspTwitter user @frankoceanhafiz tweeted: Crying @ the fact that Muslims figured out the twist ending of the Netflix \u0027Messiah\u0027 show bc they LITERALLY NAMED THE CHARACTER DAJJAL.In response, one Twitter user wrote: Goes to show you that english speakers also dont look into the meaning or context of the concepts they use - that they borrow these concepts merely because theyre \u0027exotic\u0027 to other english speakers, meant to entertain an audience of english speakers and probs no one else (sic).Messiah\u0026nbsphas received a considerable amount of hype ahead of its release in 2020.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The protest, organised by the climate strike movement Fridays for Future, was also attended by many students, families and professionals.Just a few miles away, in the stuffy surroundings of Madrid’s largest conference centre, negotiators from across the world continued to try to hammer out the final details of the 2015 Paris Agreement.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Thunberg made a surprise appearance at the conference on Friday to meet other young activists before being whisked away by security. She had hitch-hiked her way across the world after the talks were moved from Chile due to civil unrest.Ms Thunberg later told reporters that the voices of climate strikers were being heard but not enough “concrete action” was taking place. Of course there is no victory, because the only thing we want to see is real action,” she said. “So we have achieved a lot, but if you look at it from a certain point of view we have achieved nothing.Created with Sketch.

Speaking at a panel run by the Association of Small Island States, Samoan student Brianna Fruean from 350 Samoa and the Pacific Climate Warriors, said it was critical to remember that some nations represented at the talks were fighting for sheer survival. “World leaders need to know that people like me are watching them.”The key sticking points of the talks, which began on Monday, are how to establish new international rules for carbon markets and how to help poorer countries pay for losses and damage caused by climate change.A decision on carbon market rules is proving tricky because of disagreements about what to do with the surplus credits from earlier emission trading schemes and how to avoid ‘double counting’ emission cuts that are traded overseas.Progress on loss and damage is also a long way off. Many vulnerable nations are pressing for a new financial mechanism to pay for major, one-off disasters such as hurricanes and typhoons, as well as longer term problems exacerbated by climate change.Hillary Clinton says male leaders are ‘scared’ of Greta ThunbergBut influential developed countries, particularly Australia, Japan and Switzerland (as well as the US, which is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement), do not want finance on the table at all because they think it will open the floodgates for future compensation claims.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAnother sensitive subject under discussion is how to ensure human rights are respected in climate action. Russia in particular is resistant to the discussion of human rights in any context.An underlying concern at the talks is the extent to which countries will be expected to be more ambitious when they revise their national carbon-cutting commitments next year.A recent report by UN Environment Programme warned that there was a huge gap between what countries had committed to so far and the goal of keeping global warming to a reasonably safe level. It found global fossil fuel production needs to be more than halved by 2030 to stay within a 1.5c temperature rise, with coal the biggest offender.Pressure to come to an agreement on these issues will rise next week as high-ranking national ministers arrive in Madrid. Whatever they decide will determine the path ahead to the next talks, which will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow next November.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clearly it takes courage to stand before an audience charged with being funny enough to quieten the clink of cutlery.But let’s be frank. He is simply another BBC comedian with acceptable views.BBC-approved comedians dominate the maintained sector of British comedy.Auntie is the superpower of sponsored satire, scattering municence in the direction of any up-and-coming talent with a neat line in attacking approved targets: The patriarchy, Brexit, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Tories, country-sports enthusiasts, royalists and Priti Patel. You get the picture.Of course, not all comedians rely on such sketches. But those that don’t often pay the price.Take talented young comedian Alistair Williams, who shot to prominence off the back of a sketch in which he likened Brexit to being stuck in a Burger King you have voted to leave. His video soon went viral.But as he noted on Twitter the next day: “Because I am a comedian that supports Brexit, you can no longer find me on the comedy club circuit.”There are exceptions. Pro-Brexit comedian Geoff Norcott is gradually finding his way on to a few BBC shows.Simon Evans is a successful comic who parodies his own upper-middle class, right-of-centre viewpoint, while occasionally getting in an anti-leftist dig along the way.But compare that to the roll call of liberal-left comics who pop up on the BBC: Ed Byrne, Dara O Briain, Marcus Brigstocke, Jolyon Rubinstein, Sandi Toksvig, Mitchell and Webb, Mark Steel, Mark Thomas, Jo Brand, Andy Parsons, Russell Howard and Stewart Lee.These and others form a rolling castlist for the BBC’s many radio and TV  and sketch shows, trotting out the same takes to approving titters from audiences apparently bussed in en-masse from North London.A few weeks ago, after enduring a standard Have I Got News For You anti-Brexit fest, I turned over to watch Mock The Week on BBC to see host Dara O Briain tell a list of Malaysian heritage he wouldn’t be welcome in the Brexit Party .I vented about it on Twitter because whatever you think of the Brexit Party, it has been notably erse since its inception. O Briain’s lazy smear made no sense.It quickly transpired the one Malaysian-born person to achieve senior elected office in the UK is Christina Jordan, who is the Brexit Party’s MEP for Gibraltar and the South West.Soon she was giving O Briain an ear-bashing.His retort was that he got a laugh from the studio audience because that was what they thought of the Brexit Party.No wonder, eh Even some of those on the BBC’s roster have clocked that their unormity of outlook might be a problem.Brigstocke spoke in  of the shock of seeing audience members walk out of his show during his anti-Brexit segment when he took it on tour round the country.But comedy as a whole shows few signs of coming to terms with the case for more erse thinking.Most of us not on the Left do not close our minds to the possibility of those we disagree with still being funny.The late Jeremy Hardy’s Tory takedowns on Radio ’s The News Quiz were brilliant.But most comics don’t work hard enough to offer such original material.Jo Brand’s joke about battery acid being thrown over politicians is a case in point.We get she probably doesn’t really wish that on anyone. It is another way for her to say she doesn’t like particular politicians.We knew that.Thankfully, salvation is at hand.An independent sector is sprouting up, taking advantage of social media and hosting free-thinking comedy nights.Lee Hurst, a veteran whose broadcast career was curtailed for not being reliably left-wing, is a patron of the scene.In performers such as Williams, Norcott, Evans and Titania McGrath satirist Andrew Doyle — plus free-wheeling left-wingers such as Francesca Martinez and American Rob Delaney — we see the makings of a new alternative-comedy scene.Seek them out, ditch the BBC and have a laugh.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But when do they start, who is striking and how will it affect the UK  Heres everything you need to know.The national strikes began at pm on December .Strikes are expected to continue over the coming weekend, until December .Some industries strikes, like Eurostar for instance, will protest for longer - Eurostar plans to strike from December  to .However, some trade union bosses have warned they will continue with industrial action until Macron backtracks on his unpopular pension plan.Its thought to be the largest nationwide strike in Frances history.The strikes were agreed by unions unhappy with the Presidents plans for a universal points-based pension system.The basic idea is that employees would earn points for each day worked, which would later turn into pension benefits upon retirement.Currently, Frances pension system is not unied and it means certain professions - like lawyers and opera workers - retire with cushy pensions.Macrons new system aims to recty this but it also means that those retiring before the age of  would lose out.Someone retiring in France at age  under the new scheme would receive five per cent less than someone retiring one year later.Frances current system is one of the most expensive in the world, and taking into account people living much longer these days, costs are only set to increase.But workers on both ends of the scale argue that a singular scheme fails to accommodate for iniduals working lives. workers, for instance, have a long-negotiated early retirement as compensation for the gruelling work, long hours and endless shts spent underground.Thousands of workers from all sectors are thought to be striking.Those taking industrial action are:Frances interior minister predicted on the evening the strike commenced some  demonstrations - but official numbers are yet to be released.He said: We know there will be lots of people in these protests and we know the risks. I have requested that systematically when there is rioting or violence we make arrests immediately.The strikes could affect thousands of Brits as EasyJet, British Airways, Ryanair and Eurostar cancel numerous services.When the French Air Traffic Controllers went on strike earlier in , over  flights had to be cancelled.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office warned of severe delays that could affect trains, metros, busses and trams across France.Brits heading to France should therefore check before they travel to make sure services are still running.Brits heading to France next week should therefore check before they travel to make sure services are still running.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have accepted the result and I support Boris’s deal. The country must move on.It is fundamental to democracy that we implement the will of the people. Yet too many MPs have forgotten they promised to abide by the people’s decision.They spent three years trying to frustrate the result. Now they want to waste the next five doing the same.Every time one of the ultra-Remainers’ spurious claims is defeated, they invent another.They said Boris could not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and Brussels would not budge. Boris stood his ground and proved them wrong.Now they say we will face a new clf-edge No Deal at the end of next year unless a trade deal is completed with the EU.But there is no comparison with what faced us before. We will have left the EU by then.Two big concerns — citizens’ rights and Northern Ireland — will have been dealt with.It is true that time will be tight. For that we can blame the MPs who did everything in their power to delay our exit.But Boris has proved he is an effective negotiator. Both sides want a trade deal and our economies are already aligned, making agreement easier.With a working majority, Boris’s hand will be stronger and the job will be done. Ultra-Remainers have conjured up this new No Deal spectre because they are desperate.They know thatBoris wins the General Election, we will leave the EU by the end of January and the game will be up.Their second referendum campaign is in tatters and the Liberal Democrats’ pledge to revoke Brexit has bombed.The clock is counting down to an election that could settle the issue once and for all. So they are resorting to ever-more ludicrous claims.So-called moderates should be ashamed of the insults they are hurling at Boris.It is absurd to call his agenda “far-right” or “extreme”.This language should be reserved to describe hateful movements such as the BNP or the National Front.It should not be casually thrown around by fools who have been so blinded by their hatred of Brexit they have lost all sense of proportion.Boris was a successful Mayor of London who won a second term and delivered for the public.His plans to boost funding for schools and the NHS, for more police and to increase the National Living Wage, are clearly mainstream.When Boris calls for tougher sentences for violent criminals, he is speaking squarely for the millions of quiet Brits who share these views.They hate being branded as extremists by metropolitan elitists who have lost touch with everyday concerns.Liberal Conservatives like me are entirely comfortable supporting today’s party.I have marched alongside Boris for gay rights. I have heard him speak passionately about protecting the environment. I have walked down streets and seen him connect with people like no other politician can.I cannot understand how anyone who previously called themselves a Conservative could bring themselves to urge people to vote against the party at this election.That is tantamount to saying Jeremy Corbyn should be PM.These Tory turncoats justy themselves by claiming Brexit will damage the economy. But the public rejected that argument when they voted for Brexit.And you can’t warn about jobs and investment while being willing to allow the catastrophic impact of a government led by Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.Never in my letime have I seen an agenda like Labour’s today: Ruinous nationalisation spending pledges the country cannot begin to pay for theof crushing union power a leader who has consistently sided with our country’s enemies and who refuses to tackle endemic racism in his own party.This isn’t the loony left. It is the lethal left.It is a blood-red recipe to crash the economy, impoverish our public services and relegate Britain to a third-rate power.No moderate should even consider supporting it. One by one, former Labour MPs are calling out Corbyn, warning us of the dangers.Why can’t the ultra-Remainer former Tory MPs and muddled old warhorses like Lord Heseltine, who once understood the threat of socialism, see it Blinded by their hatred of Brexit, they say the election offers a Hobson’s choice between two extremes.That is hogwash. There is no equivalence between Corbyn’s hard-left programme and Boris’ mainstream Conservative agenda.Evenyou want the referendum result reversed, which most people do not, a neo-Marxist in No cannot be a price worth paying.It is time for those who call themselves moderates to wake up and realise the truly extreme step would be to help make Corbyn PM next week.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do not allow history to become a deafening silence.

But how can you not have a table How do you eat  Where do you have coffee  What do you put your shopping on when you come home  And where do you sityou want to read something  Which brings me on to another astonishing fact. Today, in Britain, , children do not own a single book.Obviously, I’m aware that children would much rather shoot an alien in the face than read some drivel by Jane Austen. And I get that. I’d rather gouge my own eyes out with a trowel than read anything by Jane Austen. And I’d certainly rather play Call Of Duty.I’ll admit, too, that book people spend far too much time being bookish and earnest with other book people. Which is why the book that wins the Booker Prize is always more impenetrable than a Hawthorn bush.It’s usually just a lot of women wondering about flowers. Have I read either of this year’s joint winners  No. I’d rather eat my own sick. But the idea of living in a house with no books at all is actually quite frightening.Because then there’d be no Winnie The Pooh, and more worryingly, no Jack Reacher.They’ve tried to capture the essence of this man mountain on television and, hilariously, with Tom Cruise in the role at the cinema, but nothing beats the books. They’re all the same. Jack walks into a small town in America. He has some coffee. Notices a pretty girl. Punches eight men in the face. Sleeps with the pretty girl. Saves the town from the baddies by punching them all in the face and then walks off at the end.I swear to God thatyou could get your kids to put down their phones for a day, and read a Jack Reacher book, they’d never want to do social media again. I know that’s impossible. I know you can’t get a kid to put down its phone for more than  seconds. I’m just saying thatyou could . . .So what about school  Kids are made to read by teachers, but the books they select are always as dull as being dead. Andyou make kids read boring books for exams, they will grow up to hate reading.So ditch Austen and Donne and Shakespeare and Milton. Put them on the top shelf of a library and leave them there. Instead, to make reading fun, make them study Jack Reacher and books by Jilly Cooper and Jeffrey Archer.Even EL Jamesthat’s what it takes. Anything that gets them reading. Anything that makes books cool. It won’t work for everyone of course. Some kids will not enjoy a book no matter how good the story might be.But that’s OK. They can go off and do carpentry instead. Then they could make the family a table.APPARENTLY,  people complained about a raunchy appearance by the Pussycat Dolls on last weekend’s X Factor final.Some say the performance was “shameful” while others said the “strip show” was “absolutely disgraceful”.I couldn’t agree more. We sat through a rubbish song and at the end, they were wearing exactly the same amount of clothing as they had been at the start.But almost all of them these days are NEVER seen in public without a phone in one hand and . . . a plastic bottle of water in the other.I don’t know when it became compulsory to have water about your person at all times, but it’s stupid.Yes. You need wateryou are in the desert and you’re hundreds of miles from a tap and it’s C.But at all other times, you should drink beer.Because that comes in a glass bottle that doesn’t end up wrapped round some poor unfortunate sea creature’s head.AFTER about three hours my back bottom went to sleep but the rest of me was still gripped by Martin Scorsese’s new epic, The Irishman.Mostly, however, I was gripped by how badly the phenomenally expensive de-ageing technology works.It’s used in flash- backs to turn ageing stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino into younger men but it makes them look like Bill and Ben.And their plastic faces are at odds with their elderly bodies.Pity.

They spelled “impressionable” wrong.

That’s not true this time: it is the MOST IMPORTANT VOTE in our letimes.At stake is whether we leave the EU or not. You may think that was settled by the Brexit referendum — and it should have been. But any result other than a Tory majority will lead to more efforts to overturn the referendum result.It will mean another year when politicians argue about whether to accept what people voted for in June , rather than focusing on schools, hospitals and all the other domestic issues that matter so much.There are TWO POSSIBLE RESULTS in this election: a Tory majority or another hung Parliament. Even John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, is talking about how Labour would try to governit didn’t have a majority.Another hung Parliament would be more of the same: Parliamentary gridlock and no progress. What would a Parliament without a majority for any party be able to agree on beyond a second referendum It is not even certain it could do that. You would need a government for a second referendum and Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said she would rather have another election than put either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn into No.So we may well all be heading to the polls AGAIN in Februarythere is no clear result this time. Eventhey could unite on a second referendum, they wouldn’t be able to agree on much . It would be a single-issue government, to the detriment of everything .When Labour make extravagant promises it has a double credibility problem. First, how will it pay for them  It is not realistic to say you can fund spending equivalent to half an NHS every year just by taxing the rich and big business a bit more.Second, will they actually happen given that Labour won’t win a majority  In a hung Parliament, Labour will only be able to do those things that Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats agree to.By contrast, a Tory majority government would not be more of the same. It would break the Brexit deadlock. This country would leave on January . This will not settle the question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it will mean that Brexit won’t continue to suck up all of Parliament’s energies.A majority government is also more easily held to account. If the Tories win one, then at the next election voters will be able to seethey have delivered on what they said that would do: There will  be no excuses and no hiding places. Right now, the Tories are on course for a majority. I understand their own internal numbers indicate a working majority.But these margins are very fine, and victory could slip awayvoters don’t turn out. If Boris Johnson does win a majority next week, it will be because he has presented himself as change. Not just the person who can break the deadlock, but a leader with a dferent agenda to the one the Tories have had these past nine years.As Prime Minister of a majority government, he would have to deliver on that agenda. He would have to create the conditions for the economy to flourish far outside London and the South East, he would have to improve the NHS and our infrastructure.Having been elected as a dferent kind of Tory, he will have to govern as that. This country has been in limbo for too long. It needs a Parliament that can take decisions, not just play for time.According to one campaign source: “There is still a nervousness about letting it run wild.”But there is a recognition that the Tories  need a bit of pizzazz in the last few days and that Boris  needs, “the energy of a walkabout”.The Tory plan is to “close hard”. They are, privately, cautiously optimistic.One Cabinet minister says: “In  you could feel it slipping away, it doesn’t feel like that this time.”But they have held back nearly all their online advertising budget for the last few days to guard against any last-minute swing back to Labour.FEW expected Donald Trump to be able to resist getting involved in the election on his visit here for the Nato summit.But in the end, Trump, largely, kept his views to himself.I understand that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was key in persuading him not to derail Boris Johnson’s election effort.Kushner, who has a leading role at the White House, developed a good relationship with Johnson when the latter was Foreign Secretary and was keen not to have the visit create any distractions.If he doesn’t, we will  have a second referendum where voters will be asked to choose between Remain and Remain-lite. Nigel Farage is badly miscalculating in his refusal to tell voters in Labour Tory marginals to back the Tories.If Labour hold on in seats such as High Peak in Derbys, it will be because of the Brexit Party standing in a seat that it has no chance of winning.One veteran Eurosceptic who has been part of an effort to get the Brexit Party to make clear that voters shouldn’t back it where it has no chance of winning blames Richard Tice, the Brexit Party chair and its candidate in Hartlepool, for blocking any such move.This source tells me Tice is “a nightmare, he is a far bigger problem than Farage”.This election is going to come down to fine margins. The Brexit Party vote could well let Labour hang on in some crucial seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Moments when things come together — or when they fall apart.Moments that define history and set the course of the future.We all remember Gareth Southgate’s heartfelt celebrations last summer and that Eric Dier penalty.We slightly overlook how close the keeper was to saving it. Thankfully he didn’t and we put years of penalty heartbreak behind us.In politics, one of those moments is coming next Thursday.We can either deliver Brexit and move forward with a Conservative majority Government, or we can have more Brexit delay, more arguing in Parliament, and two more referendums in  under Jeremy Corbyn. Next Thursday, I’m asking many dferent people to come on a journey with me. People who always vote Conservative. People who used to but lost faith. People who never have before.All of you who do are putting your trust in me. And I don’t take that lightly at all. Yet I feel so positive about our future as a country outside the EU. There’s so much we can achieve as well as lots we need to improve too.It won’t always be easy. We won’t always agree.

They have three sons together.He was married to his first we, academic Jane Chapman, from  to .Corbyn spent most of his -year career as an MP as an obscure backbencher.But in a remarkable turn of events the bearded throwback leftie was propelled from the political fringe to leading the UKs main opposition party.Ed Miliband, who lost the General Election against the odds in , decided to open up future leadership contests to the public for a £ fee.But instead of drawing in a wide spectrum of society, the opportunity to vote was seized by a hard left faction which later became known as Momentum.And so with their support the crumpled maverick won the votes.Corbyn’s low-fi style in contrast to other polished politicians also won him support from young people looking for a no-frills socialist leader.His leadership was then challenged in  after his lacklustre support for the Remain camp in the Brexit vote.After a no-confidence vote was supported by  Labour MPs to  against, a leadership battle began between Corbyn and Welsh MP Owen Smith.But after Momentum marshalled support for him, Corbyn actually increased his leadership from . per cent to . per cent.However, after just four years doing the job it was rumoured he was tired and fed up.Allies have reportedly claimed hell soon hand over to another MP.One Shadow Cabinet member told the Evening Standard: Corbyn is ready to step down.

The Prime Minister accused Mr Corbyn of a failure of leadership in his handling of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.The Labour leader shot back that he never used racist language and that he hoped Mr Johnson regretted his past comments. Viewers of the BBC TV debate believe the Prime Minister narrowly won although it was within the polling margin of error so is effectively too close to call. According to a YouGov snap poll % believe Mr Johnson won and % think Mr Corbyn did. The pollster said this falls within the margin of error so it can be considered another draw. Those who answered donapost know have been removed from results.Chris Curtis, YouGovaposs political research manager, said: Our snap poll shows that the public remains ided on who won the debate, just as with last monthaposs head-to-head, with most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won, and very few people changing their minds.But given the Conservatives went into this debate in the lead, they will hope the lack of a knockout blow means they can maintain this until voting day. Boris Johnson had a toe-curling response when asked what the punishment should be for politicians who lie. The Prime Minister has been accused of misleading the country on a number of issues including his promises to create , nurse places - , of whom are already working in the service, his promise for  hospitals which transpired as only six and the infamous message on the side of the Vote Leave bus.  At the BBCaposs leadersapos debate in Maidstone, Kent, a member of the audience asked the two leaders what punishment they think is appropriate for elected politicians who lie during political campaigns  The audience laughed at Mr Johnson as he smirked and said politicians who lie during election campaigns should be made to go on their knees down on their knees through the chamber of the House of Commons scourging themselves with copies of their offending documents which claim to prove one thing and actually prove something quite dferent.  One audience member shouted out: Go on then.  Jeremy Corbyn hit back at Boris Johnsonaposs claims that the NHS is not on the table in future trade deals with the US.  During the leadership debate the Labour leader was challenged on his assertion thatthere was a deal with America then Brits would face five-figure bills for cancer treatment.  Mr Corbyn asked the Prime Minister why negotiations had taken two yearsMr Johnson was telling the US that the NHS was not for sale. He said: The Prime Minister says heaposs not going to do that kind of trade deal. If thataposs the case, why did the talks go on for two years  It doesnapost take two years to say no to privatisation of the NHS.  The Labour leader clashed with the Prime Minister during the BBCaposs head-to-head debate less than a week before the election. Host Nick Robinson asked: You donapost dispute what heaposs quoted which is that American trade negotiators say they want more access to the NHS.  He replied: Iaposve made it absolutely clear to everybody that under no circumstances will that happen. Mr Robinson asked Mr Corbyn: You sent an email on behalf of the Labour Party saying aposimagine opening a five figure bill for your cancer treatmentapos, do you accept that is totally misleading - thereaposs no possibility of anybody having NHS cancer treatments and having to pay a five figure bill.  Mr Corbyn replied: If you end up with a privatised service, thataposs what you get. If you end up with a US trade deal, thataposs what you get. Mr Johnson said: This is pure Bermuda Triangle stuff. Weaposve heard it time and time again from the Labour Party during this election campaign. Weaposll be hearing about aposlittle green menapos next.  Mr Johnson added: Under no circumstances will we sell it off to anybody in any kind of trade deal. The PM added that he has made it absolutely clear to everybody that under no circumstances will it happen.  Boris Johnson was once again skewered on his bogus pledge to have  new hospitals . But when a nurse asked about dealing with the shortage of staff, it was actually Jeremy Corbyn who shed some new light on policy. Under pressure from BBC host Nick Robinson, Mr Corbyn confirmed Labouraposs ambition to reach a -hour week within a decade was not a hard plan to apply to NHS staff. Mr Corbyn said he wants to see the working week come down, but added: There is no plan to bring in a four day week in the NHS. This appears to contradict Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell who said last month: It’s a -hour week implemented over a ten-year period – it will apply to everyone.  Jeremy Corbynaposs damning attack on the failings of Capitalism  Jeremy Corbyn found himself on stronger ground when talking about capitalism and its failings. After Boris Johnson accused him and his allies of wanting to overthrow capitalism he replied: “My plan is one where you don’t leave people behind. “You don’t ignore the fact that million of our children are living in poverty, you don’t ignore the fact there are thousands of people sleeping on the streets of this country - the fth richest country in the world. The inequality has got worse.  billionaires in Britain, more people poor than ever.” The audience applauded. He added: “We’ve gone too far down the road of free market economics… we’ve created too much inequality.”  Boris Johnson confronted over politicising Jack Merrittaposs death  When the leaders were asked about balancing the needs of security against human rights against in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack, Mr Corbyn said: What happened on the streets of London was utterly appalling and I very moved by what Jack Merrittaposs father said about what his son was trying to do. Mr Johnson had threatened to lock up terrorists and throw away the key - even though victim Jack Merritt’s dad had pleaded for him not to politicise the atrocity.Mr Corbyn slammed the Tory leader: “Yes of course you must imprison them. Yes of course you must try and rehabilitate themyou can.  “But there has to be a monitoring process to achieve that. We need security on our streets. Security doesn’t come on the cheap.   “Andyou cut the number of police officers, cut the number of PCSOs, privatise the probation service, underfund all the other aspects of the criminal justice system, then we all pay a price with our own security.”   Mr Johnson claimed he was putting a huge amount of money into the criminal justice system - even though the Tories have cut expenditure on justice by %, and have announced no plans to increase expenditure except on prisons.

The pair faced off in an hour-long challenge on the BBC over terror, tax, the NHS and their plans for spending.As usual Boris Johnson made a string of claims about both Labouraposs claims and his own. But as usual, not all of those claims were in fact true.From Labouraposs tax plans to the partyaposs record on security, Mr Johnson trotted out a string of claims which just donapost entirely stand up to scrutiny.Weaposve debunked his usual whoppers about , more nurses and  new hospitals before - you can read our explanations here. But here are six new claims he made that left us scratching our heads. On Labouraposs tax plans  WHAT HE SAID: I think itaposs quite incredible that Mr Corbyn should claim that people on £, a year are amongst the richest in society and therefore deserve to be clobbered by his tax increases.THE FACTS:Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to raise Income Tax only on people who earn more than £,, not £,. Itaposs true that the IFS think tank has said that, in or order to afford Labouraposs spending plans, at some point lower earners will be affected in some way. But itaposs not clear where this £, figure has come from - and £k earners are in the top % of income tax payers in the UK.  WHAT HE SAID: Heaposs proposing to put in a Home Secretary in the form of Diane Abbott whoaposs called for MI to be disbanded.THE FACTS: Diane Abbott signed an Early Day Motion calling for the abolition of MI in , but said more than two years ago that her views had changed. She said in May : At that time I and a lot of people felt MI needed reforming. It has since been reformed and of course I would not call for its abolition now. On a Brexit deal being ready to go WHAT HE SAID: Asked aposyou donapost know you could do a trade deal with the EUapos, he replied: On the contrary, we have a fantastic deal. It is there, ready to go.THE FACTS: The deal Boris Johnson has aposready to goapos is a withdrawal, not a trade deal. The latter is much tougher - one between the EU and Canada took seven years - andwe donapost get it by the end of December , weaposll still leave the EU with no deal.On getting Brexit out of Parliament  WHAT HE SAID: The great beauty of this deal is it gets Brexit done, gets it out of Parliament, stops the wrangling, stops the chaos and moves us forward.THE FACTS: In February  the government promised a role for Parliament in scrutinising future Free Trade Agreements to be struck around the world after Brexit. That suggests Brexit will be discussed in Parliament for many more years to come. On the case of Usman Khan  WHAT HE SAID: There was no parole or probation involved in this. He was released automatically and there was nothing any parole or probation officer could do about that. That was the nature of the sentence.THE FACTS: While itaposs true Usman Khan was released automatically without a parole hearing - which tragically allowed him free to kill, and is something that wouldnapost happenheaposd been given the same sentence under current rules - the Press Association reports there would have been some probation service involvement. As a PA explainer put it: Khan’s sentence was an extended sentence, meaning he would have to spend an extra five years on licence after he was freed from prison. This meant he would have been supervised by the probation service for the  years after his release.On bringing back the nursesapos bursary WHAT HE SAID: Weaposre bringing back the £, bursary.THE FACTS: Launching the Tory manesto, Boris Johnson vowed to give nurses a £, to £, a year maintenance grant. But this doesnapost bring back the old system. Unlike under the original bursary scheme - which the Tories scrapped in  - nurses in training will still have to pay tuition fees on their courses.WHAT HE SAID: Delaying Brexit is costing this country an extra billion pounds a month.THE FACTS: This cost is only when compared to a no-deal Brexit, in which the UK refuses to pay any orce bill. WHAT HE SAID: Labour would wreck this economy with a £.trillion spending splurge.THE FACTS: The £.tn estimate wrongly claims a four-day week would begin on Day One, and counts disputed estimates and conference policies unlikely to be in Labouraposs manesto. WHAT HE SAID: Parliament first voted to approve this deal, and then voted for delay.THE FACTS: Parliament did not vote to approve the PM’s Brexit deal - MPs only passed it through its first Commons hurdle in principle before crucial amendments. WHAT HE SAID: Corbyn would spend the whole of  having two referendums. One on Scotland.THE FACTS: Jeremy Corbyn has said he would not allow a referendum on Scottish independence in . WHAT HE SAID: Health spending boost is the biggest increase in modern memory in the NHS.THE FACTS: The IFS says the Toriesapos rise is .% a year in real terms. Under the last Labour government it was .% before dropping to .% between   and  . WHAT HE SAID: The Labour party have a policy of zero control on immigration.THE FACTS: Members voted at Labouraposs conference to remove several controls, but not all controls, and it is thought the policy did not survive intact into the manesto. WHAT HE SAID: Jeremy Corbyn would whack Corporation Tax straight back up to the highest levels in Europe.THE FACTS: Labouraposs previous pledges to restore Corporation Tax to % would still be lower than France , Portugal , Germany , Belgium , Greeceand Italy , according to the OECD. WHAT HE SAID: This government has put far more into flood defences than the previous Labour government.THE FACTS: While the annual figure is now higher than under Labour, spending plunged under the first three full years of the Tories from  . WHAT HE SAID: London murder rate was fewer than  for several years running when he was mayorTHE FACTS: Official figures compiled by the BBC show there was only one year in Boris Johnsonaposs eight as mayor where the homicide rate dropped below .

He put in a good sht in the final head-to-head with the blue blustering bumbler, Johnson a fork-tongued incompetent charlatan with his “One Nation Tory” pitch as hollow as his “Get Britain Done” moronic mantra. Corbyn both looked and sounded more relaxed than during the first bout a fortnight ago with Labour strategists desperately hoping voters will prefer his inclusive decency to another dose of Johnsonaposs le-sapping Tory austerity. Kudos to Corbyn for hammering Johnson and the Conservativesapos abysmal record over the past nine years on health, nursing, social care, police cuts and probation privatisation. Kudos too for stating thereaposs no conflict between protecting us against terrorists, murderers and rapists and respecting our human rights. Treating Johnson with contempt, particularly over the NHS and Brexit and his racism, cut the -stone Tory down to size including a dig at his £m untrustworthiness.

There, I’ve admitted my guilty tactical secret. I feel dirty, temporarily backing a party in the awful ConDem coalition four years ago. And sad as a Leftie excited by Labour’s radical programme who’d love to see Corbyn in No . Yet it’s my best way to see that rather than voting for the party I really want. Labour marooned , behind hasn’t a cat in hell’s chance of winning in London’s Richmond Park and North Kingston where I live. Lib Dem Sarah Olney needs only several dozen of Labour’s , voters holding their noses to overturn Zac Goldsmith’s wafer-thin  majority and Boris Johnson’s lost a seat. So I’ll do my bit for the democratic socialist revolution by helping deprive Johnson of a Tory majority, hopefully opening Downing Street’s gates to Red Jezza. Lib Dems must do the same by voting Labour in Labour constituencies or areas where Labour’s secondthey wish to stop Brexit.  Without tactical voting Labour, Libs, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru destroy each other when an anti-Tory alliance is needed.

So itaposs only natural that pollsters YouGov ran a snap poll of viewers on who they thought won. As you could probably have guessed, the result sums up the utter stasis of our politics in the most depressing way possible. Excluding donapost knows, Johnson won % of viewersapos votes while Corbyn won % - the same split as the Brexit Remain vote three and a half years ago. YouGov said that, as this falls within the margin of error, it can be considered another draw.% said Johnson was more likeable compared to % for Corbyn. % said Johnson performed better on Brexit with % picking Corbyn.And % said Johnson was better on security compared to % on Corbyn. But there was a major upside for Labour backers as % said Corbyn came across as more trustworthy - compared to just % backing Johnson. And a whopping % of those polled said Corbyn performed better on the NHS, compared to just % picking Johnson - who was picked apart over his dodgy pledges for more nurses and hospitals. YouGov polled , viewers during the debate.Chris Curtis, YouGov’s Political Research Manager, said: “Our snap poll shows that the public remains ided on who won the debate, just as with last monthaposs head-to-head. With most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won, and very few people changing their minds. But given the Conservatives went into this debate in the lead, they will hope the lack of a knockout blow means they can maintain this until voting day. BBC host Nick Robinson oversaw only the second - but final - head-to-head debate of the  general election campaign between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn . After telling a string of half-truths himself, Boris Johnson gave a cringeworthy response to one of the  audience members who asked what should happen to politicians who lie during an election. As audience members laughed he stuttered that they should be made to go on their knees through the chamber of the House of Commons, scourging themselves with copies of their offending documents. But one audience member heckled: Go on then! Go on then! With less than a week to polling day, Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson of a failure of leadership for using racist remarks adding: I hope the Prime Minister understands the hurt people feel. And he said: Don’t ignore the fact that million of our children are living in poverty - the inequality has got worse. The Labour leader warned of chaos and huge job lossesa Tory government was unable to get a free trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.  And he urged the Prime Minister to listen to the message of the father of murdered Jack Merritt - who warned him not to politicise the London Bridge attack to push through harsher sentences. When the leaders were asked about balancing the needs of security against human rights against in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack, Mr Corbyn said: What happened on the streets of London was utterly appalling and I very moved by what Jack Merrittaposs father said about what his son was trying to do. That he wanted a society where you did address the huge problems where somebody committed awful acts, of course, you must imprison them of course you try and rehabilitate themyou can. Mr Johnson said: I have huge sympathy for Mr Merritt and the ... families of both victims and it was an absolutely terrible thing. But I still think itaposs wrong that someone like Usman Khan who was sentenced  years or  years plus five on licence should have been out automatically on eight years. Elsewhere, Jeremy Corbyn hit back at Boris Johnsonaposs claims that the NHS is not on the table in future trade deals with the US. During the leadership debate the Labour leader was challenged on his assertion thatthere was a deal with America then Brits would face five-figure bills for cancer treatment. Mr Corbyn asked the Prime Minister why negotiations had taken two yearsMr Johnson was telling the US that the NHS was not for sale. He said: The Prime Minister says heaposs not going to do that kind of trade deal. If thataposs the case, why did the talks go on for two years  It doesnapost take two years to say no to privatisation of the NHS.  The hour-long clash came after a torrid day for the Prime Minister as former PM John Major told voters to back Independents over the Tories in the election. Tony Blair declared thank God for John Major! at an anti- Brexit rally tonight as a video message from Sir John said next weekaposs vote is the final chance to affect Brexit. During the debate Mr Johnson said he would not condemn Sir John as a “has-been” but added: “Unlike Mr Major I lead a party that is now totally united.” Host Nick Robinson shot back: “Totally united because you got rid of everybody you didn’t agree with!” Mr Johnson insisted all of his candidates backed his Brexit deal. But Jeremy Corbyn said it would take seven years for Mr Johnson to negotiate a trade deal adding: “What he will do is walk out of a relationship with the EU into a relationship with nobody.” Meanwhile the PM was left reeling after BBC interviewer Andrew Neil lambasted him for refusing to be grilled by the him on primetime TV. Mr Johnson pulled out of a visit to a pub in Kent after protesters turned up and he was branded a chicken. Jeremy Corbyn went on the attack, unleashing a fresh set of documents which he claimed shattered Mr Johnsonaposs pledge there will be no checks on goods going to Northern Ireland. In the debate Boris Johnson tried to turn the tables on Jeremy Corbyn - saying it was slightly curious…to be lectured about the union by a man who “supported for four decades the IRA”. But Jeremy Corbyn shot back: How about the Prime Minister showing a degree of honesty about the arrangements he’s actually made with Northern Ireland  We now know there are restrictions. He should and could have said it at the time.  Boris Johnsonaposs claims he would get Brexit done by January were unpicked by Nick Robinson as the host pointed out he would only get out - not negotiate a trade deal. Mr Johnson claimed there was ample time to get a trade deal in  months despite a similar deal between the EU and Canada taking seven years. Jeremy Corbyn ran into his own problems however as, quizzed by an audience member, he did not guarantee Brexit would happen next year. Instead, asked directly, he said: “What I can guarantee is we’ll bring an end to this debate and have a final say for the people of this country.” And he restated Labouraposs pledge to negotiate a new deal within three months and a referendum between it and Remain in six months.

Four-month-old Georgina Addison was born deaf and had two hearing aids fitted when she was just a few weeks old, Wales Online reports. Every morning when her parents Paul and Louise go to wake her up, they switch on her hearing aids and watch as she shows her happiness. In the footage, little Georgina can be seen smiling and laughing when she hears her mumaposs voice after the aids are switched on. Her father, a communication manager from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said it “fills his heart with joy” every time he turns on Georgina’s hearing aids each morning. He said: It’s like she’s having the lights switched on and she can hear her mum’s voice. “She is instantly delighted and becomes much happier straight away. “Her face lights up and she looks delighted. “For us as parents it is a true delight for us too.  “It fills my heart with joy and you just can’t put a price on things like this. “Every morning she reacts like it’s a completely new experience and that will never get old.” Paul and HR manager, Louise, discovered first-born Georgina was deaf shortly after she was born in August. Initial audiology tests identied hearing issues and the family were referred to see a specialist audiologist.  Paul said: “Getting that sort of news is always going to be dficult. “We focused on the practicalities of the situation and did our best to stay positive. She got her hearing aids in September and the couple recorded the video yesterday.

Traffic was backed up with at least  miles of queues and carnage will continue throughout tonight with normal traffic conditions not forecast until am. The huge crane smashed down over both sides of the carriageway after the serious crash at Junction  with the M in Essex at around .pm today. Earlier, delays were forecast until pm.Traffic has improved signicantly but Highways England warns conditions will notto normal for some time. At .pm tonight Highways England reported: The event is expected to clear between am and .am tomorrow . Normal traffic conditions are expected between am and .am on December . This is causing miles of slow-moving queues on the M, too, between junctions  and  on the northbound carriageway. Dismayed commuters trying to get home are being warned of the severe delays and being urged to find alternative routes.  Highways England tweeted this afternoon: M at J clockwise and anti-clockwise, motorway is CLOSED for a serious Road traffic collision involving a vehicle that has crossed over. All emergency services heading to scene. Please avoid the area.  Journey times were being increased by at least  minutes or more and at pm they were still being delayed by an hour.The crane overturned and crossed from the clockwise to the anticlockwise carriage way between the slip roads. There were  miles of queues on the clockwise carriageway almost reaching Potters Bar. Meanwhile on the anticlockwise, the traffic stretched back past Brentwood.  Essex Police asked drivers to remain patient. In a tweet they urged motorists to consider the safety of officers and other road workers. “Please remind people to remain patient and not put officers or other highway workers at risk by turning or moving unless or until directed by Police. We are making good progress and will get everyone out, they said. They confirmed that no-one has been seriously hurt. Twitter user Grant Maton said at pm: Just had the pleasure of spending    hours on #M for what is usually a  minute run! The motorway was completely closed and traffic was stationary. There has also been an oil spillage from the accident, which was expected to take some time to clear. A video showed serious damage to the central reservation and appeared to show several severely damaged vehicles. Six fire crews were said to have been on scene dealing with the overturned crane. Several blocks from the carriageway were broken off by the crane and spread across the junction making it impossible for cars to pass. Photos, which were tweeted by the Essex Roads Policing Unit - South team, showed a huge hole in the concrete central reservation.  At pm, Essex Police said that specialist contractors were required to help with recovering the wreckage and debris from the crash. They said: “Highways England teams worked hard together with the emergency services to release the earlier trapped traffic from the scene. “Specialist contractors will be required to recover the vehicle. “The road is likely to remain closed for some time whilst this work continues and will re-open as soon as it is safe to do so.”  Diversion detailsAnti-clockwise - Road users are advised to follow the hollow black square ersion symbol on road signs Exit the M at J and take the st exit onto A towards London.

Now the -year-old has revealed how devastating depression led to her being passed from pillar to post, struggling to feed her son and left at the mercy of the brutal Universal Credit system. Rachel said: My depression got really bad and I wasnapost getting the help I needed. I didnapost get out of the house for three months. I just sat in my bedroom and it just escalated.  Thereaposs a lack of support, getting a doctoraposs appointment was dficult. You just get passed from pillar to post, from council to crisis team, to doctor.  And that gets you even more depressed. You keep telling people your situation and repeating yourself, and getting nowhere. Are you a struggling parent   Email webnews@mirror with your story Rachel is from Grimsby, where one in four residents are on low incomes and one in two children grow up in poverty. Universal Credit, which was introduced in  by the Tories, has made it a lot harder, Rachel says. She said: They should never have brought it in, itaposs the worst thing they did. Thereaposs that many people struggling on it. You are getting paid once a month,something happens in the middle of the month, you are in trouble. Itaposs harder to budget.    When it was fortnightly, you didnapost struggle so much or worry so much, you can budget for two weeks at a push, but not monthly. In another cruel blow, Rachel is being punished for missing a job seekeraposs appointment which she was unaware of as she does not have a phone or an internet connection. This led to her Universal Credit being sanctioned and a large amount being taken from her payment. This is why, when the television cameras came to her temporary home, she only had p to her name after enduring a particularly hard month. Iaposm struggling with myself, Rachel says.

Her son Bradley is  this month and Rachel says heaposs the only thing keeping her going, the only thing she has to live for. As long as my son is eating, I can manage, she says. Heaposs a growing boy, heaposs at college four days a week so my main priority is making sure heaposs fed, heaposs happy - and looking for a permanent house.But with her next Universal Credit payment coming just five days before Christmas - on the th - she hasnapost yet been able to buy her son a Christmas card yet, which she said hurts but itaposs good that heaposs old enough to understand. Rachel says she sees a lot more people struggling now, compared to five or  years ago.  Everyone says they canapost help you, so they pass you on to everybody , said Rachel.  Sometimes it feels like you donapost have a voice. Youaposre on Universal Credit so you dont have a voice, or youaposre homeless so you donapost have a voice.  Weaposre still human beings at the end of the day. Since Rachelaposs plight was highlighted in the Mirror, Grimsby Live and the BBC, people have come forward with offers of help for the desperate mum.One person has even offered to provide her with a place to stay other than the homeless accommodation she finds herself and her son in. Rachel said: Iaposm a bit overwhelmed, itaposs amazing. Itaposs blown me away how many people want to help. But I didnapost do this for that, I just wanted to get it out there I didnapost expect any of it. It was just to make people aware of how bad it is in Grimsby. Itaposs not just about myself.  Pam Hodge runs the The Rock Foundation Food Bank, based in the former Holme Hill School, and said you can make a donation to the foodbank and state that it is for Rachel. Sheaposs going to need everything for the home such as furniture, a cooker, a bed, electrical appliances - you name it, she said. If they give her money it could affect her benefits. Sheaposs been overwhelmed by the generosity and is keen for it go to help other people as well. People have been very generous, and itaposs raising awareness of whataposs going on in Grimsby, Rachel is just one of many. If you make a donation to the foodbank then everyone can have a good Christmas.  Pam said Grimsby is a very deprived area with fourth or fth generation unemployment. A once thriving fishing industry is all but gone, and the town is starved of big developments and tends to be forgotten.Weaposve been forgotten about for many years, Rachel says. But with Universal Credit itaposs made it even more dficult. People are struggling to budget for even a week.People who are are in debt are finding the authorities can take % straight from your Universal Credit when you get it.  Itaposs sheer desperation. Pam said in November last year roughly  people come into the foodbank. This November it was ,. She said: Itaposs a lot to do with Universal Credit. There is a lack of employment. The North gets ignored.  Pam started the charity  years ago and the foodbank five years after that.   years ago you would have never thought weaposd need a foodbank, but thereaposs a clear need for it, she said.  We are on our toes all the time trying to get enough foot to feed people.  And Pam says she doesnapost see things getting any better.   If something doesnapost happen, where are going to be in five years time Pam said Bradley, Rachelaposs son, has his birthday just after Christmas and, like any other lad, there is one thing he desperately wants - a bike so he can ride around with his mates. If you wish to support Rachel and Bradley, please visit the Just Giving page  here .If you want to donate to the foodbank, go to the RockFoundation page on the Local Giving website and write what the donation is for in the message. For example write aposfurniture for Rachelapos or aposbike for Bradleyapos in the optional message section.   Singer Lily Allen joins appeal Singer-songwriter Lily Allen has thrown her support behind a campaign to raise thousands of pounds for Rachel with a generous cash donation. The -year-old singer-songwriter donated to a Just Giving page set up by Hannah Parkinson.  At pm yesterday, Hannah set a target of £,, but admits she wants to raise more than that to sufficiently support Rachel and Bradley.

Hannah said it is a “moral disgrace” that people have to live in such poverty in . Her Just Giving appeal reads: “Watching Rachel talk to BBC News about how she has just p to her name and is only staying alive for her son devastated me. I’m sure it devastated everyone who saw the clip. “Nobody should be living – barely living – like this. Deaths from malnutrition in England and Wales are the highest they have been in a decade. Suicide rates in Britain are the highest in past  years. “A UCLreport found in  ‘an estimated , people died last winter in England and Wales as a result of living in a cold home’.” Lily Allen made an anonymous donation to the Just Giving page, meaning her amount is unknown.The superstar also shared Rachel’s heart-wrenching story and Hannah’s Just Giving page with her . million followers on Twitter .Following this, further donations have been rolling in – again mostly under ‘anonymous’ names and with unknown amounts.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA singer is hitting the road on a gruelling tour to break a Guinness World Record playing  dferent cities - in a week. Pop-star Minhee Jones will perform across Britain from December  to  in a relentless schedule. Guinnessapos rules for the record tour - during which she will be playing her Christmas single Next Xmas - are strict. Each venue has to be at least  miles from the last, each gig must have a least ten people in the audience with tickets and last at least  minutes. Finally - at least half the cities must have a population of over ,. Minhee will attempt three records - including most cities in twelve hoursand most in a day - twelve. She will raise money and awareness for the Music Venue Trust. The charitable organisation helps improve, maintain, and organise music venues and counts the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Elbow and KT Tunstall among its patrons. Minhee is independent of a record label and is self-funding so she is dragging some friends along to help - and some people she didnapost know but who have got in touch offering to help. Each gig must be on a stage - so Minheeaposs helpers will build a temporary stage in any venue without one. Timing is so tight - particularly on Saturday when she attempts the  and  hour record - Minhee has got two motorcyclists on hand to help her beat any traffic. They heard her on the radio and offered to take her and guitarist Jasmin Guea as pillion passengers. At the same time there is a Transit minibus and a car leapfrogging each other at alternate venues to get two sets of stages and musical gear there.  Minhee, who planned the route and booked the venues on her own, said: Fingers crossed it all comes together. There are a lot of moving parts and things that could go wrong - but that also makes it a fun, and slightly stressful, challenge. Hold ups on the roads and parking in town centres are a worry. Will enough people turn up  Do we plug the guitar into the wrong socket in a rush and lose precious seconds. We have these stages that promise in the marketing bumpf they go up in minutes, but I am sure they wonapost. Whatmy voice goes  Also on the motorbike I am pretty worried about getting cold. I am from Calornia and I am cold at the best of times.  Minhee moved to the UK from Los Angeles and now lives in London. She added: I toured all around the US with a band in a van - and places there are really spread out. Often we were driving six hour or more between gigs. So that gives me some idea of what to expect. She has got other support too. Ford heard about the tour - and how she was worried about doing it in her  year old car - and offered a Transit minibus and Focus estate. She was struggling to find venues in the mornings, but after talking to staff at her local Co-Op bosses at the chain said she could perform in their stores. Fender are lending her a speaker system for the Co-Ops and other places that arenapost usually venues, including a hair salon and a care home.  Lots of evidence in the form of photos, videos and tracking of the routes is needed for Guinness, and Vodafone had leant her phones, sims and trackers for the team to use - and stream performances on G. She came up with the idea of supporting Music Venue Trust - giving any proceeds from her Christmas single Next Xmas to the charity - when she was looking for places to play, and saw how many venues big and small had shut in recent years. Minhee said: Grassroots venues are vital locations for musicians to get out in front of an audience, build their confidence and hone their craft. But sadly many are at risk of shutting down. A lot of people say new artists should just focus on YouTube and social media to build an audience but we already live so much of our lives behind screens masking our flaws and it canapost replace the real human connection of being in a sweaty room in the same moment truly sharing that raw, real-time connection person to person. Thataposs why we are doing this - to support the dwindling yet irreplaceable grassroots venues that keep the singular magic of live music alive.

Met Office forecasters say rains will sweep in from Ireland late on Saturday night with downpours expected to last three to six hours.Scotland and northern partsthe UK will be worst hit by the deluge, with up to  millimeters of rainfall falling in some parts. Simon Partidge from the Met Office said: We could see up to mm of rain in Scotland on Saturday. Over the higher ground of Wales and southwest England we could see between -mm. A band of fairly heavy rain will move its way eastwards which will pass through quite quickly and should be well clear of the country by am or am on Sunday morning. Sunday will be a pretty blustery day for everybody with some heavy showers and hailstones in amongst it. A yellow warning for wind has been issued for an area extending from Blackpool in North West England, down through western Wales and south to Cornwall. The wind warning is due to end at am on Monday and showers will clear to the east. Bright and sunny spells are expected in parts of Scotland, England and Wales on Saturday.  But it will become cloudier and windier again, and rain will move across Northern Ireland to northern England and Scotland. Its warning reads: “A deep area of low pressure is expected to cross the UK from the west on Sunday and Monday bringing very strong winds to parts of the west. “Winds are expected to gust to -mph inland, and perhaps mph around some coasts. Large coastal waves are also expected.” Atiyah is the first named storm of the   season. The next storms will be called Brendan, Ciara and Dennis.  The Met Office and Met Éireann name storms because it brings greater urgency to their weather warnings. Research has found that people pay closer attention to the forecast and potential impacts when a storm has a name. In the UK, winds will gust to -mph inland and they could reach mph around some coasts during the storm named by forecasters in Ireland, where gales are likely to hit mph.

A sex club insider revealed: “The event is always Snctm but the character is unique in each city. “Our attendees come from the  per cent of the  per cent. “In New York that means more bold-face names of business and finance, while in LA itaposs more A-list actors, musicians, celebrities. “Our Miami list so far Iaposm seeing a few more recording artists and professional athletes than the other cities normally see.” All the stops are pulled out for these music moguls and sports personalities.  Devotees are on hand to provide the entertainment – and for this event, their erotic performances draw inspiration from religion. The Snctm boss explains: “Itaposs a level of opulence and excess that other parties may try to imitate but cannot achieve. “Itaposs not for everyone. Itaposs not for most. Our parties are made for those who are used to experiencing refined pleasures. “Weaposre singular because our members are singular.” A sexy soiree organiser ulged: “Our events cultivate a level of comfort where our guests can open up and explore their deepest fantasies.  “Itaposs not uncommon that guests will be found writhing in beds of four, five, six beautul people. “I canapost speak of the activities they partake in but it encompasses every fantasy you can imagine - often times they surprise even me.” If news of the party has piqued your interest in Snctm, you might be wondering how you can become a member. The sex club has a rigorous application process.

Their adventure has been dubbed the “real-le Le of Pi” following the  movie in which a shipwrecked boy is inspired to live by a stowaway tiger. Disaster struck Maurice and Maralyn Bailey on their  trip from Southampton to New Zealand when their -ft yacht hit a whale and sank. With little food, and relying on rainfall when water ran out, they had to turn to sea creatures to survive, catching turtles and birds and using safety pins to hook fish. Yet despite this, hundreds of friendly animals approached the rubber raft, inc­­luding dolphins, sharks and whales. Filmmaker Alo Cerezo said: “Their story reminded me of Le of Pi.It felt like a fable where animals are the lead actors and ‘never lose hope’ is the moral.” In the film, Maurice, who died last Dec­­­­­ember, says: “After so many months with them, we felt just like sea creatures ourselves.The sea was our le, the animals were our neighbours.” After  weeks the pair, both three stone lighter, were rescued by Korean fishermen after drting , miles.  Their adventure was turned into the book  Days Adrt. But over time the story was forgotten and after Maralyn died in , Maurice was left alone. Alo, , from Malaga, Spain, had been fascinated by the Baileys since boyhood.In  he visited reclusive Maurice in Lymington, Hants, for interviews he turned into a documentary. He raised the alarm after Maurice stopped replying to emails. He was found dead inside his house.

But the piglets all died within a week. Experts suspected the failure was to do with the IVF process but not the chimerism as the fertilisation process doesnapost work as well in pigs as it does in humans and other animals.  Tang is now seeking an alternative to try creating healthy animals with a higher proportion of monkey cells. If thataposs successful, the next step would be to create pigs with one organ composed of almost entirely of primate cells.

The day Broughty Ferry’s leboat Mona went down in a gale while out on a shout in the Firth of Tay, with the loss of all on board.The Mona had gone to the aid of the North Carr lightship, which was adrt in St Andrews Bay, and was last seen clearing the Tay in treacherous weather at .am.The lightship was saved but the Mona was found capsized at Buddon Sands four hours later.Her crew – coxswain Ronald Grant, George Smith, Alexander Gall, father and son John Grieve and John T Grieve, George Watson, James Ferrier and David Anderson – all drowned.The men of the Mona, all volunteers, lived and died by their motto that day – you have to go out but you don’t have to come back.James Ferrier was Penny’s uncle, her mother Lily’s brother. Penny, now , said: “I was  at the time and I don’t think I had ever seen my mum cry before that day.“I was really affected and very upset. We were living in England where my mum had moved from her home in Broughty Ferry after the war.“It was devastating news from home.”On the same day, nine-year-old George Anderson was off school with tonsillitis and staying with his granny, Elizabeth Anderson, on Fisher Street in Broughty Ferry. George’s father, David Anderson, was on board the Mona.George said: “I clearly remember a commotion at my granny’s door and I remember that everyone was desperately trying to find my mum, Lexie, who was at work in the Ferry.“Mum never even made it home before she was told about the tragedy and what had happened at sea.”The bodies of seven of the crew were eventually recovered. Only the body of George Watson was never found.‘RNLI saved my le – now I have joined the crew to help others’ Le-saving family includes policeman, plumber, paramedic and an undertakerIn a poignant twist of fate, George Anderson recently found an old photograph of the crew, with the diminutive George Watson completely hidden by the figure of James Ferrier in the front of the picture.George said: “I know beyond doubt that George Watson is in that picture behind Jim.“My mum had the picture and she knew that George was behind Jim, even although it’s almost impossible to tell that he’s there.”Penny said: “It was a very sad time. Mum immediately went back to Broughty Ferry and although she continued to live down south she kept in touch with her family there until she died.”Following Lily’s death, Broughty Ferry’s RNLI crew kept a promise to her and took her ashes on the boat and scattered them at sea, where so many of her family perished. vw, px\"  Penny said: “I also want to come home to Broughty Ferry to be buried at sea.”As for the young George, he lived with his mum and siblings in Broughty Ferry with the widows, children and families of the crew, and supported by the community.George said: “My mum was left a widow to bring up three boys. It was obviously a very dficult time for everyone.“Although I struggled at the time to fully appreciate the consequences of what happened, I knew that one day dad was there and the next day he wasn’t.”George has been an active supporter of the RNLI ever since, holding concerts on the th and th anniversaries of the tragedy and raising more than £, for the station in the process.A memorial service is to be held in Broughty Ferry on Sunday, before wreaths are dropped at sea by the leboat and her crew."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/5de8fae99cb164.30451460-448x564.jpg ","title":"dee must handle setbacks better","story":"Dundee can’t afford to feel sorry for themselves as they struggle for form in the Championship ahead of Saturday’s trip to face Arbroath.That’s the opinion of manager James McPake as he called on his experienced players to ensure his team can put out a much-improved performance this weekend at Gayfield.The Dens gaffer pointed to the lack of response from his side after conceding the opening goal in Saturday’s - defeat to Queen of the South and has challenged his players to do better.He said: “Of course, goals do change games and particularly when you are at home on the back of two defeats.“People do look too much into conceding the first goal.“You can concede at any time and by no means should it be a defining moment in any game –you say the first goal is so important thenyou concede you basically are saying the game is over.“I thought we recovered a wee bit but it wasn’t great.

kincardine candidates","story":"West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine is another volatile seat in which discussions over Brexit and Scottish independence continue to dominate.Despite a long Liberal Democrat tradition in the seat in the past, this is an election battle expected to be a two-horse race between the Conservatives and the SNP.Theresa May’s former parliamentary aide Andrew Bowie is hoping to win the seat again for the Tories, claiming to be “confident but not complacent” of success.Mr Bowie, who turned over a , SNP majority in  to win the seat with % of the vote, said Brexit and Scottish independence are the two main topics on the doors, but added voters in the north-east also feel “short-changed” by the SNP government in Scotland.He added: “There’s only been one choice, either the SNP or myself as the Conservative.“Brexit and independence are the two most dominant issues.“I think there’s a real desire for politicians to stop talking about those issues and get on with the day job and issues like the health service, broadband coverage and education.”The Conservative candidate claims voters in the constituency have had enough of the north-east being used as a “cash cow”.He added: “One of the constant refrains from voters is they want the north-east to get their fair share.“There’s a recognition that we’re the only party standing up for the north-east of Scotland.”However, he is facing off against SNP candidate Fergus Mutch, the SNP’s former head of communications and research, who thinks voters in the region realise they’re getting a “great deal” compared to the situation south of the border.He said:“A whole range of issues come up on the doors and we have an extremely well-informed electorate in Scotland.“There’s a combination of constitutional politics, people seeing the damage of Brexit, something they didn’t vote for largely in Aberdeenshire.“They’ve completely changed their minds in a lot of cases on the issue of Scottish independence.“They maybe voted No in  for security, stability and the quiet le and they certainly haven’t had that over the past few years.“When you set out to people what the SNP in government is delivering for them here in the north-east they actually realise what a great deal they’re getting compared to the south of the border.”Mr Mutch added that while the Tories’  campaign strategy, which put opposition to a second independence referendum front and centre, may have worked to “some degree”, he doesn’t think it will work this time round.He said: “My feeling is that may have worked for them in  to some degree because people thought this offered the security or quiet le that they craved after a few years of constitutional turmoil.“That’s proved to not be the case and people are looking to the next  years of the UK trying to cut trade deals with the rest of the world just to bring us back to where we are now.”Scottish Liberal Democrat candidate John Waddell, who came in behind the Tories, SNP and Labour at the last election with , votes, is campaigning on a  of stopping Brexit and investing the money saved into vital public services.And Scottish Labour’s Paddy Coffield has committed to ending austerity and to ensuring that the NHS has the resources it needs toat the level the public “expect and require”. vw, px\"  Party: Scottish Conservative and Unionist

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help.

He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared.

Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"holding-politicians-account-duty-not-bore","story":"Tuesday nightrsquos encounter was not an exact replacement for Kylersquos late and unlamented three ring circus.

Reading levels were up, but performances in maths and science were falling and at record lows. Lindsay Paterson, professor of education policy at Edinburgh University, described Scotlandrsquos overall performance as ldquostagnating in mediocrity.As well as being taken to task on education, the subject on which she has asked to be judged first and foremost, the First Minister was asked about the state of Scotlandrsquos hospitals.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media iFShJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests iFShJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This was not the first time she had been tackled on the subject on television. There was Andrew Neilrsquos now famous question to her on November  in his BBC show.After stating that only two of eight waiting time targets had been hit, Neil went on: ldquoChildren are dying in a new Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated, perhaps by pigeon droppings. A new multi-million pound Edinburgh hospital, should have opened in , is still unfit to open. You canrsquot even get the ventilation system to work. Yoursquove got the worst drug addiction problem in Europe but you cut drug treatment budgets by pound million. You clung on to your last health minister, you are under pressure to sack her successor. Yoursquove called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon : Sturgeon acccuses think-tank on analysisIt was a blistering inquiry. To be fair to Ms Sturgeon, she had responses for both Neil last week and her interrogators on Tuesday. To Neil, she pointed out, among other things, the pound million being put into meeting waiting time targets, the public inquiry into the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and the ldquoextremely high public satisfaction ratings for the NHS in Scotland. In the STV debate she highlighted the improvement in reading.The question here is not how she performed in both instances. She is an impressive politician, on the national and international stage. But why does it take a General Election for her to be challenged so robustly  Why are there not more such encounters For all Andrew Neilrsquos talents, he did not fall out of a magic interviewer tree. He is smart, fast, has a certain dogged style and command of facts and puts them to good use. Similarly, there was nothing radically dferent about the STV debate, other than the participants were allowed to cross examine each other, an innovation all other televised debates should adopt.There is no doubt that the First Minister regularly puts her record forward for scrutiny. She does it every week at FMQs for starters. It should be noted, too, that like the other party leaders, but not Boris Johnson, she went into the Neil den. He has been frit she was not. Over the past few weeks she has appeared in countless debates and phone-ins.Yet as far as television grillings go, it is only in the Neil interview and the STV debate that she has been robustly held to account.Granted, the notion that Scotlandrsquos First Minister is somehow given an easy ride will be laughable to some. Of the near dozen national daily newspapers in Scotland only one, our sister paper The National, openly backs independence and, by implication, the main party supporting it.Of the rest, as any visit to the newsagents will show, no-one would suspect them of being cheerleaders for the FM, and some are ferocious in their criticism.As for the BBC in Scotland, it comes under frequent attack for alleged bias, a charge it denies.This is not solely about the media, however. It is about a political culture that has become too settled and not questioning enough.In part the failure to hold the FM and her Ministers to account can be put down to the calibre of opposition politicians. A fair number, not all, are simply not good enough. Nor is the Scottish Parliament always sitting when problems arise.: Candidate leaflet defacedI do not believe that the First Minister is given an easier time of it because she is a woman. If anything, the opposite is true.The trouble goes wider than any branch of the media, or inidual politician. A few months ago there was a dust up on Twitter between Muriel Gray and Val McDermid. The row flared over a tweet by the BBCrsquos political editor Laura Kuenssberg and whether or not it showed bias against the FM. Ms McDermid said: ldquoI used to respect you @bbclaurak. Insulting a politician for doing their job, however, reduces that respect to shreds.To which Ms Gray replied: ldquoMocking politicians of all and every party instead of beatying them used to be the norm in Scotland. We were rather good at it. The bedrock of Scots humour. Not sure I even recognise this lsquoworship the great leader or rsquo thing. Itrsquos so not ...Scottish. And so it went on.Did Gray have a point  Is there enough distance in Scotland between the government and the governed, or after so long with one party in power has the situation become cosier than is good for us Every government makes mistakes. All governments can do better. There have to be ways of pointing that out that donrsquot meet with accusations of bias or unfairness.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmSearch and rescue teams have been launched tonight, Friday, after reports of a red flare off the coast of Westray.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But to be able to now officially say we have raised over twice the amount we set out to achieve is absolutely amazing. The donations came in thick and fast, and we are so grateful to all of those who contributed in any way. Orkney is a tremendously generous place, and the community has yet again come up trumps!#The rest of the money came in from donations from generous iniduals and businesses across the county, via a the newspaper or through The Orcadian website.“All of the money raised in this campaign will stay in Orkney, and is earmarked for this project, so we will very much look forward to seeing how the CLAN team get on with their plans.“They make such a dference to all of us who have been affected by cancer in any way, by giving advice, a supportive shoulder, support, therapies — even organising a roof over our heads during treatment.“They are truly amazing, and this money will mean that more people can benefit from the fantastic work they do.”#The monies raised, by the people of Orkney and further afield, through The Orcadian’s ‘OutreachCLAN’ appeal, will enable us to reach out to more people across the county who are affected by their own or someone ’s cancer diagnosis, and for that we are truly grateful.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mark Twain made it popular in America but mistakenly attributed it to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Apparently it originally came from an anonymous writer. At least that’s what it said on the internet, so it must be true, right Political spin and misinformation are nothing new, butfeels like the balance has tipped to the point where you genuinely cannot trust the majority of political information you see now on social media or hear on the television or radio – especiallyit comes from any of our main parties.: Nicola Sturgeon believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Tories getting majority: Jacob Rees-Mogg’s sister among Brexit MEPs quitting to back ToriesOutright political lies are now the norm. And I don’t knowwe can ever go back. Chancellor Sajid Javid was at it yesterdaymorning. He told Sky News that the  per cent rise in homelessness since  – when the Conservatives won a majority – was the fault of the Labour Party, who lost power in .The Conservatives have since issued a statement saying that he “misremembered” a statistic, but it was more that he got caught red-handed telling a flipping great fib. And Javid was meant to be one of the saner ones. But maybe there are none. And maybe we don’t want any.Feeding our biasesAll our political parties are indulging in the worst kind of deceit and manipulation. Spin and propaganda have always existed but when you genuinely need to fact check everything our political leaders say, you’re off to the wacky races.But do we actually care  Or are we so deeply polarised and entrenched in our camps that we are happy to feed our not-so-unconscious biases and feast on our daily diet of manipulated truth and misinformation  Do we even bother to fact-check anything as iniduals, or is that prospect as appealing as getting a new quote for your car insurance – because that may be something we all have to think about doing far more in the future.And there’s an interesting generational ide. According to new research by Intuit Research, the older you are, the less likely you are to fact-check a news story. Only  per cent of over-s polled said they would check facts to confirm the truth of a story, compared with  per cent of --year-olds.Given that older people are more likely to vote and lean towards the right and Brexit, you can see why the Tories are shamelessly pushing their fake news marketing to the limit. This is a vital voting group for them, and they are being ruthless.And it’s not just the Tories. Jeremy Corbyn has told us anti-semitism is all sorted. Jo Swinson has told us she’s going to be Prime Minister and is on course for a landslide.I don’t think there is way back. There never was a halcyon era in which the public had unwavering faith in what their politicians said, but we are now entering a Black Mirror world of wilful deception.I once did a  with Brian Stelter, who hosts the show Reliable Sources on America’s CNN. He said the art of fake news is to not tell a ludicrous lie. It was to gently shape the facts so they become what you want them to be.

The rail network is a gt to journalists, like no other area of transport, and not necessarily in a good way.While there are good news stories - like falling crime rates, and lowered fences for baby deer, to give recent examples - too often the industry attracts the opposite type of coverage.Shrinking coffee cupsApart from the perennial fare rises, delays and overcrowding - the booming railways are a victim of their own success - the industry has a propensity for repeatedly shooting itself in the foot.Like Network Rail’s failure to check bridge heights, which nearly forced the cancellation of the newly-restored Flying Scotsman locomotive’s triumphantto Scotland.Or incoming ScotRail Abellio asking staff to cut its predecessor First’s logo off their unorms. Or even First’s stewardship including shrinking the size of coffee cups on trains because it couldn’t cope with demand.Discontented workers and passengers don’t hold back on leaking me the bad news - like the latest ScotRail staff survey results, or its decision to scrap seat reservations. Then there’s the seemingly never ending woes of the new Caledonian Sleeper.By contrast, those responsible for promoting the railways need to up their game because far too often the “positive” news stories I write about rail are ones I have found myself.Perhaps Sir Eric might have recognised the predicament. In his inaugural presidential address to the institute in , he described the railways as the “great predominating factor in transport”.However, he said that despite their modest rate of , they “have figured in the minds of the masses as a great, bloated capitalist organisation, an object not of sympathy but rather of suspicion and jealousy”.A century on, I don’t have such prejudices, and I don’t go out looking for bad - or good - stories about the railways, or any other forms of transport, despite what some vocal conspiracy theorists claim on social media. I’m also not looking for ways to criticise - or praise - Sir Eric’s successors as transport ministers or the governments they serve.I’m just looking for interesting stories that our readers will find compelling, unexpected oruseful. I remain keen to hear from whistleblowers when things go wrong, but I’d equally like to receive new and interesting information from those who want to champion the railways.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"some working parents simply can t make things work that must change kelly ann woodland","story":"While there has been some progress in helping working parents, it can still be tough to juggle children and a career, writes STV News at Six presenter Kelly-Ann Woodland.Returning to work after a career break is tough going. Throw a teething baby and a brand new role into the works and it’s an emotional rollercoaster. A tiring, guilt-inducing, fraught, high-speed rollercoaster of a ride that never slows down. On the one hand, you get to go to the toilet by yourself at work. On the other, there’s a good chance you have a Cheerio in your hair. Many organisations are changing rapidly to ease ing to work and there are support groups out there to build confidence and help with the military-style planning that’s needed to balance work and family le. The opportunity to front flagship news programme The STV News at Six came when I was on maternity leave with my second son. I was six months in, with my head firmly focused on my kids. But this was my dream job and one I’d worked hard for. It would mean more hectic days, considerable planning, a y commute, a live show and a race home to put the kids to bed. So, was I right to go for the job I’d wanted all my le, despite the timing  Absolutely. For me, this was about making the right choices for the kids in the long-term and setting a good example. I wanted them to see you can go for the big jobs, irrespective of obstacles.: This is how maternity and paternity leaves around Europe compare: SNP unveils ‘game-changing’ plan for  weeks ‘Daddy leave’After clinching the job, I focused my efforts on trying to achieve that much-coveted work-le balance. I had a positive conversation with STV where we agreed new hours so that I could do the nursery and school run in the morning. I’d recommend going to employers with a reasonable but flexible plan and being open to a conversation about how you can both make it work – and thankfully, STV were receptive to this.As a family, we figured out a childcare plan, with my husband adapting his schedule and taking on afternoon pickups. I spend half my commute on the phone, organising the kid’s schedules. Loads of those calls are to my mum, who I’m very thankful to say is a godsend, especially when the kids are unwell.Exhausted before hitting motorwayLike loads of parents, there are mornings when I feel exhausted before I’ve even hit the motorway. And I’m not even going to get into the scrutiny of the appearance of women on screen, especially one who’s been woken up several times in the night before going live to half a million people each night. It simply shouldn’t matter.Alongside millions of other working parents, I’ve so many balls in the air and sometimes they come crashing down. I’ve still not managed to strike that perfect balance but a flexible working policy, an understanding boss, a support network and good childcare all help enormously. I’m trying to get into mindfulness, because self care is important too.There are many working parents with way greater demands on them, and many can’t make it work. There’s still so much more progress to be made. We need increased awareness that working parents can reconnect with their working self, they haven’t lost all their skills amidst a sea of babygros and sleep deprivation and should be encouraged to have a realistic conversation with employers about what works for them.If you see a job or promotion that you think is right for you, don’t be put off by the fact you’re on maternity leave.

Wealth and power imbalances stop people with erse lived experiences from interacting, negotiating and working to understand each other, but more importantly to negotiate a common good that is equitable. “We should never forget that much of our own culture and infrastructure is a product of imperialism and dominance. Built on tobacco and cotton harvested by enslaved people, profits from people starved and forced off their land, or backbreaking heavy industries, Glasgow has the opportunity to create a new future.”The blueprint – which envisages Glasgow being “globally recognised as a leading creative and cultural world city” – highlights how it is now home to  dferent cultural organisations, including the national orchestra, theatre, opera, and ballet companies, and is also “blazing an internationally acclaimed trail in contemporary art, design and music”.However, it also states that although culture has been “central to Glasgow’s evolution for at least  years, the city should not be constrained by so much reverence for the past that the new can never become established”.A spokesman for Glasgow Le, which runs cultural venues for the council, said: “This new plan has been developed to build on all that the city has achieved and is a starting point for a renewed conversation led by Glasgow’s creative community.“We want to consolidate Glasgow’s position as a truly international arts capital – nurturing and showcasing the best in local and international creativity, design and music.“We would encourage anyone with a role in the sector to respond to the draft plan and have their say during the consultation period to help shape the final version.”David McDonald, deputy leader of the city council and chair of Glasgow Le, said: “Our new draft plan seeks to set out what the city can do to ensure that culture in Glasgow continues to flourish over the next  years.We know that participation in culture – whether it’s watching a play, creating your own piece of art or singing a song - is a force for good, and an enabler of community empowerment that can increase our quality of le. In Glasgow, we have a vibrant cultural sector that gives the city an edge. It inspires, questions and challenges us to see our city and the world in dferent ways.Having just been named as the UK’s top cultural city we need to now create the conditions in which our confident cultural sector can develop and grow, and where our artists are nurtured in their work.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election poll snp on course to add an extra 11 mps","story":"A YouGov poll for the Times puts support for the Scottish National Party at  per cent, up one point on polling in August.The Tories are on  per cent, up eight points from the last poll, while Labour remains on  per cent.They are followed by the Liberal Democrats with  per cent support, the same as in August, and the Greens with  per cent, down three points.Writing in the Times, he said: \"Most of the seats being defended by the Conservatives are highly marginal.bull : General Election : Heres what the latest polls tell us about who will win the election\"Consequently, eventhe party retains all the support it won in , it could still lose a signicant number of seats , as our poll suggests, support for the SNP increases.\"The analysis suggests the Conservatives would secure eight seats in Scotland, the Liberal Democrats four and Labour one.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed the poll.He said: \"This stunning poll is a huge boost for the SNP in the final days of the election campaign - but there is a lot more work to do before polling day.\"This poll shows that it is only a vote for the SNP at this election that can lock Boris Johnson out of No , protect the NHS and see Scotland escape Brexit - and we will be pressing that message right up until pm on polling day.\"The SNP is the main challenger in every Tory-held seat, the strongest party of Remain, and the only party offering people in Scotland a choice over our future.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects.

He rejected any wrongdoing saying the holiday was taken in a personal capacity and was not paid for by the Malian government, but partly out of his own pocket and partly by a friend.He did not name the friend, but said that the friend was unconnected with his work and has received no benefit as a result of his work.Following a separate inquiry last year, Mr Paisley was suspended from the House of Commons for  days for “serious misconduct”.The watchdog ruled the then North Antrim Westminster candidate breached Commons rules on paid advocacy by writing to the PM to lobby against a UN resolution on Sri Lanka without disclosing family holidays paid for by their Government in .He later survived Parliament’s first ever recall petition.

The DUP, as often the case, is the exception. Given that focus groups we have run in Northern Ireland on the subject - from a range of backgrounds - all agreed that Sinn Fein would benefit most from the change, you can perhaps see why.Reducing the voting age to  could add nearly , young people to the electoral roll. Considering the marginality of several Northern Ireland constituencies, adding an average of more than , to each could make a dference to election outcomes - or a tight border poll.Momentum for votes at  has been growing for years.

The UUP demands it \"to demonstrate that we value and trust our young people of tomorrow\". Given only one in   to -year-olds voted UUP at the last Westminster contest, at least no one can accuse Steve Aikens party of naked self-interest.Of all parties elected to the most recent Westminster parliament, only the Conservatives and the DUP opposed lowering the voting age - and some Conservative MPs do support change. Scotland reduced the age of franchise for elections to its parliament and local councils in , having done so for the previous years independence referendum. Wales followed this year. Yet Northern Irelands devolved executive does not have the power - a rather important and curious anomaly that the parties favouring change do not mention in their respective manestos. There is no devolved Executive of course. As with much , Westminster or the Northern Ireland Office will have to decide.But is lowering the voting age a good idea  Whilst manestos are policy pledges not discussions, it would have been useful for the party manestos to tell us why.The UK led and the world followed in lowering the voting age from  to  half a century ago. Yet that change occurred amid consensus that the age of adulthood was . There is no agreement that -year-olds are adults. Votes for children may have scant appeal as a slogan. It might seem odd that young Scots could decide on the independence of their country in  but, as children needing health and safety protections, they could not buy alcohol, cigarettes or fireworks to celebrate or commiserate afterwards. Sixteen-year-olds could not drive to a friends house to discuss.Under the last Labour government - they used to happen, younger readers - I was appointed by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, to chair the Youth Citizenship Commission. Its tasks were to better connect young people to politics and examine whether the voting age should be lowered. Whether a middle-aged, politics-obsessed professor was really the person to solve youth disconnect is a moot point. I didnt, anyway. Only a minority of  to -year-olds voted at the general elections immediately prior to the commissions formation. And only a minority voted at the next three.In terms of  and -year-olds, they were evenly ided on whether the voting age should be lowered. The Electoral Commission had earlier found a clear majority of existing voters against the idea. So, we decided against recommending change. Given the advent of \"age-quake\", in which age is the most important iable in party choice in England, I dont think we did Labour many favours.Public opinion is showing signs of movement, however. Our recent survey for the Leverhulme Trust, conducted by Survation, found adult voters evenly ided on lowering the voting age and most  and -year-olds now in favour. Brexit may have made a dference.There are serious arguments for a reduction - just not the ones on tax, military service and marriage usually trotted out. Fewer people leave school at , get a job and pay income tax than ever before. You cannot see frontline service in the forces until  and no one gets married at  these days - you wouldnt get the parental permission you need anyway. Last year % of Northern Irelands marriages were of people aged  and over.Credible contentions for change lie where. Votes-at- would help balance an ageing society. The NI Statistics and Research Agency estimates that by  the population aged  and over will have increased by % - althoughNorthern Irelands health service crisis continues apace, that trend might be reversed. Arguments over capacity can favour change. A -year-old may have better critical faculties than a struggling -year-old - but there would understandably be outragethe latter was disenfranchised.So future elections could have dferent rules. With some polling stations located in schools and the new voters on site, maybe educational establishments could stay open. Would change be worthwhile  Only one in three  to -year-olds in Northern Ireland voted in the  Westminster election. If  and -year-olds are given the right, maybe it ought to be exercised  In the meantime, enjoy the show this Thursday.

They werent getting the same experience and I didnt think that was fair.\"Brian has now been on a Secret Santa mission to make his weekend grotto at the popular shopping complex a Winter Wonderland for all.\"Christmas should be an enchanting time for all children and I wanted to make sure everyone goes away with a smile on their face.

I also taught myself some Christmas signs, just enough to help me hold a conversation with a child.\"The thought of seeing the look on their faces when Santa speaks to them in their own language spurred me on.\"Brian likes nothing more than giving children of all ages the best Christmas experience, and also decided to discard the fake beard.\"If anyone comes in and tries to lip read, they cant see my lips,\" he said. \"The fake beard also muffled words for the hard of hearing. I thought a real beard was the right thing to do.\"I tried it last year by starting to grow it in September but it wasnt thick enough. This year the beard growing started in May.\"My we actually hates it,\" he joked.\"But shes putting up with it until Christmas Eve.\"Thats when its coming off. Shell have the real smooth me for a few months before I start growing it back for next year!\"Brian first pulled on the famous red suit for his daughters playgroup  years ago and went on to rope his children in as elves, making it a real family affair.\"Once I pulled the red suit on that first time, I was hooked. I was Santa and I loved the feeling of bringing such joy,\" he said.\"I have three daughters and theyre all in their s now. \"We loved Christmas as a family and they embraced the role as Santas elves, but theyre a bit too big now.\"I have two grandchildren now and they might join in when theyre old enough in a couple of years time.\"Brians grand-daughter was diagnosed with autism five years ago and another string to his Santas bow is the Silent Santa sessions at Bloomfield Shopping Centre which he runs at weekends ahead of Christmas.\"I got involved with the National Autistic Society in Newtownards, and that made me think about the kind of experience children with autism were having when they went to see Santa,\" he said. \"I know from experience that you need to give them a little more time, even just a few seconds, to build more of a connection with them.\"The noise, the colours, the bright lights and the crowds can all be too daunting for children with autism. Thats why we started the Silent Santa. \"I dont want parents to think they cant bring their kids to see Santa for any reason. \"We make it a safe, fun and friendly place for them to visit.\"His autism-friendly Santa sittings were along the first of their kind in the UK when he started them seven years ago and the commitment will go even further next year.\"Me and my we plan to complete a course in Makaton so that we can cater to even more children and adults with special needs - its all about them at the end of the day andwe can make them happy for just  minutes during our wee chat then we go home happy,\" he added.\"I want to be able to treat all the children who come to see Santa exactly the same. \"Its not a job for me, its the best feeling in the world that I can bring this much happiness to children.\"Indeed, Brian is so committed to his Santa role that he saved his annual holidays up from his normal job with Bombardier.\"I always make sure I have enough days of holiday in December to do this,\" he said.\"I need a week or two clear at this time of the year.\"Brian clearly puts a big effort in to make Christmas for everyone , and said it is a fine substitute for watching his own children grow up and leave the magic of Christmas in his own home a happy memory.\"Christmas should be the most wonderful time of the year,\" he added. \"Theres enough rubbish going on in the world around us these days so why cant we just enjoy a little bit of festive joy \"Its not just about the presents, the parties and the food. Its about spreading a bit of happiness, putting a wonderful smile on a childs face. Thats what makes me do this year after year.\"My own kids have grown up now and as a family at home the festive season had lost a little of its sparkle.\"By doing this Im getting that sparkle back.\"If you can bring a little bit of that Christmas spirit to just one child, and maybe a child who hasnt seen it before, then its worth the effort. Theres nothing better than seeing that magic in their eyes. You know youve enchanted them, made their Christmas a little bit special.\"I dont carethe line to see Santa is out the door orits half an hour past closing time, I will always give each child the time and patience that they expect from Santa no matter how long it takes me.\"Brians Santa is in high demand around north Down and it will be a busy couple of weeks before he can pull off his boots and hang up the red coat.\"I think my we, Mrs Claus, is probably most looking forward to me finally shaving,\" he said. \"Well be Brian and Jacqueline after Christmas Eve again.\"But once you pull on that suit you have to actually be Santa, its no good just looking like him.\"At Bloomfield Shopping Centre, they have been delighted with the effect their extra special Santa is having on families.A spokesperson for the centre said: \"The kids come in to see him and we all watch them go nuts.\"Hes such a wonderful Santa and does whatever it takes to make each visit special.\"Hes been rolling about on the floor making the children laugh and he takes such care to spend time with everyone.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

bpanews_fafe--ab-be-eceaddb_EmailThe Prime Minister often talks about his Brexit deal being “oven-ready” – but could what he’s planning to cook up leave a bitter taste for those in Northern Ireland .pushJeremy Corbyn and Labour certainly think so, after publishing internal Treasury analysis about what the Withdrawal Agreement could mean in terms of checks on goods being traded into the six counties from Great Britain.Boris Johnson denies there is any truth in the report, that Mr Corbyn called “damning”.Here is a look at what has been said, both now and in the past, about the withdrawal deal’s impact on Northern Ireland.– What is this document Labour has got hold of As with many Whitehall documents, the boring name – NI Protocol: Unfettered Access To The UKIM– disguises the signicance of its -pages of contents.Brandishing the analysis at a central London press conference on Friday, Mr Corbyn said the documents were “cold hard evidence” that Mr Johnson had been “misrepresenting” his exit terms as good for the whole of the UK.The Labour leader said page five of the document stated: “There will be customs declarations and security checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.“For trade going the other way, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there will be all of the above plus potentially damaging tarfs.”The possibility of customs declarations being required had been suggested previously by ministers – but for tarfs to be slapped on some goods was an entirely new proposition.If true, these new arrangements would have financial repercussions for businesses on both sides of the Irish Sea.– Is the Prime Minister conceding defeat on this Not at all – in fact, he has gone so far as to call the report’s contents “complete nonsense”, despite not having read it.“I haven’t seen the document you’re referring to, but that’s complete nonsense, and what I can tell you is that with the deal that we have, we can come out as one whole UK,” he told reporters on the campaign trail on Friday.– Has this always been Mr Johnson’s stance The Conservative leader has been firm on this throughout the election campaign.During a visit to Northern Ireland in November, at the very start of his UK election tour, he told businesses they could put customs declaration forms “in the bin” because there would be “no barriers of any kind” to trade crossing the Irish Sea.But Mr Johnson told the BBC in October, after agreeing his deal with the European Union, that there would be checks on some British goods in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland.“What we have agreed with the EU is that temporarily, and by consent of the people of Northern Ireland,there is stuff coming from GB into Ireland, or anywhere  in the world via Northern Ireland into Ireland then, yes, there can be checks,” he said.– And what about others in Government – do they think there could be checks Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, who was heavily involved in the negotiations, told MPs that customs “interventions” could be incoming after exit day.Speaking in the Commons in October, he said that “some information” and “minimal targeted interventions” would be required on goods travelling between the two parts of the UK, due to Northern Ireland remaining aligned with Dublin and Brussels’ trading rules for agricultural products and manufactured items.– So who is right on the customs and border issue Politics is rarely without “grey areas” and the mechanics of the Northern Ireland-Great Britain trading relationship after Brexit appears to be one of those areas.Page  of the Withdrawal Agreement notes that “nothing in this protocol prevents the United Kingdom from ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom’s internal market”.Butit were that simple, why have Mr Barclay and the Treasury got themselves so muddled over whether customs declarations and even tarfs might need to be applied The answer to that is unclear. But what is plain is that Mr Johnson’s main course on Northern Ireland has yet to win any five-star reviews."},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile dups shannon all but certain to see off alliance in strangford","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His dogged determination wins many friends - and that is an odd thing about Strangford. It is a friendly election campaign, full of genuine conversations, with election posters kept to a minimum. So close to Belfast, but so dferent in attitude. data-dfpadtargetingJim ShannonAnother factor stacking against those lining up to challenge the DUP in Strangford is that only in north Antrim did a greater percentage of voters opt to vote Leave in the  EU referendum.For Shannons closest challenger, capitalising on the voters who have switched their European view from Leave to Remain will be key.\"Were in this to give Jim a good run for his money,\" said Kellie Armstrong. \"He has a strong majority and we respect him for that, but weve been slowly eating into that.\"The local government elections gave us a surge. Ive been finding that a lot of people, particularly from the farming community, who had voted to leave the EU are now thinking that this is their chance to show that theyve changed their mind.\"Issues such as health and education are concerns. Though theyre devolved matters, people are starting to think that a stronger voice at Westminster will help speed up aof the Assembly.\"Mr Shannon, however, remains the key factor in the constituency.Indeed, he was singled out for his hard-working approach by DUP leader Arlene Foster at last weeks party manesto launch.\"Its Shannons to lose - its just a question over what the majority will be,\" said Paul Symington, editor at local newspaper The Newtownards Chronicle.\"Alliance have made good gains and its a question of whether they can continue that surge, but Jim has an enormous personal vote. He spends all his time on the road. There are representatives who are hands-on with their community, then theres Jim Shannon. He takes it to a whole new level.\"Were as surprised as everyone  that UKIP are standing. Joe Boyle plugs away for the SDLP every election, Philip Smith for the UUP is articulate and competent and its natural territory for the Greens. We have the longest coastline of any constituency and as theyare not standing in north Down, they have to maintain a good presence.\"Mr Shannon is taking nothing for granted and has racked up more than , steps a day on the campaign trail.\"There have been a lot of hard, honest conversations,\" he said. data-dfpadtargetingKellie Armstrong\"Its clear the people want aof the Assembly and theyre not afraid to tell me.\"Our position on that is clear, as is our position on the Union, which Im finding is even more important to people in Strangford than Brexit.\"Theres anger at Boris Johnson.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Ads for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingFrank McCoubreyGerry Carroll\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.The mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Mr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Mr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Thompsons we, standing right behind, doesnt mind a bit. \"It gives me a break from him,\" she jokes.Andy and Kim Ward, out walking their little dog Wicket, stop to chat to the candidate. Their big concern is the education budget. As low income parents, theyre stretched when their childrens school asks for donations to fund trips.The couple tell Little-Pengelly theyve no problem with an Irish Language Act but think it shouldnt be publicly funded.The conversation continues until the pink-collared Wicket grows impatient and strains at the leash to move on. data-dfpadtargetingAlliance’s Paula BradshawDUP’s Emma Little-PengellyDUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly talks to constituent Aarika McFarland in TaughmonaghFurther up the street, the DUP MP is invited into Angelas home to warm herself on a bitterly cold afternoon. \"Poor Emma, you must be foundered,\" she says. \"Winter elections arent great,\" confesses Little-Pengelly. \"My calf muscles are sore from all the walking, even a Radox bath hasnt helped much.\" Angela sings the politicians praises for her efforts in moving her up the queue for major surgery.\"Ive just passed the -week post-op period and Emma has been in touch constantly with messages. The DUP is always there for you. With them, you feel youre not alone,\" she says.Little-Pengelly admires the cream and grey décor in Angelas immaculate living-room, her pink rug and especially her Christmas tree adorned in matching colours. \"Pale pink is very in this year,\" she remarks.\"My living room is grey and cream too, but Ive a duck egg blue rug. And you put me to shame with your beautul tree. Ive mine up, but its not decorated yet. It looks so miserable with no lights or tinsel.\"A new addition to the DUP canvassing team is William Traynor, who ran for UKIP in Mays council elections but has since joined the party. \"Its tight between Emma and the SDLPs Claire Hanna, but I really hope that we can do it,\" he says.Little-Pengelly has faced fierce criticism for becoming embroiled in arguments about UVF flags and for not building bridges in erse South Belfast, which she denies.\"I have reached out, thats what Im about, its who I am,\" she says. \"I held a constituency outreach in the Markets and an advice clinic in the Belfast Islamic Centre.\"I reached out on Twitter to the LGBT community and the GAA. Im confused about claims that I havent reached out. The DUP condemns paramilitary flags, but I try to sit down with people to address issues rather than just jumping up and down about them.\"Over in the liberal and increasingly Catholic Rosetta area, residents certainly dont see their DUP MP as a bridge-builder. At many doors shes denounced in a way that youd expect in republican Belfast, not in this middle-class and moderate district.SDLP candidate Claire Hanna doesnt bring her rival up, but voters do. \"I cant stand that woman Pengelly,\" a female householder says. \"I want to wake up on December  to find the nightmares over and we have a new MP.\"A pensioner says: \"Shes not our MP, she never was our MP. In the two years since she was elected, Ive not seen her once around these streets.\"Hannas canvassers meet outside The Frying Squad chip shop. Its by no means purely an SDLP team. Two Green Party activists and two former Womens Coalition members are there. data-dfpadtargetingAlliance’s Paula Bradshaw talks to a constituent as she canvasses in NewtownbredaLisburn Road in south BelfastThe candidate needs to secure support from outside her partys usual voting base, and the evidence from the doors is that shes doing that.\"I normally vote Alliance, but youll get my preference this time because I think youre the person to oust our current Westminster representative\" a man tells her.\"If you lend me your vote, Ill look after it,\" Hanna pledges.A Co Armagh teacher says: \"I usually vote People Before Profit, but Im with you in this election. I hope Enmma Little-Pengelly comes to my door so I can give her a piece of my mind.\"Hanna is warm and chatty as doors are opened by busy parents putting kids to bed or mums already in their pyjamas.\"Id be in mineI wasnt out here doing this,\" the candidate says. Many know her from the school gates or parks. Others have seen her whizzing about the area on her bike.One woman asks who will succeed her as South Belfast MLAshes elected to Westminster. \"There will be an internal party contest. Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.\"Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.\"The compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. \"Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable. South Belfast currently seems set toto the party and be represented at Westminster by a new female face."},{"url":null,"title":"fai reveals net liabilities of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These expenses, it said, have now been disclosed.Auditor Deloitte said it had not obtained all the information and explanations it considered necessary for the purpose of its audit of the FAI’s finances.The independent audit, which was commissioned on behalf of Sport Ireland, shows that the organisation has bank loans of . million euro.Deloitte also said it was was unable to determine whether adequate accounting records had been kept and were also unable to report the disclosure of the directors’ remuneration and transactions.The FAI had previously stated a profit of . million euro for , however after adjustments of . million euro were made, they reported a loss of . million euro.Fine Gael’s Noel Rock said the “stark accounts” of the FAI pose major concerns as to whether it can continue toand meet its liabilities.The Dublin North West TD said: “These accounts published today display huge debt burdens and come against the backdrop of the FAI losing its most lucrative commercial contract.“It is a dark time for the administration of football in Ireland.“There are numerous questions now that have to be answered about their financial obligations, commercial arrangements and how they intend to continue to .“Deloitte clearly decline to state that it is a going concern.“This is a signicant development as it will mean the FAI will find it dficult to obtain refinancing for its existing debt obligations.“This is a concerning development for football fans. Answers and leadership are urgently needed.“The hard-working staff, FAI coaches and volunteers across the country have been treated shambolically with this.“Professional and diligent employees working for the better of Irish football have been left wondering about their livelihoods. “It is simply not good enough and cannot be accepted at any level.”Fianna Fail spokesperson on sport, Marc MacSharry, said the organisation’s accounts confirm the “worst fears” regarding its financial situation.He said: “The accounts revealed are massively worrying for the future viability of the FAI.“Questionable decisions have been made by people in leadership roles over the past number of years which have led to the financial crisis in the FAI revealed today.”“The publication of the accounts comes after news FAI President Donal Conway will step down at the January EGM and confirmation that communications company Three will not be renewing their sponsorship deal with the organisation when the current deal ends in July next year.“It shows the appalling state the FAI is in at present.“There needs to be accountability and I will be working to establish what options are available in this regard but, we also need confidence restored in the FAI.”Mr Delaney agreed in April to voluntarily step aside following disclosure of a , euroloan he gave to the FAI and that he made a series of payments from FAI funds that were not in the ordinary course of FAI business.A number of investigations have since been launched into the financial affairs of the FAI, amid concerns that Mr Delaney failed to use his credit card properly and failed to control his personal expenses.The audit was referred to An Garda Siochana last month."},{"url":null,"title":"on the campaign trail on saturday","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has pointed to an ageing population, delayed transfer of care, inadequate nurse staffing levels and lack of funding as contributing factors. “While often seen by many as an ED standard, waiting times such as the ‘ hour standard’ and the number of patients spending gt  hours in our EDs are better seen as barometers of the wider health and social care system pressures.“Over a third of our patients currently spend gt  hours in our EDs, with  patients spending gt  hours in our EDs in the  months from April - September  - a year on year increase of %.In the last  hours alone around  patients spent gt  hours in our EDs.“The waiting times in our EDs are virtually entirely attributable to factors out with the control of our ED teams.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs are as a result of our growing and ageing population compounded by failures in other parts of the health and social care system including access to primary care, elective care and palliative care.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs is accompanied by increasing numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and therefore beds on wards.“There is a lack of al capacity in our hospitals as a result of the reduction in the number of hospital beds by around % since   compounded by the extraordinary number of bed days lost as a result of delayed transfers of care.“A delayed transfer of care is where a patient is deemed to be medically fit to be discharged from hospital but where this cannot occur due to the lack of availability of social care, such as packages of care to support a patient in ing home, or residential or nursing home places. “The outrun of this is that bed occupancy is running at% across many of our hospital sites in core specialties such as general internal medicine and care of the elderly when the widely accepted standard is %.“Consequently, there is a lack of patient flow through our hospitals and onwards into the community, with the majority of our patients referred for hospital admission spending long periods of time in our EDs awaiting beds onwards.“When the majority, or all, of the rooms cubicles in our EDs are occupied by patients awaiting beds on wards then there is physically no appropriate space to assess further patients.“Furthermore, there are often inadequate nurse staffing levels to safely manage the clinical workload. The numbers skill mix of nursing staff may be below that required to deliver safe, effective care in a timely manner to our ED patients, let alone to do so concurrently with those patients awaiting beds on wards.“The lack of appropriate physical space and inadequate nurse staffing levels further impacts on the waiting times for those patients who are not referred for admission.“As we approach the winter months from our lowest ever baseline we must expect waiting times and the unprecedented risks to quality of care and patient safety to increase further as even more of our patients spend even longer in our even more crowded EDs.“In practical terms, it is simply impossible for our ED teams to be expected to deliver more with less year on year.“The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has consistently highlighted the deepening crisis in our EDs over time.“Seeking to do things dferently or more efficiently will not offset the need for corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Long-running plans suffered a further setback in recent weeks when it emerged that student intake for the  academic year had been ruled out. The revised target is recruitment for .In its initial phase the Medical School will be based in existing buildings at the Magee campus. Annual running costs of poundm had been quoted by the Department of Health.Ulster University has provided a breakdown of costs, details that would’ve formed the basis of its business case submitted to the Department of Health.The university says it will cost poundm per year to train  medical students, a third of which goes directly to Health and Social Care Trusts.An Ulster University spokesperson said: “In its initial phase of implementation the medical school is intended to be delivered within the existing campus estate, alongside current medical and healthcare provision.“The projected running cost for  medical students by  , when the Graduate Entry Medical School would be fully operational, is poundm per year. This is the annual cost to train doctors to completion of their Foundation training.“Of this, almost poundm is University funding for teaching and appointments and just over poundm is for the Trusts and GP practices whilst the students are at University. Just over pound.m goes directly to the Health and Social Care Trusts for the salaries, essential further training and assessment of just over  of our qualied medical graduates once they are Foundation doctors working in hospitals, caring for patients. “Annual costs for the implementation phase over the first four years of operation are considerably lower.”Plans for a medical school in Derry have been ongoing for the past fteen years before truly taking shape in  when its case was submitted to the General Medical Council.The first cohort of students were due to start training at Magee this year but that target was missed and planned intake for  has now been shelved.The Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Care and its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together. Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications. Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional poundm per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of the University of Ulster in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.It is anticipated around  doctors will train in Derry in the schools first year, rising to  students per year within its first five years. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Murphy was in court last week to contest the costs the department is seeking from him. He lost his judicial review in  in the High Court and Court of Appeal and failed in his application to have the case heard in the UK Supreme Court. However, he and his campaign supporters remain hopeful that the matter will be heard in the highest court in Europe, the European Court of Justice. “The Court of Appeal, acknowledging that my case was of public interest, made no order as to costs. The United Nations and the IPCC have issued warnings as recently as this week that countries must make their protected areas bigger and more connected. They have called for a five-fold increase in efforts.”“What is unfolding at Lough Beg is the complete opposite of what the Northern Ireland government must do in the face of the planet’s climate and ecological emergency.”He stated that: “The DfI’s reckless disregard for the climate crisis and the well-being of countless future generations, swans, orchids, insects, otters and eels is a crime against the planet. “Under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives as transposed, the deliberate destruction of a protected habitat such as the wet grassland at Lough Beg, which is ally linked to the Lough Neagh and Lough Beg Special Protection Area, is a wildle crime.”“What continues to motivate him is the hope, shared with thousands of others, to save something of le on earth that is accepted to be special and rare, an ecosystem that could be infinitely giving. “Lough Beg is Ireland’s premier freshwater wetland for bird le. It’s  bird species are more than any other inland site in the whole of Ireland. Since  it is listed as a Ramsar Site of International Importance as a Wetland for Water Birds, and was designated a European Special Protection Areain .”He adds: “Lough Beg’s wild swans, lapwings and curlews that my we, Doris Noe, and I have watched and loved for  years have no way of coming to court themselves. “In the absence of membership organisations such as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trustand the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds– who we discovered have bought into the scheme – Doris and I went to court to speak on behalf of this wetland and its wildle.”“We spoke the truth about what we know of climate science and ecology. We presented incontrovertible evidence and statements of fact, together with relevant case law and statutory law. “Through time consuming cross-referencing and Freedom of Information enquiries we uncovered numerous, serious irregularities which the Department for Infrastructure, its consultants and the RSPB, have until now covered up. “For example, the suppression of ‘inconvenient’ advice, evidence, legal or scientic information out of date conservation objectives distortion and manipulation of essential data the absence of expert, independent or objective consultation other than that received from its statutory conservation advisors all of which was either concealed, conflated or ignored.”“The inclusion in the scheme of a suite of mostly meaningless and unproven measures agreed between the department’s consultants and the RSPB poses a grave risk to all protected wildle and their habitats. “The European Court of Justice has deemed identical measures in Ireland, Holland and Germany to be unlawful.”“This unlawful ‘mitigation’ includes carrying out research into a discrete population of wild swans for the purpose of testing theories relating to controlled disturbances during the construction of a dual carriageway on top of their ancestral wintering home. This ‘research’ commissioned by the developer and paid for by the taxpayer is a wildle crime in itself.”He added: “Our legal action was the last resort in a long-running campaign to save Lough Beg. We are heartened to see that the public discourse is coming to understand the dangers of environmental degradation we were trying to highlight in court. I met the court’s Taxing Master on Wednesday and am faced with paying costs awarded against me by the High Court in April , invoiced almost two years later.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The event at Littlehands SureStart in Rosemount was to promote the importance of registered childminders For the last  years NICMA has been delivering support services for Registered Childminders who provide , day care places for children across Northern Ireland. Teresa McKeever, a Registered Childminder from Derry, said she gets great satisfactionfrom what she does. “I love childminding. I’ve been doing the job for less than a year, although I have been involved in the childcare sector for over  years. Every day I have a real sense of job satisfaction. You can really see children grow, develop and learn. Childminding plays a transformative role in children’s lives. The training, checks and visits are critical to keep the children safe and it’s only what you would expect,you were leaving your child with someone to ensure peace of mind. googletag.cmd.push “As a Registered Childminder, I am professional in my approach and I am committed to continuous personal development and training. I would encourage others to consider childminding as a career. It is so rewarding and the flexibility it offers means you can choose how many hours you wish to work every week.” Patricia Lewsley-Mooney CBE, NICMA CEO, commented: “The Festive Bake Off is just one part of a wider programme of activity which has been organised to encourage parents to consider the many benefits that come with using a Registered Childminder to care for their children. At the event, children will be baking healthy treats and doing some Christmas crafting. These are the type of creative activities Registered Childminders do on a daily basis with the children in their care. googletag.cmd.push “It is important that parents think about their choice of childminder. We know that parents ultimately want to keep their children safe, and some parents will feel that they have a choice to make between using a Registered Childminder or an unregistered childminder. However, quite simply there is no choice. The law is very clear, anybody looking after children for more than two hours a day, for reward, must register with the Health and Social Care Trust. Registered Childminders will have completed Access NI Checks on all iniduals in the household over the age of  and will have Public Liability insurance cover. “A Registered Childminder will also be required to update mandatory training every threeyears. They will be registered by the Trust and inspected on an annual basis by Early Years Social Workers. These checks help to keep your child safe, so you really should carefully consider who is looking after your child. In addition, NICMA provide advice and work in partnership with other organisations such as Family Support NI and the Western Childcare Partnership , who detail local services and information to support you and your family.” Throughout this year and next the Western Childcare Partnershipwill be supporting the awareness campaign to which it is hoped will also promote childcare as a career option to address the decreasing number of childcare places within the area and also to challenge unregistered childcare within the WCP locality.

The victory elevated Derry to seventh place in Division C, where they sit just three points off third placed Omagh. It was perhaps more hard fought than it should have been, but the win over Bangor was ultimately all that mattered.“Although there was only one point in it we played really well and we were the far better team,” coach Richard McCarter reflected.“The one thing we were probably guilty of was not being clinical enough and not taking our chances because on another day we could have won that by  or  points. They didnt get out of their own half until the final ten minutes. They got a late penalty which was quite far out but their kicked had kicked a couple of good conversions from the touch line so my heart was in my throat a wee bit. Other than that we were fairly comfortable. Well take the four points and move on to the next game.”Derry will welcome league leaders Enniscorthy to Judges Road on Saturday, their first home game since the victory over Clonmel on November . This will arguably be Derrys biggest test so far but McCarter is confident that things can go his teams way to give them a huge boost heading into another important game at Midleton ahead of the Christmas break.“That was the hope - that we could win against Bangor which would lead us into a big home game against Enniscorthy,” he explained. “If we can get something out of that, it would set us up nicely to go down to Midleton for the last game before the break so hopefully we can give it a rattle this week.“Its just so important and thats why these games against teams in and around us are so important to win. If you lose them you could be bottom of the table. Thats what we said to the boys before last week- it was a muct win match for us. By pm we could genuinely have been bottom of the table while a victory could have put us in the top four. Although were not exactly in the top four, we are only two or three points off third so were sitting nicely at the minute.”The season so far has not been straightforward for McCarter, Paul OKane or the players but they have been able to hang in there to put themselves in a position of real opportunity heading into the festive period.“We still cant put out the same team two weeks in a row so in terms of getting momentum and consistency its hard to do that whenever youre chopping and changing the team every week,” McCarter continued. “Thats the big thing for this block of three – getting as many familiar faces out as we can and try and build momentum. I think we can win these next two games and evenwe can win one out of the two it still leaves us in a decent position heading into the New Year and hopefully then we can get a few boys back and have the hunger to finish out the season on a real high.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old.

The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up.

He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site.

It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

But the DUP gave no hint it will row back on its pledge not to back the as an alternative prime minister Jeremy Corbyn in a hung parliamentTrade experts, business groups, some of Mr Johnson’s ministers and his own government’s document explaining his deal make clear that it will involve additional burdens on goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and vice versa.But yesterday Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn revealed a leaked Treasury analysis of his proposed deal – which he attempted to rush through the Commons with minimal scrutiny before calling the election..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Johnson has made clear that he will attempt to get MPs to pass his “oven ready” deal soon after the election.Yesterday Mr Corbyn, whose manesto rules out even a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, said that the confidential document “drives a coach and horses” through Mr Johnson’s claims and further exposes the prime minister for “deliberately misleading” the public.The Labour leader brandished the dossier marked “official – sensitive” at a press conference on Friday, saying it is “cold, hard evidence” from the Treasury that the PM’s Brexit deal would damage the nation.The report sets out the belief that there will be customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit, something Mr Johnson has claimed would not happen.The Tories said the documents did not back up Mr Corbyn’s “wild conspiracy theories” but did not specically rule out the presence of a customs border in the Irish Sea under their deal.Mr Corbyn said: “We have now caught Johnson red-handed misrepresenting his own Brexit deal.”The document, Mr Corbyn added, “drives a coach and horses through the prime minister’s claim that there will be, in his words, no border in the Irish Sea”.Mr Corbyn highlighted page five of the document, which lists customs and security checks on exports from Northern Ireland to Great Britain as “potential fetters” to trade.For goods travelling in the other direction, the document says tarfs, customs declarations on imports, checks on safety, security and regulations are possible issues., Jamie Wildman , Rev David Walsh , Jim Hakewill , Clare Pavitt , Chris Nelson \"  , Jamie Wildman , Rev David Walsh , Jim Hakewill , Clare Pavitt , Chris Nelson \"  Ketterings parliamentary candidates vie for your vote at local hustings Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The PM suggested last month that Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was wrong to say goods would face checks under his deal and Mr Johnson has been backed up by Julian Smith. Tory Party chair James Cleverly said: “The Conservatives have negotiated a great new deal with the EU which takes the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, out of the EU.”Mr Corbyn was joined on the stage by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who said: “The issue of whether there are going to be checks is absolutely blown out of the water by this document, as is the suggestion that it won’t be bad for business.”The Liberal Democrats welcomed the documents as evidence the PM “has been caught lying to the British public once again”.TUV leader Jim Allister met secretary of state yesterday and said that in a “straight-talking meeting” he had “left Mr Smith in no doubt about the feeling of betrayal within Unionism and the united opposition across our community to the Boris deal which produces Brexit for Great Britain but not for Northern Ireland”.• Yesterday the DUP expressed concern at the implications of Boris Johnson’s deal.However, the party gave no hint that it will row back on its firm pledge not to back the man who most likely will be the only alternative prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn, in the event of a hung parliament.Lagan Valley candidate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, pictured, said the leaked document was “further demonstration that the prime minister’s deal would be bad for Northern Ireland”. The DUP chief whip said: “The DUP warned the prime minister about this. Despite his protestations, the facts are in black and white. That is why we opposed the deal in the House of Commons and why Northern Ireland needs the deal changed.”Sir Jeffrey added: “Jeremy Corbyn is using this as a campaigning tool but no unionist will be tricked by his rhetoric. He has in the past and would in the future work in cahoots with those who want to destroy the Union.”UUP leader Steve Aiken said: “Arlene Foster and her colleagues bear a heavy responsibility for this crisis and they cannot continue in denial any longer. The public deserve to know which DUP MPs were involved in negotiations with the government in the run up to Johnson’s deal and what they agreed  They should also reveal what additional financial package they were offered infor their support for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea.“Northern Ireland faces a serious threat to its position within the United Kingdom. The DUP cannot hide or minimise the role they played in getting us here.”try catch  TrendingInappropriate content, staff members personal information and threatening messages - NI schools contact PSNI over a fake Snapchat accountsNI snow alert -

It might lead to an increased vote for Ulster Unionist candidates, in protest at perceived DUP failures. The UUP says it is getting good feedback on the doorsteps. But the DUP says it is too, and it might be boosted by the polarised atmosphere.A weather vane seat for unionism is North Down. The UUP has a big task reclaiming the Westminster seat because it stayed out of it for so long in favour of Lady Sylvia Hermon, whose world view seems close to that of Alliance. If the UUP cannot win or at least be a serious contender in N.

There are many of us and we all intend to vote.We note with regret the manner in which so-called ‘legacy issues’ have been handled to date and we now call upon all inidual candidates and all political parties to state without equivocation their stance on the issue of the draft legislation arising from the Stormont House Agreement , pictured..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In particular we call upon all parties to express their clear opposition to the proposed creation of a ‘Historical Investigations Unit’ . We believe this proposal will:• create  expectations of long-delayed justice for victims of crime• create new victims and re-victimise existing ones in relation to trauma• undermine centuries of successful development of the rule of law by introducing arbitrary and capricious official opinions as a substitute for due process and judicial decisions• breach numerous articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and• facilitate a huge and expensive exercise in scapegoating those who worked to protect society whilst ignoring the perpetrators of violence.We will not countenance the perpetuation of what we see as a witch hunt – a witch hunt which is clearly designed to assist those who seek to re-write the history of the last  years in order to deflect attention from their heinous crimes, to justy terrorism and to blame others for the ensuing misery.We welcome the references in the manestos of two of our main political parties to their concerns about the HIU. We now call upon all parties to repudiate the concept of any quasi-judicial definition of ‘collusion’. The law already provides for the investigation and punishment of conspiracy to murder, perverting the course of justice and all other associated crimes.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
