It must have been in 1979 or 1980, while I was a member of the board of the English National Opera. The Prime Minister had not been very long in office when we invited her and her husband to a performance of Tosca.When it was over there was a little reception, in the course of which I went up to her and said I hoped she had enjoyed it. ‘Oh yes,’ she said, and then, to my astonishment, lectured to me about Tosca for several minutes: where it belonged in Puccini’s works, who had been the greatest singers of note, and much else besides.         Mr Norwich invited Margaret Thatcher to a performance of Tosca around 1979 when he was a member of the board of the English National Opera. After the performance, she critiqued the colour of one of the singer\u0027s kerchiefI realised that, typically, she had sent for a brief, and learnt it. (She could never bear to be seen at a disadvantage.) The lecture finished and with me still there, she had to find another superiority: clothes.PM: Of course, if one had been producing it oneself, one would have made certain changes.JJN: Oh really, Prime Minister, what changes for example?PM: Well, I mean, Tosca’s fichu.JJN: But, Prime Minister, what was wrong with Tosca’s fichu?PM: The colour, of course.JJN: Well, it was red.PM: Yes, it was red!JJN: But, Prime Minister, what colour should Tosca’s fichu have been?PM: Cerise.  From an obituary notice in the Daily Telegraph, December 19, 2001:Melvin Burkhart, who has died aged 94, was a fairground sideshow performer known as the Human Blockhead because of his ability to drive a five-inch nail or an icepick into his head without flinching. The Human Blockhead worked under a number of alternative titles, depending on which of his extraordinary repertoire of physical contortions he happened to be performing.         Melvin Burkhart became known as the Human Blockhead because of his ability to drive a five-inch nail or ice pick into his head without flinching. He worked under many titles given his skill contorting parts of his bodyAs the Anatomical Wonder, he could inflate one lung at a time and dislocate his shoulders as the Man Without A Stomach, he could suck his stomach back to his spine as the Two-Faced Man, he could frown with half his face and smile with the other half. Among many other accomplishments, he swallowed swords, threw knives and ate fire.He was universally admired by his fellow performers, one of whom observed: ‘Anyone who has ever hammered a five-inch nail into his nose owes a large debt to Melvin Burkhart.’  General Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord (1878–1943) was Chief of the German High Command. He supervised the manual on the Military Unit Command (Truppenführung), which was published in October 1933. Here is an extract:‘I ide my officers into four classes the clever, the lazy, the industrious and the stupid. Each officer possesses at least two of these qualities. Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can be made in certain circumstances of those who are stupid and lazy.         Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord (pictured right, with Kurt Gebhard Adolf Philipp in 1934) ided his officers into four classes of clever, lazy, the industrious and the stupid. He said the man \u0027who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest command\u0027‘The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest command. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity to deal with all situations. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous.’  My friend Brian Young told me some years ago that a sentence with a surprise ending is called a paraprosdokian. Examples are:Dorothy Parker’s:If all the girls who attended the Yale prom were laid end to end, I wouldn’t be a bit surprised.Or Groucho Marx’s:I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn’t it.Or Ogden Nash’s:If at first you don’t succeed, the hell with it.Or Alice Roosevelt Longworth’s:If you can’t think of anything nice and kind to say about anyone — why, do come and sit beside me.  Taken from THE ULTIMATE CHRISTMAS CRACKER by John Julius Norwich, published by John Murray at £14.99. © John Julius Norwich 2019.

Will this crucial UK election bring about a post-imperial day of reckoning?“We have got to fight against privilege,” George Orwell exhorted in 1941, “against the notion that a half-witted public schoolboy is better for command than an intelligent mechanic.” England, he wrote, is governed by an “unteachable” ruling class that too frequently escapes into “stupidity”, failing to see “that an economic system in which land, factories, mines and transport are owned privately and operated solely for profit ... does not work.”Only a socialist revolution, he continued, could unleash the “native genius of the English people”. Of course, “the bankers and the larger businessmen, the landowners and idend-drawers, the officials with their prehensile bottoms, will obstruct for all they are worth”. But, never mind: “if the rich squeal audibly, so much the better”.One measure of how little has changed is that Orwell’s diagnosis of the country he called a “rich man’s paradise” – and even his specific prescriptions: nationalisation of basic industries, abolition of hereditary privilege, educational reform and punitive taxation of offensively unequal incomes – still resonates, almost eight decades later, as the United Kingdom goes to the polls. The long English past of entrenched privilege and extreme inequality is back, if it ever went away. The problems stemming from archaic political and social structures, and an economy geared to further enriching the rich, seem even more intractable.At the same time, the wartime English patriotism that Orwell tried to alchemise into socialism as highly intelligent Germans tried to kill him has degenerated into self-destructive nihilism during the Tory onslaught on a German-dominated European Union – which countenances even the breakup of the UK.Fragmentation of the UK would of course leave the Welsh and the Scottish with a sharper sense of their political and cultural identity. Englishness, on the other hand, appears as foggy as ever. As the hunters of an authentic English national identity lurch towards a political climax, it seems worth asking: what is it all about?Englishness was always a form of theatre, first staged in overseas colonies. Discovering its traces in Rudyard Kipling and India, VS Naipaul remarked on how, “at the height of their power, the British gave the impression of a people at play, a people playing at being English, playing at being English of a certain class”. Today, in a post-imperial Britain run by half-witted public schoolboys, the English character seems even more, as Naipaul wrote, “a creation of fantasy”.Those such as Orwell, who saw through the fantasy, were usually mortified. He was born in Bihar in India to an opium agent, with a Caribbean slave-owner as an ancestor. While working as a colonial policeman in Burma, he discovered imperialism to be an “evil despotism” and Englishness to be a humiliating act: a pose of masculine authority and racial superiority necessary to keep volatile natives in their place. Others such as Enoch Powell, a lower middle-class native of the West Midlands, were seduced by this posture of stiff-upper-lipped preeminence. Powell became a classicist at Cambridge, taught himself fox-hunting, and wrote highly wrought Georgian verse he exulted, as a brigadier, in the hierarchies of empire in India. Then, like Curzon, Milner, Cromer and other purveyors of an Englishness made in India and Egypt, he came to develop a certain rather fierce idea of England and its destiny.Orwell, on the other hand, was an archetype of the unpatriotic leftwinger on his return home – until he found a lodestone of native English genius in the “red wall” of northern England. The spirited English response to Hitler’s vicious assault deepened his conviction of having discovered a new “emotional unity” in England – one that a socialist revolution could turn in favour of its downtrodden people. He persuaded himself that “England, together with the rest of the world, is changing”, and a new middle class blending in with the old working class would bring forth “new blood, new men, new ideas”.War did indeed awaken a spirit of social egalitarianism, leading to Conservative defeat in 1945. Some of Orwell’s proposals were partially implemented by the Attlee government. Still, there was always something too sanguine about the homecoming scenario of a deracinated intellectual. For, if England was a family, as Orwell claimed, with “rich relations who have to be kowtowed to, and poor relations who are horribly sat upon”, then, as a range of foreign and English observers noted at the time, it was a family marked to an unusual degree by sadomasochistic relationships.JG Ballard, another disaffected child of imperialism, who arrived in England in 1946 after three years in a Japanese internment camp in Shanghai, was not only appalled by his country’s “grotesque social ision” he also marvelled at the “system of self-delusions” that enabled a people comparable in their poor education, diet and grim housing to the menial toilers of Shanghai to give their lives to “an empire that had never been of the least benefit to them”. “The English class system, which everyone secretly accepted, for reasons I have never understood,” Ballard later wrote, was an “instrument of political control”. Far from collaborating on revolution, the straitened middle class feared and despised the working classes, especially organised labour, and was obsessed with enforcing codes of behaviour that were “calculated to create a sense of overpowering deference”.As for the upper class, the American critic Edmund Wilson noted in 1945 how its members manifested the “appalling” traits he had found in novels such as Thackeray’s Vanity Fair and Butler’s The Way of All Flesh: “passion for social privilege” and “dependence on inherited advantage”. The great New Zealand memoirist Janet Frame, discussing the seemingly unbreakable social hierarchy of England’s natives with other indigent New Zealanders and Australians in London in the 1950s, concluded: “They’re in the Middle Ages.”“Change, I felt, was what England desperately needed,” Ballard, reminiscing about the 1940s, wrote two years before his death in 2009, “and I still feel it”. Yet England’s political and social system had long been premised on regulating change when it favoured the middle class, neutralising it when it was demanded by the working class, all the while safeguarding the unteachably stupid upper class. Walter Bagehot, the Economist editor with an acute phobia for England’s poor and disenfranchised, put it frankly in 1867: the unwritten “English constitution in its palpable form is this – the mass of the people yield obedience to the select few” they “defer to what we may call the theatrical show of society”.Discussing the role of the monarchy in this show, Bagehot was equally blunt: “We must not let in daylight upon magic.” In other words, the masses of England were to be ruled by almost the same combination of pomp, bluff and repression that the natives of India were. The fossilised politics enjoyed greater legitimacy at home because the English had lived through much of the modern era as its winners, innovating industrially and expanding commercially before other countries the mystique of British power commanded deference, while perpetuating such archaisms as a single parliament representing four nationalities. Though as exploited and defrauded as Indians, the English people, Orwell wrote, “manifestly tolerated” their selfish, incompetent and often “silly” ruling class the “post-war development of cheap luxuries” in particular averted revolution.The Economist reassured itself in 1977: “Britain’s very stability, the beguiling flummery attending its institutions, hold most of its citizens in a trance of acceptance.” But the trance had begun to break after 1945 when, instead of enlarging the realm on which the sun never set, the English began to retreat and, simultaneous with the loss of colonial territories, the colonised started to arrive in a war-ravaged England. Powell, among others, had cherished a starry-eyed notion of the empire as a large multiracial family (with white males on top). But the unstated proviso for the imperialist paterfamilias was always that the dark-skinned family members stay in their respective countries and not seek to live, work and marry white people in England. The new arrivals, prompted by the postwar need for NHS nurses, bus drivers and other workers, quickly exposed this separate-but-equal chicanery of the “Commonwealth”. Writing in 1953 to his wife, Naipaul summed up the hostile environment the British empire’s previously invisible citizens confronted in England. Considered only “for jobs as porters in kitchens, and with the road gangs”, the Oxford-educated Trinidadian had been reduced, he claimed, to a “poor wog, literally starving, and very cold” with “no fire in my room for two days and only tea \u0026amp toast in my stomach”. “These people want to break my spirit,” Naipaul wrote. “They want me to forget my dignity as a human being.”The fact that most people from the colonies inhabited even lower depths of poverty, humiliation and despair had little effect on public opinion and policy. Racialised immigration acts were passed throughout the 60s the poor “wogs” were also repeatedly put in their place by the police, the media and politicians. A Tory candidate in Powell’s own stomping ground, the West Midlands, won his election in 1964 with the campaign slogan: “If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.”Still, those accustomed to lording it over dark-skinned natives in the outposts of empire could not be appeased. If, as Naipaul wrote, “to be English in India was to be larger than life”, then, to be English in multiracial England after 1945 was to know a devastating loss of manliness. Decolonisation had been outrageous enough for Powell, who had hoped as late as 1951 for Churchill to reconquer his great love, India. The appearance on English streets of dangerous savages against whom Englishness had been defined on the imperial frontier was just too much. The racial hierarchy in which he had forged his self was in danger of recalling the outbreak of virulent prejudice against Jewish immigrants of the period 1890-1905. As he put it in his 1968 “Rivers of Blood” speech (quoting an unnamed, “quite ordinary” person), “in this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man”. There was also something intolerable about the fact that imperialism had become, if not a source of shame and embarrassment, then a subject for comedy and satire among a younger generation – summed up by the album cover of the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Upstart darkies and cheekily androgynous Liverpudlians turned the 1960s into a hellish time for Powell.“What sort of people do we think we are?” he thundered in 1967. One self-pitying answer was: a “nation of ditherers”. The following year, Powell mutated into a ventriloquist for the silent majority – members of the white working class who worried about immigration, and were denounced for their honesty as racist, and ignored by “academics, journalists, politicians and parties”. In a classic sleight-of-hand of intellectual demagoguery, the former professor of ancient Greek claimed to be only articulating “plain truths and commonsense” that decent, ordinary people, bullied by a politically correct establishment, did not dare express.The usual temptation to hold foreigners and immigrants responsible for decline and stagnation was strong in England as postwar economic growth tapered off. In Kamala Markandaya’s outstanding, recently republished novel The Nowhere Man (1972), which is set in the weeks around Powell’s speech in April 1968, a white Londoner reduced to living with his wife’s mother is greatly relieved to discover that black people are to blame for his luckless existence. “A great light bursts upon” him as he receives Powell’s newly respectable wisdom: “They came in hordes, occupied all the houses, filled the hospital beds, and their offspring took all the places in schools.”Writing in 1970, the journalist Paul Foot pointed out: “all that has changed is that new scapegoats must be found for the homelessness, the bad hospital conditions, and the overcrowded schools”. Political theorist Tom Nairn cautioned, however, against the then common tendency to dismiss Powell as a posh race-baiter, or a moustached blast from the imperial past. Nairn pointed out that Powell, turning his back on an irretrievably lost empire, had set out to construct a post-imperial English nationalism with a mass base. The problem with English identity always was that it consisted of little more than a theatrical performance of brute power abroad by men of the imperial ruling class. It had lacked any broad content at home (notwithstanding Orwell’s infusions of socialism and his belated patriotism). More ambitiously and successfully than Orwell, Powell was now forging a native English genius at home by defining it, initially at least, against emasculating foreigners.Nairn predicted a long-term future for Powellism, which, he wrote in 1970, “actively stirs up conflict instead of conspiring to stifle or ignore it” and in an existential crisis “can pull the whole of the official structure of British politics in his direction”. In retrospect, Powell himself charted the high English road to Powellism, as he invested his zeal for stark antagonism in Ulster Unionism, neoliberalism and, finally, Europhobia: “Belonging to the common market,” he wrote in 1975, “spells living death, the abandonment of all prospect of national rebirth, the end of any possibility of resurgence.”A very different destiny for England, which did not involve quacks vending pills for imperial-era virility, was always likely. The possibilities lay in its multi-racial experience – something genuinely new in England since Orwell’s time. Some of the early arrivals were deeply damaged by it, such as Naipaul, who escaped from the humiliations of “wog-hood” into the company of those gratified by his scorn for “wogs”. But many others came to attest to the potential of much more fluid post-imperial identities. “I am an Englishman, born and bred almost,” the protagonist Karim Amir declares in Hanif Kureishi’s The Buddha of Suburbia (1990).Yet it was, significantly, Powellism that steadily built up to its present political apotheosis in Brexit – through the Thatcher-Blair years of deregulation and privatisation, a hardening political consensus against immigration, a tabloidised culture of journalism and demented Tory EU-baiting, all assisted by the propaganda empire of an Australian media tycoon almost as committed to a politics of xenophobia as his father, a stalwart of Keep Australia White.Until such time it could hunker down in Westminster, Powell’s hyperbolic Englishness renovated its original home in the realm of kitsch. In Julian Barnes’s England, England, a marketing company desperate to make money out of a country in rapid decay decides to build a theme park of Englishness on the Isle of Wight. A tycoon modelled on Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell persuades the royal family to move to a more up-to-date copy of Buckingham Palace as real England collapses into pre-industrial squalor.England, England, published a year after Princess Diana died and the Millennium Dome began construction, now seems a timely meditation on the fate of English identity. Englishness had descended deeper into parody throughout the 80s and 90s, as a Sloane Ranger princess let in too much daylight on the magic of the monarchy, and the devolutionary demands of Scotland and Wales uncovered the many faultlines in the notion of Britishness. Many a cultural and intellectual entrepreneur emerged during these decades, ranging from St George flag manufacturers to Churchill fanboys, hectically retailing Englishness, and elaborating Powellism in highbrow as well as lowbrow modes.Roger Scruton, the philosopher and author of England: An Elegy, took up Powell’s lament about the despoliation of England, giving it a neo-pastoralist orientation. Scruton, who shared Powell’s ancestry in northern England’s lower middle class, reinvented himself as a fox-hunting squire, as prone to defend public schools from his own Labour-voting father’s “resentment” as to sneer at the people who “litter the country with their illegitimate, uncared for and state-subsidised offspring”. As Tory-New Labour free-marketeering eviscerated traditional communities and social bonds, Scruton chose to deplore the loss of the stiff upper lip that “went with imperial pride”.Scruton in this mode embodied two of the “quintessences” of Englishness identified by Barnes in England, England: “snobbery” and “whingeing”. Nevertheless, the vendors of Englishness had judged their market well in the age of Reagan and Thatcher, when the passion for social privilege became de rigeur. A televised version of Brideshead Revisited, a novel breathless in its adoration of the well born, and contempt for everyone else, became one of the biggest British cultural exports to the US since the Beatles. Bedazzled by Jeremy Irons and Castle Howard, Ralph Lauren repackaged country-house poshlost for Americans, and even sold it back to the already Barboured English.The Raj, lavishly filmed in the 1980s, reappeared in the English imagination as an aesthetic spectacle, provoking awe rather than embarrassment. Many Americans succumbed to this imperial chic as well and made it more lucrative. Emerging just in time to cash in on empire-mania, Banana Republic’s range of khaki colonial wear offered an opportunity to vicariously quell, in jodhpurs and pith helmets, the mutinous natives of Sind and Punjab. In this sense, those British chancers who later crossed the Atlantic to exhort Americans to re-establish empire, and offer their expertise in governing Basra and Helmand, were only following the money.Arguments for carnage in Mesopotamia certainly sounded more persuasive when made with the Oxbridge cocksureness of a Christopher Hitchens, the Orwell du jour. Indeed, Englishness as a mode of glamorously aloof and omnisciently clever elitism became one of England’s chief exports. Orwell had railed against England’s “idle rich”, “living on money that was invested they hardly knew where”, and “whose photographs you can look at in the Tatler … always supposing that you want to”. Benefiting from a zeitgeist of feeling intensely relaxed about the filthy rich, Tatler’s circulation rose, and international editions bloomed, ushering the tuxedoed and begowned demi-monde of Jakarta and Manila into the pleasures of Cool Britannia.Old English nurseries of the imperial ruling class such as Harrow and Wellington opened franchises in Thailand and China, offering to transmit solemn lessons of white supremacy to crazy rich Asians. Two London-based publications run by the Oxbridge elite, the Economist and Financial Times, became the most widely consulted how-to manuals of financial globalisation, sagely instructing wannabes how to think and feel like the filthy rich, and even how to spend it.In Ballard’s last novels, England is reduced to offering up its cultural icons for Disneyfication to the world while preparing itself for authoritarian populism. The reality now seems to have closely approximated Ballard’s dystopic fiction all along. For, while Hugh Grant’s dimpled grin advertised the charms of the English family, its precious silver was being sold off. In a process witnessed in no other major western country, many great emblems of national power, prestige and glamour – British Steel, Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin, Bentley, Jaguar, Debenhams, British Home Stores, HMV, Cadbury, Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes, Hamleys – have either disappeared or gone into foreign hands since the 1980s. In September Thomas Cook, which once sold holidays to Churchill, became insolvent, stranding thousands of customers abroad and forcing the government to mount its biggest civilian rescue operation since Dunkirk.It is only in such a “stagnant, involuted atmosphere of a world near the end of its tether” that Powellism would become hegemonic, Tom Nairn predicted in 1970, healing wounded English pride with reactionary balm, and appealing “to the (perfectly justified) national feeling of frustration and anger”. More importantly, “because this feeling is so inarticulate, and so orced from the genteel cliches of the establishment”, Powellism could “suggest convincingly that something is profoundly wrong and that something must be done about it”.As Boris Johnson never tires of repeating: Get Brexit Done. Nothing like a dose of hard Brexit, he suggests, to toughen the national mind and body for the bracing climb to the sunny uplands of Empire 2.0. Like Powell, he presents himself as the saviour of England’s matchless destiny against the ditherers. And, election rhetoric notwithstanding, he shares Powell’s and the Brexiters’ conviction that a higher dose of deregulation and privatisation will make England great again. More disingenuously than Powell, he ridicules the piccaninnies as well as the aliens in black letterboxes, and reaches out to the Home Counties colonels with promises to lock up swarthy criminals and throw away the key. There should be no mistaking the neo-fascistic cults of unity and potency he promotes, and the insidious forms they assume in England’s tabloidised media.In Ballard’s last novel, Kingdom Come (2006), which drew inspiration from Robert O Paxton’s classic book The Anatomy of Fascism, English nationalism turns sadistically against those Powell stigmatised as hostile aliens. However, violent racism, which has exploded in recent years, is not nearly as sinister as the steady hardening of Powellite verities into bien pensant opinion. Centrist dads as much as unteachable Brexiters are likely to invoke his much victimised silent majority of ordinary, decent men, dispossessed by immigrants and then gagged by politically correct academics and journalists. Thus, as Simon Jenkins recently stated in the , Brexit “was about how far Britons can define and protect the character of where they live”.With Brexiters in the ascendant, politically as well as culturally, the triumph of Powellism is complete. But we may be looking at an instance, to borrow a term from the Bush administration, of “catastrophic success”. For Powellism remains, in its moment of hegemony, a symptom of rather than a cure for the seemingly insoluble crisis that Orwell diagnosed: the dwindling material basis of an ex-imperialist country that is unable to break, in a globalised world, with its antique assumptions of power and self-sufficiency, and whose fundamentally cynical Bagehotian mode of politics, in which the will of the few was passed off as the will of the many, is broken, unable to innovate and deal with change, or defuse the anger of those victimised for so long by social and economic inequity.“The life of nations,” Powell argued, “no less than that of men is lived largely in the imagination.” But nations that are too extravagantly imagined eventually pay a steep price for their system of self-delusions. Postcolonial India turns on itself in fury and frustration as its dream of power and glory explodes. England’s post-imperial self-reckoning feels harsher, largely because it has been postponed for so long, and the memories of power and glory are so ineradicable. In the meantime, the most important elections of our lifetime approach, and, as Orwell warned, “a generation of the unteachable is hanging upon us like a necklace of corpses”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2b3a4c25ba5cef36fe8661c8545d895cdb30f3/354_196_5539_3323/master/5539.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d997970db3608a5879fa733d7922eef5","title":"space invaders best books interstellar arrivals","story":"As the comet Borisov speeds across our universe, Alastair Reynolds shares books to expand our frontiersAll of a sudden the interstellar space around our solar system – the enormous gulf that separates us from the nearest stars and their planets – is starting to look congested. There is traffic out there: mysterious objects on their way between solar systems.The first time we spotted one of these interlopers was in 2017, when ‘Oumuamua – a long, thin thing about the size of the Shard skyscraper – pulled off the unusual trick of accelerating as it was heading away from the sun. ‘Oumuamua is almost certainly a piece of weird, attention-seeking rock rather than an alien spacecraft, but by the time we realised how curious this comet was, it was already speeding beyond the reach of any rockets.As a second interloper, comet Borisov, swims into our ken, complete with a cometary tail that could give clues to the biochemistry of another star, it’s worth remembering the vastness of the distances it has covered.If you have room in your life for only one gorgeous, all-encompassing and satisfyingly detailed reference work on our place in the cosmos, the DK Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Universe is one of the best out there, and – edited by astronomer royal Sir Martin Rees – it’s got impeccable credentials. Swoon over the illustrations and marvel at the scale of things. Astronomy reference books are always slightly out of date, such is the pace of new discoveries, but this book is still rarely off my desk.In the excitement surrounding the discovery of ‘Oumuamua, much was made of the apparent similarities with the object at the heart of Arthur C Clarke’s 1973 novel Rendezvous With Rama. Initially thought to be an asteroid, the titular Rama turns out to be a long, hollow alien spacecraft. Like ‘Oumuamua, it just happens to be passing through – but in Rama’s case, an expedition is just about feasible. Clarke’s novel is dated in some regards, but in terms of presenting the pure thrill of discovery it remains one of the most compelling novels in the SF canon.A significant triumph in recent astronomy has been the detection of gravitational waves, finally achieved by an international consortium using immensely precise (and huge) laser interferometers. But the work to reach this discovery began a century ago, and encompasses a huge cast of heroes and dreamers – and its share of failure. In Black Hole Blues astrophysicist Janna Levin has written the definitive account of this grand quest, and it’s as insightful about the human protagonists in this story as it is about the mind-bending physics of black holes and warped spacetime.Interstellar visitors need not be as large as Rama to wreak transformation, especially if there is intelligence at work. In Tade Thompson’s Rosewater, which won 2019’s Arthur C Clarke award, an alien construct hits London, then tunnels all the way through to Nigeria, eventually emerging and releasing spores that begin to affect human neurological functioning. Thompson continued the story with Rosewater Insurrection, with the final part of the trilogy, Rosewater Redemption, published this year.And while it might not be interstellar in origin, the close approach of a comet of another kind provides the narrative mainspring for Liz Williams’s forthcoming Comet Weather, a brilliant, genre-defying novel of astronomy, Somerset, haunted sisters, Traveller lore and witchcraft. Read it as Borisov waves goodbye to our solar system, on its long, lonely haul back into interstellar darkness.• Revenger by Alastair Reynolds is published by Gollancz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec63dab0035c7e865bed6c6fccf4c47d90bd3da/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=888eeadae98f262ea98d4e5ec15f0d35","title":"labour free basic services free stuff society","story":"Ignore the cynics. Labour’s pledges on basic public services show the way towards a fairer, more efficient society“Do you accept that a lot of this free stuff that you’re talking about, it sort of reeks of desperation?”That question was put to Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Radio 4’s World at One earlier this week. And it has become a typical response to the party’s raft of policies on issues ranging from adult social care to tuition fees, train fares to broadband.Voices from the political centre have objected that the manifesto is “packed with freebies”, and there have been japes about what other ridiculous things might be free next. Some have wondered why a government should make free to everyone services that many can afford, or asked why utilities such as broadband should be paid for through tax. This seeps through into society, aided by our post-austerity cynicism about government spending and, by extension, public services.What we’re seeing here is a conflict between two different ways of thinking about how the state should function. The “free-stuff” scoffers see state spending as a means-tested safety net to catch society’s disadvantaged. But the Labour manifesto is premised on the concept that society in general is elevated when the state provides a minimum for everyone. Policy people have termed this “universal basic services”, which sounds a bit wonkish. Let us, for the greater good, call this approach “universalism”.Hostility to a universalist provision of life’s basics hasn’t always been with us. While Labour’s postwar Clement Attlee government built much of the welfare state, the ideas guiding it surfaced decades earlier. Sidney Webb, co-author of the party’s socialist clause IV (dropped by New Labour), explained in a 1918 pamphlet that Labour should pursue “the universal enforcement of a national minimum” of services – the “requisites of healthy life and worthy citizenship”. Political consensus over pooling resources for the common good, regardless of ability to pay, anchored cross-party support for the welfare state, the NHS, schools and public housing – until Margaret Thatcher’s neoliberal wrecking ball crashed into society in the 1980s.Her government’s belief that the market should allocate resources, while the state should exist only to protect those markets, gained traction in the 1990s and ended up underwriting a lot of New Labour’s approach. The shift was from universality to conditionality – in the slogan of the time, “no rights without responsibilities”. Taking responsibility for basics previously understood to be provided by the state was reconceived as unburdening the treasury – and, therefore, a social good. Which is why centrists, through the prevailing wisdom of recent decades, view unconditional access to basic services as regressive – effectively a subsidy for the rich.This is what’s driving many negative assessments of “free stuff”. “We are standing 30 or 40 years of received wisdom on its head,” says Andrew Percy, at UCL’s Institute for Global Prosperity, which inspired Labour’s revived embrace of universal services. As Percy points out, countries across Europe already have expanded universalism: free childcare from six weeks is offered to all families in the Netherlands elderly people in Belgium and Sweden have access to free social care.But in the UK the arguments grounding this approach have to be made afresh. And they go like this: universal provision is more efficient, better quality, less stigmatising and builds social participation, while tackling poverty and hardship. Also, wealthier people won’t be getting “free stuff” – they will simply be paying for it through taxes instead. Crucially, it can also enable the changes required to tackle the climate emergency: universal bus passes, for instance, could reduce pollution as well as congestion, while spreading the social glue of everyday contact.Advocates of universalism are finding they need to reintroduce its principles into the public conversation. “The language and the confidence in it has gone,” says Anna Coote of the New Economics Foundation. “If I talk about the collective ideal, it sounds old-fashioned and strange.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, often talks about collectivism and helping each other – which may sound arcane to some precisely because it hasn’t had much parliamentary currency since the 1970s (conversely, the language is refreshingly appealing to younger people because they are so unused to hearing it in politics).But today’s universalism is not a hark-back to clunky, unwieldy, centralised state provision. Instead, the idea is that the state covers costs and ensures standards, but allows design and delivery to be done at local level. European examples from Barcelona to Ghent, Belgium show how authorities can enable cooperatives and other community-led organisations in the provision of social initiatives and amenities. McDonnell’s embrace of a “decentralised” approach to state provision shows that Labour has caught up with this thinking.A decade of austerity has savaged our public services: UN envoy Philip Alston reported last year that Britain’s shocking levels of poverty were the result of policies that “deliberately gutted” public services. Meanwhile, polling suggests that people are willing to pay more tax to increase spending on health and education. There is public appetite and need for state-provided services. We just need to remember the universalism on which such policies are built.• Rachel Shabi is a writer and broadcaster.

Come summer, Alberta’s five national parks become the perfect backdrop for everything from wildlife spotting, cycling and rock climbing to rafting and gazing at the stars in one of the region’s dark sky preserves. But beyond the mountains, you’ll find both small-town charm, such as Lake Louise inside Banff National Park, and cosmopolitan buzz in Alberta’s urban hubs, Calgary and Edmonton.Besides the mountains, the province’s other great natural feature is its prairies. Alberta is cowboy country, and that means beef – namely Alberta’s famous AAA beef – is a staple of menus across the province. Head to the Longview Steakhouse, where the setting is casual but the food hearty and high-end, for a quintessentially Albertan experience with valley views. Or dine amid the forest at Tekarra. This log cabin, perched above the Athabasca River near Jasper, has been serving illustrious patrons, including Marilyn Monroe, since 1952.A new star in the contemporary culinary scene is Deane House. Set in a century-old Calgary mansion, dishes focus on seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Or tuck into the tastiest trattoria-style food at Bread \u0026amp Circus, nominated as one of Canada’s best new restaurants in 2018. And if you want to buy produce, you’re in luck – Edmontonians love a farmers’ market, with no less than 16 held weekly during the summer.It’s not just the restaurants making the most of locally sourced ingredients craft beer and spirits are booming, as entrepreneurs also make use of Alberta’s natural larder. Head to the Park Distillery in Banff for the aptly named Glacier Rye whisky, made with glacier water from Banff National Park. The multi-award-winning Eau Claire – makers of Alberta’s first craft single malt whisky – uses ingredients harvested from farms in southern Alberta.Edmonton’s nickname as “festival city” is well-earned. No matter the season, there’s a festival in town. The Edmonton International Fringe Festival – the largest, longest running fringe festival in North America – is held each August. Watch the streets of Old Strathcona fill with performers, from circus acts to standup comedians. Calgary, too, is no slouch when it comes to getting into the party spirit – it even has its own Music Mile, a mile-long stretch of 9th Avenue SE bursting with music venues, including the Ironwood Stage and Studio Bell, home of the National Music Centre. But long before there was a city here in Alberta, bison roamed, and First Nations people lived off the land. Take in 6,000 years of plains culture at the evocatively and aptly named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump cliff. The Unesco world heritage site, 14 miles west of Fort Macleod, was an important hunting site for First Nations communities. Today a visitor centre houses prehistoric artefacts and offers tours of the site.A tri-area lift ticket gets you access to Mount Norquay, Lake Louise Ski Resort and Sunshine Village – revered by skiers and boarders worldwide as one of the top places in the world to seek out feather-light snow. For the more adventurous, Fortress Mountain, located on the Kananaskis Trail, 70 miles west of Calgary, offers skiers and riders of intermediate-plus level the chance to go in search of virgin snow. Head to Castle Mountain to go cat-skiing, where you’ll have access to untouched powder so dry and light it’s nicknamed “liquid smoke”.If you’re after a more tranquil experience, take to the water in summer. Rent a canoe or kayak in Banff National Park and explore the waterways of the Bow Valley, including 40 Mile Creek and Vermilion Lakes. Or ride the backcountry mountain trails on horseback, camping out in the wilderness with a riding holiday.Alberta’s ski-heaven winters and fine summers may draw the crowds, but make no mistake, one of the best times to visit is autumn. Take a hike up to Larch Valley in late September, starting at the unbelievably photogenic Moraine Lake , to see the trees turn a flaming yellow amid the wisps of the season’s first snow. The two-and-a-half-mile hike will take you from the spectacular turquoise waters backed by the ice-capped Valley of Ten Peaks, up to a high alpine meadow. Then there’s stargazing in Jasper, where you’ll find one of the world’s largest dark sky preserves. Every October, the Dark Sky Festival holds a number of events from symphonies under the stars to rocket building workshops.Of course, winter is magical in the Rockies. And that’s not just because of the skiing: stave off the January blues in Banff with the 11-day long Snow Days Festival, centred around massive snow sculptures in downtown Banff. Or head to Lake Louise for the Ice Magic Festival, as international ice-carving teams compete to create giant sculptures on the frozen lake.Discover more adventures throughout the year in Alberta with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

Marcus Rashford grinds to a halt. Old Trafford pauses with him. Rashford waits. There’s a wiggle of the toes. And then the explosion.Rashford’s second goal against Tottenham on Wednesday night was, in many ways, a distillation of everything he does best. As Serge Aurier closed him down on the left flank, Rashford paused for an instant, waiting for his opponent to commit. A twitch of the boot was enough to convince Aurier that Rashford was planning to cut inside. And in that moment, with a conjuror’s cunning, Rashford was away: knocking the ball through Aurier’s legs, sprinting past him, burning around the outside of Moussa Sissoko – himself an exceptionally quick player – and eventually drawing the foul from which he would convert United’s winning penalty.The pledge, the turn, the prestige. It was a goal of raw athleticism and outrageous smarts, of skill and patience and pure, facetious mastery. The penalty was Rashford’s second goal of the evening, having peppered Paulo Gazzaniga with shots all night, and as United moved back into the top six for the first time since September, the consensus appeared to be that Rashford, with 12 goals in his last 13 games for club and country, is on the verge of something. The question, as he prepares to step out at the Etihad Stadium for the 179th Manchester derby, is what.This will be Rashford’s eighth Manchester derby and he is yet to produce a display to match the impact of his first, in 2016, when he marked a 1-0 United win at the Etihad with the only goal of the game. Nevertheless he is a player for the big occasion: 17 of his 36 Premier League goals have come against City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal and Leicester, by common consent United’s six strongest opponents. Whatever the opposite of a flat-track bully is, that’s Rashford.And yet, for all the talk of a breakthrough – he’s never scored more than 10 league goals in a season and currently has nine – this is a campaign that has only recently kicked into life. For the first two months of the season Rashford’s vague listlessness seemed to mirror United’s. At one point he went on a run of one goal in 12 games.This remains, in many ways, the hit on Rashford: a tendency towards inconsistency, curious lapses in focus, a paucity of options for breaking down deep-set defences. What is interesting is that these were exactly the same criticisms being levelled at one of his opponents on Saturday evening.Rashford turned 22 just over a month ago. Raheem Sterling turns 24 on Sunday, and provides a salutary lesson in how a promising young player propels himself to the next level. When Sterling was the age Rashford is now, he had scored 23 goals in 114 league games – a rate of roughly one in five – and won nothing except the League Cup. Ever since, 51 in 126 – a rate of two in five – and two Premier League titles. The pressing issue is whether Rashford’s purple patch is just that or the beginnings of a Sterling-esque metamorphosis that will see him convert his rich, base-metal promise into reliable, trophy-winning excellence.Of course, the comparison is not a perfect one. Rashford and Sterling may both cut in off the left flank with pace, sharp one-twos and a keen nose for goal, but they are subtly different in many ways. Rashford is taller and stronger than Sterling, a better header of the ball, possesses a cleaner and more powerful shot and a more reliable set piece. In virtually every other area, however, you would probably take Sterling over him, a testament to the way in which he has matured and honed his game over the last couple of seasons under Pep Guardiola.Can Rashford grow in the same way under Ole Gunnar Solskjær that Sterling has under Guardiola? It’s not a process we should assume he can undertake on his own: players do not simply develop automatically, like house plants left in a sunny window. Sterling owes his improvement not only to his ferocious work ethic but to the little details and snatches of advice that make the good players great: when to take on his man and when to recycle, timing and positioning, composure, whether to trap a ball with the outside of a foot or take it in his stride.Rashford, meanwhile, is still a player who owes his goals to intuition and inidual flourishes as much as careful plotting. This, perhaps, explains why his record is so good against better teams, where space is more plentiful, counterattacks a more useful tactic and games far more likely to turn on a single moment of brilliance. But it also highlights the biggest area of opportunity in his game: movement, reading buildup, finding himself in the positions to score the ugly goals that have swollen Sterling’s output.Will he get that sort of help at United? Solskjær’s comments after the Tottenham game, underlining Rashford’s “courage” and “directness”, describing him like a striker who looked as if he were “in the playground with his mates”, suggested he sees Rashford’s gift in largely discrete, inidualistic terms rather than as part of a more cultivated development. In short: he is good and, if he is happy, he’ll carry on being good. The hope is that behind closed doors, Solskjær is offering Rashford the sort of bespoke insights that made him himself such a devilishly shrewd striker.And perhaps the wider moral here is one of patience. Sterling did not suddenly start banging them in as soon as he turned 22: improvement came in stages, by degrees, a slow melting of potential. Likewise Rashford is a striker who has spent much of his career in a struggling team, oscillating between the No 9 and the left-wing position, and who, despite playing more than 100 league games, is a month younger than Tammy Abraham.No player’s career goes in a straight line. And for any footballer of great promise there’s a point just before the big explosion, just before he takes the plunge, when nothing very much seems to be happening. A shimmy here, a shimmy there. You wonder which way he’s going to go. And for a moment all is stillness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40e29ae27e23b5e209ac8697db8d99b0d3a28599/310_215_3268_1962/master/3268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3631e8fd430e41364900cfcdbe2c1aee","title":"sam kerr the best player in the world tell us something we dont know","story":"Judged this week by the  as the best female footballer on the planet, Matildas captain Sam Kerr now has her chance to prove it on the European club stageAcross all the years I’ve watched Sam Kerr play football, there’s one moment that stands out as a true illustration of her character, as an example of why she’s been voted ’s Best Female Footballer of 2019.It’s not a goal, or a back-flip celebration, or a gesture of kindness towards a fan. It’s a moment of failure. One of the biggest in her career, perhaps, and one that feels more significant in hindsight.In July, at the Allianz Riviera stadium in Nice, Australia were knocked out of the World Cup by Norway. Kerr, whose name had become synonymous with goal scoring in the months leading into the tournament, had missed the Matildas’ first penalty. Her teammates soon followed, their shootout plan collapsing like a sandcastle whose foundations had crumbled and slid away beneath them.The moment I remember, though, came fifteen minutes later. The stadium had largely emptied except for a few hundred Australia fans who’d gathered near the sideline to applaud their players, some of whom were farewelling their World Cup journeys for the last time.But Kerr didn’t join them. She sat alone out in the middle of the pitch, her knees pulled up to her chest, her head hidden from view. She was the shape of defeat: the hunched, exhausted shoulders of someone who had been carrying something heavy for years, who’d done all she could but realised it still wasn’t enough.That moment flooded back to me when Chelsea FC announced they’d signed Kerr on a two-and-a-half-year deal, likely making her the most expensive female footballer ever. And that announcement came while this failure was still fresh in our memories, when the eyes of the world were trained upon her and she’d fallen short, both of their expectations and of her own.Sam Kerr has been The Sam Kerr of her respective teams for years. Sky Blue FC, Perth Glory, Chicago Red Stars, the Matildas — these teams have largely revolved around what the striker has offered them. Australian and American fans who’ve watched Kerr set goal-scoring records only to break them again the following season know that she has stood head-and-shoulders above most of her colleagues. But she’s had little to show for it by way of team success. Two championship finals without a trophy was her final contribution to the W-League and the NWSL before setting off for English shores.It’s this remarkable rise that has resulted in years’ worth of backlash from fans and players alike when Kerr has been snubbed by international football’s top gongs. Her omission from global football’s most coveted awards has always felt like a glitch, a flaw in the voting system itself a consequence, perhaps, of European and World Cup myopia. To the Australian and American audiences who have watched her since her meteoric rise began in 2016, Kerr has always been destined for greatness, the kind of player about whom clichés are written. She’s the big fish in the small pond, if that pond also included habitual World Cup winners and Fifa Player of the Year recipients.Europe may not be a bigger pond, but it is a different one, and one stocked with increasingly larger fish. Like her penalty in France, the whole world will be watching if she sinks or swims. And that is the point: the whole world, not just one half of it, will be watching Sam Kerr. And they’ll be watching her in her prime, in a team where she may no longer be the one relied upon to do the heavy lifting — no longer required to be The Sam Kerr. Or maybe she will. It’s as if her growing list of statistics and awards — the back-to-back Golden Boots, the MVPs, the ESPYs and Asian Player of the Years — couldn’t be believed on paper, so she had to go there and show them herself to plant herself firmly within Europe’s field of vision, almost daring them to continue ignoring her.But this acknowledgement by a leading European organisation before she’s even set foot on the continent is itself a demonstration of why she’s there: Kerr is a player who transcends the barriers that have kept women’s football clustered and on the periphery. Her top spot also signals a shift by global football’s media towards its female athletes and the systems that have kept some less visible than others. That may, in time, become her greatest contribution to the sport.For now, the team titles that have remained conspicuously elusive are now on the horizon, and the inidual awards — though she’s perhaps too modest to admit it — are suddenly, temptingly, within reach. This is a moment for a player who missed a World Cup penalty for Australia, but who is determined not to fall short of expectations again.Because she did eventually lift her head out of her hands on that pitch in Nice. She turned and gave that stadium one last, steely look before standing up and moving on. That, more than the goals or the records, showed us who Sam Kerr is: a player who now carries a great weight on her shoulders, who stumbles for a moment, but who does not allow herself to buckle. She was already one of the best footballers to ever play the game, whether she scored that penalty or not. And now, as she stands on the shore of a new era, Sam Kerr finally has her chance to prove it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc32ec63027a45a1231acedc8b5cda00170dab0/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2581d676322ee61d7b01e4dabf824544","title":"psg neymar mbappe champions league qatar glory","story":"Some things just sound better in French. See for example the above, taken from a report in Le Parisien of Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-0 home win against Nantes in midweek. This is definitely best read in the original, ideally in the sad, sonorous tones of Uncle Monty from the film Withnail and I staring wistfully out of a scullery window with a firm young carrot in one hand and a velveteen club-branded Neymar figurine in the other.Une idée, un fantasme dans nos rêves. What the man from Le Parisien is saying here, coming on like a cross between Baudelaire and a Fan TV stadium vox pop, is that PSG are in a bit of a state these days, albeit a fascinating one. This is still a winning machine. Victory on Wednesday left Thomas Tuchel’s team five points clear at the top of the table and they are already guaranteed first place in their Champions League group. Mauro Icardi and Edinson Cavani are an unusually regal pair of back-up strikers. In Idrissa Gueye and Marco Verratti they have a passing, covering midfield to die for.But something is still rotten in the state of Denmark. It is two and a half years since the most extraordinary single recruitment blitz in the history of sport. Neymar came to Paris first, snapped up in early August 2017 for a brain-mangling £198m. Kylian Mbappé followed three weeks later, in a deal rebranded, for obvious reasons, as a temp-to-perm loan. At the end of which Neymar and Mbappé have played just one (yes, one) Champions League knock-out game together in two years. Neymar missed both games against Manchester United with a foot injury last year. Before that both men played in the first leg defeat at Real Madrid, with Neymar once again injured for the decisive defeat in Paris. Fast forward to the present day and the Neymar‑Mbappé mini-era feels like it’s on the brink: caught between heaven and earth, still brilliantly high-functioning, but fragile too, and reaching the end of something.Mbappé scored the opening goal against Nantes, a clumsily, elegantly inventive little flick of the heel executed while tumbling over backwards. On 78 minutes he wandered off the pitch and sat looking sad and betrayed beneath a red blanket. A little later Neymar also ambled off looking even more broken, devastated, saddened. Neymar had just added the second goal, a penalty celebrated with a shushing gesture towards parts of a crowd that continue to boo him for trying to force a move away, and for not being Cavani.It was a significant moment in other ways. Get this. Wednesday night was also the first time Neymar and Mbappé had scored in the same game since January, 10 months during which they had spent only 120 minutes on the pitch in each other’s company. It makes for an extraordinary running total: £90m in wages since PSG’s two-man galáctico unit scored in the same game. And beyond that a combined wage and transfer bill of £570m on the pair of them.Here we have an entire half-a-billion goalscoring project based on getting these two men on the pitch together in the Champions League latter stages. At the end of which Neymar and Mbappé have played only one Champions League knockout games together in two years, the 3-1 first-leg defeat at Real Madrid in 2018. Neymar missed the return defeat in Paris with a foot injury and another ruled him out of both legs of last season’s tie against Manchester United.This situation would be more obviously comic if Mbappé and Neymar had proven to be a dysfunctional, poorly matched pair. But the truth is more subtle than that. The fact is they are great together. In 46 Neymar‑Mbappé games PSG have scored 150 goals, including 20 mutual assists. To date the real high-summer period was between September last year and January this, when they scored together in 10 games and PSG regularly racked up five or six.At which point, enter injury, stasis and unrest. It seems possible Mbappé will finally go to Madrid next summer. Neymar has been wandering around looking like a royal prince on a tour of a Victorian sewerage unit for at least the last six months. But both are now fit. From here they have a contained five-month run to make this work, to cut through all the animus, the interests, the industrial-sporting complex that follows these human talent-units around.Two things are pretty clear. Firstly, when he’s fit Mbappé is the most devastating centre-forward in the world. And secondly while he might be infuriating, an absurd sun king-ish figure, Neymar is also an amazing footballer, with a style that complements Mbappé perfectly when he dials back the showy jinks. How far can they take it now, with one more Champions League season to reach the end of this?Paris Saint-Germain: the Qatar Years may be a grisly thing in many ways. This is sport as a machine to gloss and launder the status of a wildly ambitious petro-state. You can’t kill the spirit though and PSG are a genuinely engrossing team right now, a group of players with a wonderful purity about them in those moments when football becomes just a thing on a rectangle of green, a business of shapes, angles, talent.For all the inanity and greed of the European club scene it is worth remembering that sport will still give us these defiant notes of beauty and poise. In this case, and most obviously, an attacking partnership that really does have a touch of heaven about it.• This story was corrected on 6 December 2019 to reflect the fact that Neymar did not play against Manchester United in the last 16 of the 2018-19 Champions League"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c6f734abbd75aada591d7bb928b590bcc61646/0_91_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea416a8402520544d817011665ab74ee","title":"record number of over 45s giving birth in england","story":"More than 2,000 women in this age group had babies last year, ONS figures showThe number of women aged 45 and over giving birth is at the highest level since records began 80 years ago, figures show.The number of live births in this age group rose from 1,619 a decade ago to 2,366 in 2018. In 1938, when records began, there were 2,085 births to women over 45, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Births to women aged 25 and under have steadily decreased since records began. The figures show the average age of mothers and fathers increased for the 10th successive year, rising to 30.6 and 33.6 years respectively.The standardised mean age of mothers and fathers has increased by a total of 4.2 years since they were at their lowest on record in 1975 and 1974 respectively.Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said the latest figures highlighted the “sustained and unrelenting pressures” on midwives, maternity support workers and maternity services. The risk of complications rises for expectant mothers and their babies as women get older.“Our maternity services need the resources to be able to meet this growing demand and to ensure women, babies and their families get the safest and best possible care,” Walton added.In England, maternity services gained just 33 new midwives in the past year despite a shortfall of about 2,500, according to the RCM. “This will do little to help this situation,” Walton said. “The government’s own policy changes, which we support, to tackle issues such as the entrenched inequalities in health particularly in BAME communities will also need additional investment.”Stillbirth rates are higher to women living in the most deprived areas in England. In 2018, the stillbirth rate in the most deprived areas was 5.7 stillbirths per 1,000 total births, compared with 2.7 in the least deprived areas.Walton said: “I repeat the call in our recently published election manifesto for a root and branch review of maternity services funding and resources. It is needed and it is long overdue. The government have lofty ambitions which we are behind, but they need to ensure the service has what it needs to achieve them.”The ONS figures show the number of twins, triplets and quadruplets declined for the third consecutive year. Of every 1,000 women giving birth, 15.4 had a multiple birth in 2018, which was the lowest multiple maternity rate since 2007."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c66619f82cba864922d8bda40b100e3a197133e7/782_342_1485_890/master/1485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba4f26b479f8b9ec1a9ee950202b0782","title":"anton du beke strictly dancer interview","story":"The Strictly dancer on his fear of spiders, being a door-to-door salesman, and why the police used to stop him while drivingBorn in Kent, Anton du Beke, 53, started dancing at 14.

Conventional recipes are a potential yuletide horror for dogs because raisins and sultanas are toxic for canines, prompting Britain’s two biggest supermarkets to offer dog-friendly alternatives. Tesco has also launched a range of macarons for small breed dogs, filled with mutt-friendly yoghurt.It is all a far cry from the old days when the family dog might be tossed a discarded turkey bone, and follows pet owners’ spiralling expenditure on their four-legged companions at Christmas.It follows the more general trend of cat and dog owners wanting to buy the same products for their animals as they do for themselves, extending at Christmas to pet gifting through festive stockings, accessories and outfits as well as food and treats.The pet Advent calendar market has become firmly established – and is offered by numerous retailers – since the first one was launched in the UK by Lily’s Kitchen five years ago, when it manufactured a modest 5,000. That has grown to more than 50,000 this year, shipped to nine countries across Europe, the Middle East and Asia.This week the brand got significant celebrity endorsement when Victoria Beckham released a video on Instagram showing her daughter, Harper, opening one of the company’s dog Advent calendars and handing the treats to her two cocker iels.Its new macarons are made exclusively by a family-run pet food business based near Boston, Lincolnshire, which grows the wheat that goes into pet biscuits.Helen Coxon, Tesco pet food product development manager, said: “We’ve had great success since launching our Christmas pet range with novel, humanised products that bring fun at Christmas.“This year we wanted to launch a product that is perfectly proportioned for smaller dogs as well as bringing more elegance into the range.

I chose the one that doesn’t involve going to Cornwall: an indoor surf centre, Twinwoods Adventure, near Bedford – the reason being that I’ve actually tried to learn a sport in the sea before, when I was considerably nearer to 17. The year was 2001, and I was on a kite-surfing press trip to the modish Watergate Bay. Kite-surfing is so impossible that to try and learn it from scratch was like being a toddler learning how to hurdle we spent four full days just getting on the board. By the end, I was no closer only colder. Learning indoors had to be easier, surely?My instructor, Keagan Walsh, was straight out of central casting for Home And Away. He had two bodyboards (surf boards happen later), one of which was plainly intended for me. He introduced me to a sloping slide about three metres long, with water gushing out at the bottom at incredible pressure. “OK,” he said, or at least I think he did, because I couldn’t hear anything at all. “Just jump on. It’s not cold.” Sure, not cold, but I still stood at the top giggling with fear. Once it dawned on him that I was not going to jump, he suggested I kneel at the top. I could manage that. Then, with the board against my body, elbows in, holding on to the top, I didn’t so much jump as lurch forward. Luckily, water has a grace of its own.There are so many fun ways to screw it all up: if you get the top of the board into the water before your weight is on it, it’s like being hosed in the face with a water cannon. If you forget how to steer – lean heavily on the elbow of the direction you want to go in – you’ll careen straight into the side. If you steer too aggressively towards the middle, where the water is fiercest, it will blow you straight back to the top and you’ll hit the back wall, which is not as painful as it sounds.I discovered all this over the course of 17 or 18 tries, while Keagan inaudibly tried to teach me new stuff. I attempted the Superman (let the board go, then catch it as it fires back to you) nope, not yet, maybe in six months. I tried kneeling on the board itself, a first step to standing ha, not in a million years. By this point he was looking at me quizzically, as if wondering why a person so afraid of getting wet would think surfing was for them. Or maybe he’d asked me a question and I hadn’t heard.On about my tenth go, I did learn to steer: I was so amazed at even this scintilla of control over my surroundings (having previously felt like a snooker ball, pinged across the slide by unknown forces) that I started to really love it, like a kid in a water park. I cannot think of a faster way to exhaust yourself. Maybe standing up on a horse?Belly on the board (BED), elbows in, allowing your legs to drag behind. This sounds so much easier than it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dab326842ac75e20e3bda547c9588ca9e0ae6c6/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1102268ea0f4197ce13ee930364b2e99","title":"hannah freddy blind date","story":"What were you hoping for?A flirty evening with a decent (over 6ft) guy and an opportunity to dress up fancy and get a nice ego boost.First impressions?I sent a panicked text to my friend five minutes in: “HE IS FIT, HE IS NERVOUS, HE DOES MARATHONS, BUT HE IS FIT.” I thought he was underdressed, but then I was slightly overdressed.

It is an app that aims to replicate the experience of reading the newspaper on tablets and mobile phones – a companion to our existing ‘Live’ app and which is now available to subscribers to our digital subscription bundle. The Daily digital subscription costs £11.99$19.99 USD$21.50 AUD a month, with a special 3 month trial offer of £5.99 a month, and is available to subscribe to directly from the  site.How did the new app come about? How does it differ from the existing Live apps?Juliette Laborie, our director of digital reader revenues: The Daily is the new flagship product of our digital subscription bundle and a companion to the Live app, which is geared more towards breaking news. The Daily, in contrast, is more focused, with a finite selection of curated stories for those who sometimes feel overwhelmed by the news. The Daily and Live app complement each other, so subscribers have freedom to choose how they stay informed.Caspar Llewellyn Smith, the ’s digital platforms editor: Following extensive research and conversations with readers, we saw a clear appetite for a digital product that replicates the experience of reading the newspaper. Unlike the website or app, with everything we publish, and news breaking 247, we wanted to create something you can read in one sitting or simply dip into your favourite section, say. Alex Breuer, our executive creative director: The new Daily app is an evolution of the existing editions app. Previously available only on iPad, readers can now enjoy this new experience on phones and tablets, on both iOS and Android devices.David Blishen, our group product manager for journalism: The production process for the original Daily app relied on some components that were becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. The new app has been incorporated into existing modern tools, and will we hope provide a platform for making more “edition”-based products.Why the appetite for the Daily?CLS Different readers can want different things - in fact, the same reader can want different things, depending on the time of the day or how they’re feeling. Look outside – the world is in turmoil, so it’s little surprise that readers have been turning to us in record numbers for our coverage of issues of like Brexit or the election or Trump’s impeachment. We serve that need by providing rolling coverage of world events on our website and through our Live app, using staples of digital publishing like liveblogs (which the  pioneered). There’s instant analysis – and don’t forget minute-by-minute football match reports or instant recaps of TV shows our readers love, too. But of course all that can feel overwhelming at times - so the Daily offers an antidote. It’s a very calm space, which offers you a snapshot of the  sees the world at a particular moment in time.AB The original tablet edition was released in 2011 as a digital replacement for the printed newspaper. The new Daily still mirrors the traditional “newspaper moment”, as a finite edit of the key stories of the day, but has been designed to sit alongside the other  digital platforms: there is a commonality of structure and design language.Who decides what should be included? CLS The team who edit our Daily edition take their cue from the strongest stories we have published online and in print during the previous 24 hours – from hard news to lifestyle. So it reflects the paper and website.Who can access the app and how? JL Anyone who has a smartphone or tablet on Android and iOS above iOS 12 and Android 8. It’s available globally, although of course it is published from a UK perspective and we aim it primarily to British audiences.CLS Subscribers to the digital pack, who also get our Live app, can now access this, so they have a wider choice of reading experience. DB We continue to review the devices the new app is available on: our ambition is to make it available to as many as possible.How did all the aspects of the product come together? How long did the process take?JL We’ve been thinking about it for over a year – initially in the form of a strategy we formulated last year - and then in April we began the work in earnest. CLS We have known for some time that we needed to evolve the existing app from a technical perspective to provide the best product and better suit the needs of our readers. As with all of our digital products, it was a highly collaborative approach, involving editors, software engineers, designers and user experience experts. We always try to take this approach at the . AB The design and development process was fast-paced. The range of devices and platforms we wanted to offer the experience on presented a range of technical and design challenges. We validated the first design concepts with existing Daily readers and readers of other  platforms. As work progressed we opened up early versions to readers in the from of a beta version. This was hugely valuable in guiding the team through a complex process of prioritisation.DB We had an internal prototype in three months and worked to a tight deadline to get the product into the App Store. The team was supported by our Editorial Tools development team, who handled the creation of the production tools.What are your hopes for the app? What will success look like? JL It finding its audience, managing to recreate the enjoyment of a well-edited selection of journalism in a digitally native setting, with beautiful images and a great reading experience.We also want to explore similar products in different territories: the US and Australia, and others, thanks to the tools and software we have built to support the Daily.DB The platform that creates the edition is versatile and I hope we can produce a range of products with it. However, our attention at the moment is working on the feedback of the existing Daily users who have highlighted areas for improvement that we’re actively trying to address.How does this fit in with the ’s reader-funded strategy?CLS We are delighted that so many readers have decided to support us over recent years, and we know that different products suit different readers in different territories, so we try to provide a set of great options.What has initial reaction been?CLS It has been very well received and, as always, we have been listening carefully to user feedback with a view to making changes and further improvements. In this instance, we heard from readers that they’d like the Daily edition to do some different things, so the latest edition includes a better offline reading experience, the ability to read the whole edition swiping from article to article, automatic download, more flexibility around the ability to manage editions, and we intend to roll it out with further changes in due course.Some loyal iPad users have said they preferred the old app, so we are working through all of their feedback and seeing how we can retain the best of the old app within something that is both much more solid in technical terms and designed as a modern, fresh-feeling, daily edition of the .AB We knew that our bold ambition of satisfying existing loyal readers and inspiring new readers would elicit a broad range of views. Over the next few releases, readers will see a mix of new and familiar features arrive – evolutions to galleries, navigation and layout are a few of them. One of the core technical advantages of the new Daily app is that we are able to add and improve the experience with a pace that we would have struggled to match with the previous version.What’s next for your team? CLS We’d like to see a growing number of satisfied Daily edition readers across the UK, and in the coming weeks and months we’ll be testing the appetite for more localised versions in the US and Australia, and then audiences elsewhere. DB The existing edition keys off the newspaper: for future editions we’re looking at what content editors promote most across the site and using that as the basis for suggesting what should be included."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce593bc924c82650bff58f46abe5ebb0dd7b6f9/0_258_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab86e0215add5cc5da02636474055a9d","title":"can you ask family to contribute financially at christmas","story":"My brother and his partner always come to us and we’re wondering if it’s fair to ask them to chip inEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.My brother and his partner (in their early 30s) live in a one-bed flat and never host the family Christmas – they always come to us.

So if they retired in the mid-1990s and are still alive, they receive a UK state pension of about £58 a week, while those who went to Jamaica pick up £129 a week.The way Britain pays state pensions to those who retire abroad is weirdly capricious. There are 134,000 retirees in the US now entitled to a UK state pension after paying their contributions here, and they enjoy annual increases. But across the border in Canada, there are 135,000 UK state pensioners – and they receive no increases at all.Three years ago, we highlighted the case of Joe Lewis, a 90-year-old former RAF veteran. His state pension was frozen at £48 a week after he retired to Canada. Like hundreds of thousands of other pensioners in his position, he faced serious hardship in old age.There are 234,000 UK pensioners in Australia, and 65,000 in New Zealand, who receive no increases. But the 132,000 in Ireland and 106,000 in Spain enjoy annual rises.Official DWP figures in 2018 revealed there are 527,000 British pensioners living in countries where their basic state pension is not uprated annually. It is discriminatory and inhumane. As one daughter of the Windrush generation told us this week: “There seems to be no logic – it’s discriminatory and prejudice. The people most affected by this are rarely qualified to fight the injustice, and of my parents’ generation, too many just ‘put up with it’ and don’t want to ‘rock the boat’, so accept the status quo.”The Conservatives have been persistently cloth-eared to their plight. The reason? It will cost £500m extra a year if all pensions in payment were increased to current levels, said the then pensions minister, Guy Opperman, in 2018.It’s shameful how the Tories have ignored these pensioners, and disappointing that Labour won’t extend a fuller guarantee. Yet when it comes to state pensions, Labour has contrived to find £58bn – equal to half a year’s entire spending on the NHS – to fund the rather less convincing claims of the Waspi (Women against state pension increases) group, who now go under the name Back to 60.Well-off women such as Theresa May would receive a freebie from Labour worth £22,000. It will result in grotesque inequalities – a manual male labourer, aged 59 and earning £20,000 a year, would have to toil until 66 to obtain a state pension. His older sister, aged 63, would receive a £24,000 payout from Labour, although she is comfortably off already. They are a real family I know well. The historical injustice of state pensions has always been the fact that men had to wait until 65, while women received theirs at 60 – and then lived longer. Equality in state pensions has taken far too long to achieve, but at least we are on that path. The same cannot be said about the arbitrary way we treat our pensioners abroad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c77458f553f25fa86a64e317940a017cd793d5/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b61f645c1f74fd3f572198eb26778a2","title":"i lost my 193000 inheritance with one wrong digit on my sort code","story":"Peter Teich sent his cash to another Barclays customer, but offered it him just £25 as a token gestureIt is the stuff of financial nightmares. You get one digit wrong on the sort code, and send a huge amount of cash to the wrong person. They refuse to return it, and the bank washes its hands of the matter, blaming you for the mistake.That’s what happened to Peter Teich in a case that reveals shocking lapses in Britain’s banking system. Just hours after a solicitor sent the Cambridge resident his £193,000 inheritance after the death of his 100-year-old father, it became apparent that a terrible mistake had been made.Teich had given his correct name, address and Barclays account number in Cambridge to his solicitor – but the wrong sort code. The money went straight to another Barclays customer, also in the Cambridge area who, alarmingly, had an account with the same number as Teich, though a slightly different sort code. Worse, the person refused to return the money. Barclays knew where his £193,000 was sitting and, Teich says, knew when the recipient dishonestly began to withdraw the cash.From the end of March next year, name checks will be carried out when UK bank customers send money to other people.The move is designed to tackle the rapidly-growing problem of bank transfer fraud. But there has been criticism of the fact that it has been delayed – it was originally set to start last summer, according to reports.At the moment, anyone wanting to transfer money is asked for the recipient’s account name, account number and sort code. However, it’s typically the case that the bank does not check if the account name is correct.The so-called “confirmation of payee” system that is being introduced from 31 March 2020 will mean customers can check they are paying the right person. When a customer sets up a new payment, their bank etc will be able to check the name of the person or organisation they intend to pay against the actual name held on the account.There will be three possible outcomes. If they used the correct account name, they will receive confirmation that the details match, and can proceed with the payment.If they used a similar name to the account holder, they will be provided with the actual name to check. They can then update the details and try again, or contact the intended recipient to check the details.But if the customer enters the wrong name for the account holder, they will be told the details do not match and advised to contact the person they are trying to pay.The mistaken transfer – called “misapplied funds” in banking parlance – could not have occurred if UK banks matched up sort codes and account numbers with the account holder’s name. But they do not. A recipient’s name could be given as Mickey Mouse and the bank would still process the payment, using the sort code and account number alone.The banking industry promised that from mid-2019 name checks would be carried out when customers sent money to other people, largely to halt a rising tide of bank transfer fraud. But the timetable was delayed, and it will now not come into force until the end of March next year.An oddity in Teich’s case is that Barclays also appeared to have identical account numbers for two different customers, both in the Cambridge area.Teich realised the error almost immediately. His father’s estate was ided with his sister, who emailed him at noon on the day of the transfer, 26 April, to say she had received her £193,000. Teich checked his account, found nothing there, and contacted his solicitor. Only then did he discover he had given the solicitor the wrong sort code. The solicitor immediately contacted Barclays, which said the money would be restored within a week, according to Teich. But in late May, Teich received a bombshell letter from Barclays: “Due to an error on your part, the funds were applied to another customer … clearly you were mis-advised about the funds being restored to your account, and in recognition of this, I have credited your account with a small token gesture of £25.”Barclays said it asked the person who received the cash for permission to return the money, but he refused. In a letter a few days later to Teich’s solicitor, it said: “Regrettably we have not been able to gain permission from the recipient of these funds for them to be returned to you. As there has been no error here on the part of the bank, we cannot just simply return the funds.”No one is legally entitled to keep money that has been wrongfully credited to their account. But compelling them to return the money, particularly if it is spent, is another matter. Barclays, in common with other banks, will not even provide the name of the person who has received the cash, unless it is instructed by a court.Some  readers may recognise Teich’s surname, as his father, Mikuláš – from whom he inherited the £193,000 – was the subject of an obituary in the paper in April. Mikuláš escaped from Nazi-held Czechoslovakia in 1939, although his parents perished in the Holocaust. He later became a renowned historian of science at Cambridge.Despite being 74 and disabled, Peter Teich was left on his own to recover his father’s £193,000. “Barclays insisted that I bear the full and sole responsibility of pursuing their own dishonest customer,” he says. He hired lawyers and went through an expensive and laborious two-stage legal process. In June, after £12,000 in legal and court fees, he got the other Barclays customer’s name. Armed with this, he then went to the high court to obtain a freezing injunction – at a cost of £34,000. Finally, after an “unnecessary, expensive and stressful process”, the court order forced the other Barclays customer to repay the cash.“I freely acknowledge my mistake in this unhappy saga: I provided the sort code of the wrong Barclays branch. But my error fades into near insignificance when considered in the context of Barclays’ conduct,” says Teich.The saga did not stop there. Teich asked Barclays to refund the £46,000 in legal costs he racked up simply to recover his own money. Barclays refused. Angered by the bank’s reply, Teich contacted the  for help. We asked it to reconsider his case, and in an almost immediate U-turn, it has now agreed to pay all his legal fees, and has offered him £750 in compensation.In a statement the bank said: “It is evident that on this occasion we have failed to meet the high standards that Mr Teich can expect to receive from Barclays, and for this we have offered our sincere apologies. After taking a closer look at this situation, we can confirm that Mr Teich can expect the fees he has incurred to be refunded in full with interest, together with a payment for the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused.”Teich is jubilant he will now no longer be out of pocket. But he regrets Barclays’ behaviour. “It could have taken Barclays a few days to recover the misdirected funds, but instead they did nothing. They could have saved me and everyone else all this stress and anxiety. Had the confirmation of payee measures been in place at the time of the transfer, I would not have gone through the costly process of recovering my funds. All the same, Barclays could have done the right thing and intervened when there was still time to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab026acf25020029c6893a893c911603f8f7f32f/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=747c0a603ca9ad3cc82d15afb159ef90","title":"the insurer wont pay our claim because our teenager had acne","story":"A family struggled to get a refund after they were forced to abandon a holiday when their son was diagnosed with hepatitisA London couple who were forced to cancel a trip to Uganda after their son was unexpectedly diagnosed with hepatitis have described their incredulity after InsureandGo refused their £1,440 cancellation claim because he had a pre-existing condition: teenage acne.Tom Bennett* and family say InsureandGo, one of the biggest travel insurers, used a clause buried in its terms and conditions to say that because he was being treated for the skin condition before they bought the policy, it won’t pay the cancellation claim. The trip was cancelled because of the hepatitis, which had not been diagnosed before they bought the insurance.After taking several further weeks to re-examine the case, InsureandGo told Money it stands by the decision. It said paying out “would be highly unethical and unfair to other customers”.The Bennetts had hoped to spend August on a two-week independent tour of Uganda. After making several bookings, including the flights, in June, they did the prudent thing, and bought an InsureandGo “silver” travel policy. Tom was meticulous in filling in the application form, disclosing a pre-existing cardiovascular condition, and the cost was adjusted upwards to £110.“In April our son, who was to join us on the trip, had seen the dermatology team in our local hospital to explore a potential treatment for his acne. Further tests followed, but there was no indication that anything serious was wrong – until late July, when a liver biopsy was carried out, and he was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. This meant he had to be admitted to hospital immediately and the trip was off,” says Tom.Most of the hotel and other bookings were cancellable, he says, but the £1,440 cost of the flights was not, so they claimed. But after waiting over 10 weeks for it to be processed, it was denied.InsureandGo, part of the giant Mapfre group in Spain, had used a term in the policy that excluded any medical claim if anyone covered was “receiving or waiting for any medical tests or treatment for any medical condition or set of symptoms that have not been diagnosed”.In September, it reported global revenues of £18.6bn for the first nine months of 2019, with profits of £330m.“Obviously, at no stage when we bought the policy did we expect there to be anything seriously wrong with our son. We would not have carried on planning, booked hotels, laid out the route, applied for visas etc. The wording is so deliberately vague it gives the company the right to reject payment under just about every possible scenario. Buying this insurance was so pointless, we might as well have thrown the money out of the window,” he says.Robert Vines, also from London, contacted  Money after spending over two months trying to get InsureandGo to pay his claim. He and his wife had been on a Turkish holiday in August when she collapsed and was rushed to hospital. After a series of tests she was given medication for hypertension. He paid the bill, but says he’s been battling ever since to get back his £2,300.“In October they informed me that they had received all the necessary information and that I would hear in a couple of working days. I have spoken to them on six further occasions but nothing ever happens. I feel they are just doing everything they can not to hand over the money,” he says.After our intervention he was paid, and the firm apologised for the delay. It has also refunded him the £150 excess it had deducted.In 2015 we reported on the case of Joe Greensmith, from Lowestoft who was forced to borrow £3,000 to pay for a life-saving treatment in Hanoi. InsureandGo had refused to pay for the treatment, claiming his problems stemmed from a pre-existing condition. It refunded him after the  intervened.Last year InsureandGo refused to pay Philip Jenkins from Wales after the “beast from the east” dumped so much snow on his village that he couldn’t physically get to Bristol airport to start a ski trip. It said he wasn’t covered. After a year, the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) decided he was, and awarded him more than £830. “Don’t give up on your claim … this is exactly what they hope you will do,” he wrote.InsureandGo says: “The terms of our policy, and those of most other travel insurance policies, make it clear we can’t provide cover for a claim if it relates to anything the customer was aware of before taking out the policy, unless it was declared and accepted by us. For this reason we’re unable to cover the cost of Mr Bennett’s cancelled air fare.”It is expected the Bennetts will have to take their case to the FOS.* Not his real nameEmail your experience of claiming on an InsureandGo policy – good or bad – to consumer.champions@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa22653aa4c2813613611c50d0e63c188a8f552/0_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cfa7762f75beec1a808b0a574bb253","title":"election 2019 inside momentum podcast","story":"Anushka Asthana reports from inside Momentum, the grassroots movement hoping to propel Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street.

She was the UK’s ambassador to Georgia for three years until 2016, and was head of the Foreign Office human rights department. She also served in Bangkok, New Delhi and Bogotá. She was seconded to the US state department from 2002 to 2004, working on promotion of human rights and democracy in the Middle East.She was still working at the embassy on Friday, but is due to leave in the week before Christmas. She is married to the American head of the International Republican Institute, Daniel Twining.“She was really good at her job and really well respected around town,” said a source who had frequent dealings with Hall Hall over Brexit and its consequences. “She has done everything right, and has had legitimate concerns. This is not something that has just developed in the past week or two. It dates back, but I had the impression her concerns were being dealt with internally. I am surprised it has come to this.”A foreign office spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on the detail of an inidual’s resignation.”After her posting in Tbilisi, Hall Hall had taken a break from government, moving to Washington to become a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, where her writing focused on the need for western solidarity in the face of Vladimir Putin’s expansionism. But last year, she took the Brexit counsellor job at the embassy.“She was a Remainer, but she told me that at the end of the day she supported her country and her government and she saw the role as crucial to making a success of the transition,” a former colleague recalled.Daniel Fried, a former US assistant secretary of state for Europe, said: “Ambassador Hall Hall is known to her US colleagues, myself included, as a person of integrity and insight. I cannot comment on the specifics of her charges, but she is a credible and serious person and as such her words carry weight.”Nile Gardiner, director for the Margaret Thatcher Centre for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said: “It is very, very disappointing to see a British diplomat not implementing the official policy of their government.”“Diplomats should not be giving their own interpretation of information provided by their own government,” Gardiner added.The UK embassy has been without an ambassador since July, when Kim Darroch resigned following the leak of internal foreign office cables in which he described the Trump administration as dysfunctional, faction-riven and inept. The nomination of a successor has been delayed by political turmoil in Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f4521e0f348a9dcf02a931245c872bc7fc0f98/431_40_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d37aa50e5f68af1555c3968c67905212","title":"frankie boyle election countdown praying prorogue next parliament","story":"From a Dickensian Tory cabinet to the ghosts of Brexit promises past, the comedian brings you his take on the electionAs the body politic convulses, as the abyss avoids our gaze, we near the end of another election at the behest of a political class that has paid as much attention to David Cameron’s fixed terms as he did to people with emphysema slowly dying over a wood lathe. Christmas seems a strange time for a Tory government to call an election possibly they guessed that it would be hard for Labour to sell hope in winter possibly they judged that goodwill to all men would be at its lowest after people had endured a December of accidentally answering the door to a canvasser because they thought it was an Amazon package. Then again, Conservatives would say that the story of Christmas chimes with their values, as it involves a pregnant refugee being treated quite badly.Let’s begin with the Tories. The cabinet is Dickensian in the purest sense: the sort of people who would need more than two ghosts to change their behaviour. After an uncertain start, Jacob Rees-Mogg has had a pretty good campaign, onboard an Arctic clipper ship, nailed into a coffin of earth from his constituency. It’s interesting that someone who thinks ordinary people lack common sense is so heavily invested in upholding the result of a referendum, but like so many lesser ironies in this election, we simply don’t have the time. When people say “The mask has slipped!” after various cabinet gaffes, there must be a moment when the minister wonders whether they have accidentally come out wearing one of the actual masks they wear to the various Eyes Wide Shut-style parties that dot their social calendar at this time of year their fingers moving reflexively towards their face to see if they’ve worn the head of a golden ibis to talk to Phillip Schofield.The Conservatives seem to have focused on the phrase “Get Brexit Done”, which has all the conviction of your dad hitting the arms of his chair and saying, “Right…” We also seem to be hearing a lot about “Unleashing Britain’s potential”, despite most of our potential being for food riots, and perhaps some kind of race war. The Conservative manifesto contains elements of both Thatcherism and Reaganism, in that it seems to have been written by someone with dementia. There was probably a discussion about whether to release a manifesto at all or simply airdrop scratchcards over key marginals.Boris Johnson, who looks like something you’d keep your pyjamas in, and who no reasonable person would choose to lead them into a chorus, has a strangely hunched demeanour perhaps from all the time he spends crammed inside married women’s wardrobes, like a randy jack-in-the-box. This confused sex yeti has been booed by nurses: people who can remove a dressing, examine a festering wound, and still look up at you with a smile. Has any party ever elected a new leader so tired and dated? With a delivery best approximated as a living checklist of stroke warnings, his bumbling posho shtick almost resembles buffering, a kind of 3G Wodehouse. He doesn’t even seem to enjoy it throughout the campaign he’s sported a face that looks as if it’s been kneaded by a baker going through a particularly bitter orce, and the irony that comes into his eyes every time he crowbars in a catchphrase means that he breaks the fourth wall more than Deadpool. We thought the office of prime minister was what he lived for, his consuming ambition. It’s all been a bit like hearing Tony The Tiger talk about his diabetes.Johnson’s deep investment in democracy is highlighted by the fact that his government has been dominated by an unelected special adviser. Usually people with levels of mental activity as low as Johnson’s aren’t surrounded by advisers, but their weeping parents and a member of their favourite boy band. Dominic Cummings looks like he works in television (which I think might be the worst thing you can say about anyone), has the air of a startled testicle, and the name of a character in a porn parody of The Talented Mr Ripley (“The Talentless Fister Ripped Me”). Everyone who’s bored with Johnson pretending to be an idiot should look at Cummings and realise these people are far more dangerous when they pretend to be clever.It’s perfectly obvious why Johnson has been able to take power: he has an instinctive grasp on Brexit as rightwing eschatology, and he’s used to getting his own way, be it in the halls of Westminster or elbowing siblings off of nanny’s nipples. It’s only when you look at the hideous Tarot formed by his cabinet that you get a true picture of the depravity into which we are sinking. Take Michael Gove, a revanchist endorsement of the science of physiognomy. In any other era Gove would be seen as a uniquely unctuous, unlikable and profoundly talentless figure. Now he’s hardly even remarkable. Gove – looking like someone took all the flesh out of a serial killer’s drains and forced it into some brogues like Davros fell out of his Dalek like a rushed cartoon of a horny snail – is somehow not the worst person in cabinet, or even his own marriage. Against pushback from Sajid Javid and Priti Patel, Dominic Raab is attempting to get up to 60 British children back from camps in northern Syria before they freeze to death over the winter. That Raab, the flesh suit of a sentient virus with a forehead vein like a B\u0026ampB kettle-cord, is somehow the moral heart of this enterprise tells you all you need to know. In all likelihood, you’ll be praying that they prorogue the next parliament.Someone else who will still be here after the Rapture is the Brexit party’s Nigel Farage. I thought one of the advantages of the Brexit vote was that he might disappear having him back in public life is a bit like watching a suicide bomber doing a comeback tour. Of course, it would have been nice to see him actually running in the election, particularly from a pack of wild dogs. As for the Lib Dems – well, I thought we’d really miss Tim Farron, bumping around the country on a deserted coach and performing Blue Peter tasks in front of people terrified that he might start talking about gay sex. Jo Swinson has grown on me, and seems to exist as a satisfying, subtle and damning satire of humanity. Swinson’s election started out relatively positively, possibly because people hadn’t heard her speak yet. It quickly became clear that she had the gravitas of a re-education camp supply teacher, and was launching a kind of charm retreat that seemed to involve loans for renting flats and permanent austerity. Some might see misogyny in this reaction to her, but I’m fairly sure I just hate her for being from Milngavie.Labour’s idea to run an election campaign on policy in the middle of all this is a little bit like reciting your poetry at an orgy. Jeremy Corbyn, perhaps weighing up whether he could have more influence by simply dying and haunting his successor, has benefitted from becoming slightly calmer over the course of the campaign. Aggression isn’t a good look for him, shifting Corbyn from Rabbit in Winnie the Pooh towards the territory where you’d expect his face to be captioned with “police suspect the real figure may be much higher”. Labour’s campaign initially struggled to find the right note of warmth or optimism. Normally in a general election, there’s so little mention of Scotland it’s like watching coverage of a major football tournament, but Labour seemed pointlessly determined to get across the message that they would deny a second independence referendum. The Corbyn project started out as a piece of moralising – a token candidate standing in a Labour leadership election to remind the party of its principles – and his Labour is at its weakest when these roots show: it can come across as patronising and entitled. I think Labour presents itself better during elections because it is forced to be more practical. The whole Corbyn thing, at its best, is a sort of Ealing comedy about some old bloke who gets called off his allotment to try to form a government, but it needs to promise a third act where something actually happens. Labour’s campaign also demonstrates the limits of social media compared with establishment media power. If polls at the time of writing are to be believed, owning several TV stations and newspapers still seems to be more important than the democratisation of the ability to troll celebrity Jews.Before the campaign, there seemed to be a belief among Labour party members that it fared better in elections because of rules about electoral media balance, perhaps because they misconstrued the establishment complacency at the last election. Of course, Labour has been monstered in the media throughout the campaign, and largely been judged by different standards than the Conservatives. Even the gold standard of scrutiny that Johnson dodged was just being interviewed by his former boss at the Spectator.Media plurality is an issue we need to address in this country: the alternative is living in a timeline where, because Corbyn has wonky glasses, in a couple of years you’ll be living in a tent city outside an Amazon warehouse trying to GoFund a tonsillectomy. The Tories calling Corbyn a communist and a threat to national security after handing nuclear power plants to the Chinese is a bit like getting a bollocking off Charles Manson for putting down slug pellets. Perhaps in a few years our troops will reflect on what a harmless enemy Corbyn actually was, as they stare up at an AI minotaur, pinning them to the floor with a stainless steel hoof and holding their extracted vascular system aloft like a Ford Focus wiring-loom.You won’t be surprised to learn that I won’t be voting Tory on Thursday, for much the same reasons that I won’t be spending the day kicking children and pensioners into traffic. It’s depressing to think how many polling stations are in schools, and how many people will vote Conservative after walking past a motivational rainbow. As we saw in Stanley Johnson’s Pinocchio gaffe, there is a problem with our elites programming their traumatised children with the idea that they are born to rule. It becomes almost impossible, as a class, to hide your contempt. It’s difficult to keep lying convincingly about things you’ve convinced yourself your audience are too stupid to notice. This current iteration of Conservatism, a kind of mutant nationalism that insists all our infrastructure has to be owned by other countries, has nowhere to go but into an asset-stripped, deregulated wasteland. I don’t know how anyone votes for that, or what happens after they do. British people don’t get on well enough to form militia.I don’t want to end on a note of pessimism. Instead, I’d like to share with you my two favourite quotes. The first, is a really famous one. Kurt Vonnegut asked his adult son what he thought the meaning of life was, and his son replied: “We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.” The second is what David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, said about the ending of the final episode:“Well, what Tony should have been thinking, I guess, and what we all should be thinking – although we can’t live that way – is that life is really short.

The train heads east to Newport and then north to Abergavenny. Before reaching Holyhead on Anglesey (Ynys Môn), it twice crosses into England and back into Wales, travelling through Herefordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire. The journey – about 225 miles as the crow flies – takes four hours and 53 minutes, if running on time. On Friday it was already behind schedule by the time it reached Newport.“Welcome to transport in Wales,” said Price, whose single ticket cost £88. “I’ve tried to scour the railway maps of Europe, I can’t think of any other country where you have to go into another country next door to travel from the south to north. It’s a unique Welsh experience. It’s extremely frustrating and we want to do something about it.One of the most eye-catching policies in the Plaid manifesto is a £20bn green jobs revolution. As part of that, Plaid wants to reopen a stretch from Carmarthen, in south-west Wales, to the coastal town of Aberystwyth, in mid-Wales, that has been closed since 1965. Plaid envisages a second phase in which missing links between mid and north Wales would be filled in.Price argued that a trans-Wales route would make communities such as Aberystwyth and Bangor, both thriving university towns, much more connected with the south and Cardiff. “A key problem in west Wales is the loss of young people from these communities. Investing in transport infrastructure such as the railways sends a message that you can stay here and still be connected to the world. You don’t need to be in central London, or central Cardiff for that matter, to have a successful business career.”Price pointed out that there was no strong rail link between communities where the Welsh language is strong, in the north-west and south-west. “Those communities share a lot in common,” he said. “We have to make those connections to create a sense of a united country.”A report commissioned by the Welsh government said reopening the Carmarthen to Aberystwyth line was feasible and would cost £775m.Plaid’s manifesto spells out other rail plans, including creating a cross-rail for the valleys in south Wales and electrifying all major lines by 2030. Price said a silver lining for the rail industry in Wales was that decades of under-investment meant it was pretty much a blank slate.“You’re starting from scratch in many ways, so instead of being behind the curve we could be at the leading edge, not playing catch-up but leap-frogging, thinking what the world is going to be like in 2050. There’s an opportunity for us to be a test-bed for technology such as hydrogen trains – an infrastructure laboratory for the 21st century.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a1af9ef743944b123f7c7317ebe8ce6733a0758/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ff551990989f7b83705a70d3f9a5247","title":"tory vote share at peak week to go before election","story":"Johnson’s polling mirrors that of May’s in 2017. No wonder the Conservative message is to warn against complacencyInterestingly, it is during this peak Tory period that YouGov carried out the fieldwork (20 to 26 November) for the most high-profile poll of the campaign – the MRP survey that models a result from every constituency – which forecast a Tory majority of 68, with Labour losing a string of seats in leave areas.No wonder then that the Conservative message from that point has been to warn against complacency – “things are MUCH tighter than they seem” Dominic Cummings wrote – with memories of Labour’s late recovery in 2017 lingering in the minds of party insiders.Their fears appear to have been partially justified as the last two weeks has seen Labour gradually squeeze the Liberal Democrat vote, a process that began after Jo Swinson’s appearance on Question Time on 22 November – where the hostility from the studio audience was unexpectedly pronounced – and continued as Boris Johnson’s poll lead lengthened the following week.It is a noticeable shift, but in another sense it changes nothing: wind back to the start of the election campaign, in late October, and the Conservative poll lead was … you can probably guess: 10 points. So, on the face of it, two squeezes in, and nothing much has changed.The effect on the Commons arithmetic could leave the Conservatives with a majority of 28 on the Electoral Calculus Model. Compare that with the start of the campaign, when the same forecaster was predicting a Tory majority of 76.Can Labour go further? The obvious place to start is with the Lib Dems. But it will be challenging for Labour to erode Lib Dem support by the 3 to 4 points it needs to even have a chance of depriving Johnson of an overall majority, not least because the Lib Dems’ clear anti-Brexit position appears to have boosted their core vote.Labour really needs to seize votes and seats from the Conservatives, although the momentum is, if anything, the other way. In Scotland, where the party had feared a wipeout, a YouGov poll this week has the Tories losing just five of its 13 seats. Even in London, where Labour is improving, the party could still gain Kensington and Battersea from Labour, because the remain vote is split with the Lib Dems.All of which sets up a nervy final stretch for Johnson. The Tories have a little more that they need to do which is why, exhibiting uncharacteristic discipline, the party leader keeps trying to hammer home the “Get Brexit Done” message, while avoiding his most obvious point of danger: an interview with Andrew Neil.Remember that under Theresa May, the Conservatives came so close in 2017. The party was nine seats from an overall majority and Labour only 2.35 points behind. At the moment Labour is 10 points down and the Tory poll share shows no signs of slipping. To stop Johnson walking into Downing Street, something needs to shift soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aabeac73bd9b99ffc2cad9b09fb5fd1e64854258/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7fcf73717b3ac0e72444100924214b","title":"bath clermont auvergne european champions cup match report rugby","story":"Nothing less than victory was going to save Bath in Europe this season and the guillotine has in effect now fallen. Three straight defeats in Pool 3 before a trip to the Massif Central is not the stuff of Champions Cup dreams and their great Heineken Cup days of yore are an increasingly distant memory.Clermont only rarely had to shift much beyond third gear to claim a comfortable bonus-point win, sealed with three final-quarter tries, two of them from their debutant winger Samuel Ezeala, who also set one up for his more experienced flanker Alexandre Lapandry. Aside from a nice first-half try from Rhys Priestland Bath were left with precious little to show for their efforts on another grim evening for their long-suffering supporters.This was the 100th game Bath have played in Europe but it is starting to feel like another lifetime since they won the big prize in 1998. Just about the only consolation for the Rec faithful was the return of the former Bath favourite Nick Abendanon, who was making his 50th tournament appearance, but otherwise this was a second forgettable Friday night in succession under the Somerset lights. “History would suggest it’s a foregone conclusion for us now,” acknowledged their “frustrated” director of rugby, Stuart Hooper.The heavy surface again did not help, Bath having previously got bogged down against Saracens here last week. Until they develop some backline fluency it is going to be a long season, with their Premiership campaign also producing little joy, even if the powerful Clermont pack were always going to be hard to subdue.By far Bath’s best moments came before half-time, not least Priestland’s 13th-minute score. With the whole of Clermont expecting the outside-half to attempt a drop-goal the Welsh fly-half instead scooted left and, with the French defence flat-footed, cut through to score the game’s first points.His angled conversion was also spot on and visibly boosted home confidence, with Jonathan Joseph putting Jamie Roberts through another gap which, on another day, might have yielded a try, too. With some of the floodlights temporarily failing as well, it was looking an increasingly gloomy night for the visitors.Clermont, though, are the kind of team who can flick the switch at any moment. With the stadium lights also fully restored, their captain, Morgan Parra, went on a curving run behind a couple of teammates and gave his centre George Moala enough space to crash over. Parra converted to level the scores but a penalty in front of the posts six minutes before the interval should have given Bath a useful half-time lead. Instead, rather oddly, they chose to gamble on a kick to the corner, only for Clermont to defend the resultant maul with some ease.Having lost by one and six points respectively in their two previous pool games, the margins in Europe are too fine to mess about, particularly on gluepots like this. If, like Exeter, the driven lineout is a consistent weapon, it is a risk worth taking. Bath, unfortunately, are not yet the sum of their expensive parts, particularly with several forwards out injured.They also failed to benefit from the influential Parra failing to return for the second half. His replacement Greig Laidlaw coolly landed a couple of characteristically neat penalties to trump one from Priestland but, although a third attempt out of the mire from almost 50 metres unsurprisingly fell short, it did not ultimately matter. Ezeala’s nicely angled line earned him a deserved 66th-minute try before the promising 19-year-old, who was born in Barcelona, supplied the supporting Lapandry with a deft try-scoring pass two minutes later and then grabbed a second for himself. Joseph’s late try was little consolation.There will be more of the same – and possibly worse – awaiting Bath in France next weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c781ad75e849d5036ad74cea2f0594ddd3aa47d3/40_122_3415_2049/master/3415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95e7cf68c45e0527d3734f5c6dd61a95","title":"jordan spieth get away usa presidents cup royal melbourne","story":"Jordan Spieth’s position at 44th in the world is not alarming when placed in the context of others. Jason Day is 31st on the same list, Sergio García has slipped to 35th and Bubba Watson is 41st. Nonetheless the scale of Spieth’s arrival into professional golf – whereby he won two majors in 2015 and added another two years later – means his subsequent tribulations are worthy of attention. The last of Spieth’s 11th main tour wins was the Open Championship of 2017.“I’ll probably be better than I ever was because of it and have better perspective as well,” Spieth says of his recent struggles.This next week will sting for Spieth, just as it will serve as an indicator of how far his star has fallen. He did not secure automatic qualification for the USA’s Presidents Cup team and was not a back-up pick either, meaning this weekend’s Hero World Challenge will conclude his 2019 while friends and colleagues fly to Melbourne.“It will be tough for me at home,” he says. “I’ll try and just get away while the tournament’s going on because you never want to miss those events when you’ve been a part of them for a number of years.“When it’s being played without being there? That will be where I’ll probably say: ‘I took it for granted.’ I’ll certainly work my butt off not to miss one of these again. I always liked the lead-in and the playing practice rounds together, preparing to be a team representing your country. Yeah, it’s tough.”Spieth’s diligence has never been in question. He has admirable perspective on life but when asked how his toils have impacted upon him, technicality is the theme. “I’m hitting shots and I’m like: ‘Something feels off and I can’t quite figure it out,’” the 26-year-old adds. “That’s been the toughest part for me because I know when I’m in control, I will put myself in position. I have the confidence mentally when I’m in control of the mechanical side of things to win out here and to contend week in and week out.”Spieth is a rarity in an inidual sporting environment as many others are willing him to bounce back. The Texan is such a decent, respectful and grounded inidual that he did not offend anyone when the going was good. Throughout 2019, when top-10 finishes were a rarity and frustration frequently apparent, Spieth was as candid as he was courteous. This week in the Bahamas, he has been able to play with an element of freedom.“It’s a little easier when you’re not having to play a full schedule where every day you wake up and you’re like: ‘I know that I’m not there but I’ve got to go do it anyway,’” Spieth says. “That gets tough sometimes. So it’s nice to have the off-season and play a few events. The season ending in August this year is, I think, good timing for me.”Spieth wants the new year to deliver the narrative with which he was once so accustomed.Hero MotorCorp paid for Ewan Murray’s flights and accommodation in the Bahamas"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9281d78b0795385aa965ce1bc0ddd3717a33157c/0_84_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e078ab9945e6c4e990b002744c244c7","title":"moeen ali england south africa","story":"• All-rounder met Joe Root and England management this week• Moeen set to play in Pakistan Super League next yearMoeen Ali is expected to continue his break from Test cricket despite talks with Joe Root and the England management this week.Ed Smith, the national selector, will name England’s squad for the series in South Africa on Saturday, with Jonny Bairstow, Jimmy Anderson and Mark Wood tipped to return after missing out on the 1-0 series defeat in New Zealand.But Moeen is not expected to be among the touring party. The 32-year-old agreed a spell out of Test consideration at the end of the season after being dropped one match into the Ashes and then omitted from the list of Test central contracts.The latter decision by England has had a knock-on effect, with Moeen’s value as an established international cricketer on the global T20 circuit now greater than the overseas tour and match fees earned by a non-contracted player.On Friday he was signed on a £150,000 deal to play for Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League, the side being run by the former England team director, Andy Flower, and England’s head analyst, Nathan Leamon.The PSL runs from 20 February to 22 March, the back end of which coincides with England’s two-Test tour to Sri Lanka. Root and the selectors will likely touch base with Moeen again before that squad is picked, given the off-spinning all-rounder was central to the 3-0 series win there last year with 18 wickets.Moeen’s absence means Matt Parkinson is expected to continue as one of two spinners in the England Test squad who depart for South Africa on 13 December, although his Lancashire teammate, Saqib Mahmood, may be the seamer to make way for the returning Anderson and Wood.The pair, on the comeback trail from calf and side injuries respectively, are in South Africa as part of a fast-bowling camp, which has been forced to move from Potchefstroom to Cape Town owing to bad weather.Bairstow is also on the trip reconditioning his batting against the red ball.

We didn’t need to engage with third parties we thought we could do it ourselves.”In the two and a half years since Darbon’s arrival, the resurrection of the modern Saints has been quite something. Out of stale, stodgy mediocrity has sprung a team whose glass is now determinedly half full, even with many of the same players involved. The club’s balance sheet is also far healthier, as is the prevailing mood around Franklin’s Gardens. Saturday’s visitors, Leinster, will find it a stark contrast to their past two European visits, which resulted in 37‑10 and 40‑7 away wins respectively.These are still early days, of course, but how has this transformation occurred? If you passed the understated Darbon in the street in his dark jeans and jumper, you might not necessarily notice the alchemist quietly reinventing the east Midlands pecking order. In a former life, though, he was responsible for trying to flog more whisky to China and was operations manager for London’s Olympic Park in 2012 along the way he also spent time in New York promoting Tough Mudder endurance events. Selling a better brand of rugby to the converted must have felt like a comparative doddle.His first act, following the exit of the long-serving Jim Mallinder in December 2017, was to sift through the 60 CVs that arrived within 24 hours of the vacancy arising. One, from a well-known former international coach, pinged into his in-box within 19 minutes but Darbon was not seeking a shotgun marriage. “When we started the search we were very clear about the criteria. Above everything else we wanted someone who had won something in the recent past. There are a lot of coaches out there that have never won anything.”Also on the wish list were other specific qualities: experienced, good with young players, the ability to refresh a fading squad and an advocate of attractive rugby. The job description could virtually have been written for Chris Boyd, the board’s eventual choice. The New Zealander had coached his country’s under-20 side, presided over a champion Hurricanes team who scored tries for fun, and is no speak-your-weight coaching robot. “Chris was there on Skype in his hoodie and flip-flops, which he wears most of the time,” Darbon recalls. “But when you speak to him you realise he’s got a real clarity of thought: he’s very structured and measured but he generally delivers it in quite a relaxed style.”Boyd is also smart enough to know the first rule of enlightened head coaching: find yourself a super-talented assistant. When he asked various people to nominate the best young English attack coach the same name kept cropping up: Sam Vesty.The former Leicester and Bath back was coaching at Worcester but jumped at the chance to join the Boyd revolution. The pair swiftly decided it was a no-brainer to back the youthful talent of Rory Hutchinson, George Furbank, Tom Collins, Fraser Dingwall and James Grayson outside the electric Cobus Reinach. The rest is free-running, fast-paced history.It sounds so obvious in hindsight: Saints, despite their 2014 Premiership title during the Mallinder era, almost always respond positively to having a New Zealander – Wayne Smith, Wayne Shelford – in the vanguard.Boyd, like Darbon, is no fan of blinkered orthodoxy and tells a revealing story about his first meeting with the Wales fly-half Dan Biggar, signed by the previous regime and now trying to impress a coach more accustomed to having Beauden Barrett as his playmaker. “I’d never met him before and he’d never met me. He’s probably a little bit more conservative than I’ve traditionally been used to as a playmaker but we mutually agreed that if we were open-minded and got it right we’d have a good time together. If we didn’t it would not be so good for either of us.”Their unlikely relationship has blossomed to the point where Biggar rates the 61-year-old Boyd even more highly than his erstwhile Wales coach Warren Gatland. “For me Chris is by far the best coach I have ever been involved with. He’s brought a real positivity and calls a spade a spade … there are no grey areas for him. I think if you asked any of the boys here they’d have very little bad to say about Chris. I feel I get better every day in this environment.”The next big question, even so, is whether the reborn, attack-minded Saints can unpick a tight, defensively-strong European unit such as Leinster? While Boyd is wryly amusing about the Irish provinces’ ability to rest key men – “I don’t understand how the Pro14 works particularly, but what I do know is the very best players don’t play very much” – his priority is to ensure Northampton do not revert to conservative old ways which he feels hold many English clubs back.Interestingly, he argues the continuing threat of relegation from the Premiership is among the biggest factors. “Relegation is a great driver of theatre in a lot of English sport. In football whole towns celebrate the fact they don’t get relegated. I don’t know if they’ll take relegation away or not but I’d bet my house that, if they did, the average score would go up by 10-15 points straight away.” Would that be an automatic improvement? “It has to be. In the next three-to-four years I guarantee it’ll become more like American football. All that stuff, like throwing in a rag to protest, will come in because we’re in the entertainment world now. TV rules, don’t they?”Under Boyd, though, Saints will not get too far ahead of themselves. “We are a nearly club because in 20 years we’ve won one Heineken Cup and one Premiership. I was pleased with the way we played last week but we’re not going to get that much time and space against Leinster. There are sides – and Leinster do it extremely well – who will kill you if you get too loose. The question is whether we can get enough scraps and turn them into gold. If we don’t it’ll be a long day at the office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5ed9ce8a99e2017c551a40a79faa17e7678fb1/0_50_3442_2066/master/3442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=203551ea8eb5752fb1940d0752ee7edc","title":"amazon new york city offices lease","story":"The company had cancelled plans for a headquarters in Queens 10 months ago, after backlash from residents and politiciansNew York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is “waiting on the haters to apologize” after Amazon announced it would open corporate offices in New York City after all, nearly a year after the internet giant abruptly reversed a decision to build a second headquarters there.Amazon said on Friday it will open offices in New York City’s Hudson Yards neighborhood in 2021 to house its consumer and advertising teams, marking its most substantial expansion in the city since the reversal.The move comes 10 months after the company cancelled plans for a headquarters in Queens after extensive backlash from residents and politicians, including Ocasio-Cortez. They had objected to the nearly $3bn in financial incentives the city and state had offered Amazon for the construction of the headquarters. Numerous cities had vied to host the new Amazon headquarters, hoping that elaborate incentive packages would attract the giant. When the company ultimately chose to split the HQ2 between Washington DC and New York City, it garnered criticism from those who said it continues a negative trend of pulling top talent and technology to the coasts. Critics in New York also worried the headquarters, planned to be built in a working class area of Queens, would raise rents in the area and push locals into homelessness. Ocasio-Cortez and other critics noted on Friday that this time around, Amazon is moving into Manhattan without any extravagant tax incentives.“Won’t you look at that: Amazon is coming to NYC anyway - *without* requiring the public to finance shady deals, helipad handouts for Jeff Bezos, \u0026amp corporate giveaways”, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Friday in response to Amazon’s move. “Maybe the Trump admin should focus more on cutting public assistance to billionaires instead of poor families.”Amazon’s expansion in New York City comes as part of its plans to “continue to hire and grow organically” across its 18 tech hubs, a spokeswoman told the  by email.

He did not address Unsworth, whose team had told the court earlier on Friday the Tesla CEO should pay at least $190m in damages for his tweets about the er.“My faith in humanity is restored,” Musk told reporters in the hallways of the courtroom.“I came here for a verdict and unfortunately it was not what I expected but I respect the jury’s decision,” Unsworth said after emerging from the courtroom about an hour after the verdict was read.“The challenge that was thrown down by Elon Musk was that if you don’t sue it’s true,” said his lead attorney, L Lin Wood. “We sued because it’s false.”Mark Stephens, Unsworth’s solicitor in the UK, said: “It is a pity that a bullying billionaire has been able to cast such a long shadow, and I just hope that nobody else has to go … toe to toe with Mr Musk.”The case pitted a 64-year-old financial adviser earning a salary of about £25,000 ($33,000) against one of the richest and most famous men in the world. The dispute stemmed from the Tesla and SpaceX chief’s ancillary involvement in the Tham Luang cave rescue in June and July 2018, which saw 12 young football players and their coach successfully extracted from a flooded cave system by a team of British cave ers.On 13 July 2018, after the successful completion of the rescue, Unsworth said in an interview with CNN that the rescue pod Musk had delivered to the cave site was a “PR stunt”, adding that he should “stick his submarine where it hurts”. A video clip of the interview went viral, drawing the ire of Musk.Musk eventually deleted the tweets and apologized to Unsworth. He apologized again from the witness stand and contended, “I did not accuse Mr Unsworth of being a pedophile.”While much of the evidence presented to the jury over three days of testimony involved the details of the cave rescue and the aftermath of Musk’s tweets, the jury was tasked with determining whether a reasonable person would understand the tweets to mean that Musk was calling Unsworth a pedophile.Musk’s attorneys argued that the tweet was not a statement of fact, but an insult, which is considered protected speech. They also attempted to show that Unsworth’s reputation had not been seriously damaged because his efforts in the rescue operation were rewarded with an MBE, a medal from the Thai king, and other honors.“It doesn’t matter that it’s not the most common insult,” Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, said during closing arguments. “You’re free to speak certain things in this country.”Spiro further argued that Musk’s statement should never have been considered unlawful behavior. “Federal courts are not meant for people who insult each other,” he said.Unsworth testified that “being branded a pedophile” had made him feel “humiliated, ashamed, dirty”. “I was effectively given a life sentence without parole,” he said. “It hurts to talk about it.”His attorneys introduced evidence of the broad dissemination of Musk’s tweets, which were reported in 490 English-language articles on 361 websites in 33 countries.They also introduced evidence of Musk’s behavior after the 15 July tweets, including his hiring of a private investigator to seek proof of Unsworth’s “nefarious behaviour”. The investigator was actually a conman, but Musk relied on his false information when he called Unsworth a “child rapist” in an email to a BuzzFeed News reporter in August 2018.“Elon Musk is a liar,” said Wood, Unsworth’s attorney, in his closing argument. Musk, who attended court Friday for the first time since his testimony, raised an eyebrow at the remark.Wood pointed to inconsistencies in Musk’s testimony, tweets, and communication with a reporter. He compared the impact of the “pedo guy” tweet on Unsworth’s life to a “nuclear bomb”, with invisible but lasting affects.In explaining his suggestion of a $190m in damages, Wood said of the billionaire: “What he needs is a hard slap on the wrist.”The jury ended up deliberating for less than an hour. The foreman, Joshua Jones, said the panel decided that Unsworth’s lawyers spent too much time trying to appeal to their emotions and not concentrating on the evidence.“The failure probably happened because they didn’t focus on the tweets,” Jones said after the verdict was announced. “I think they tried to get our emotions involved in it. In a court of law you have to prove your case, which they did not prove.”The Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85dcc2fd4fafedf0402154f99dd07a81a357c5b7/0_218_4635_2782/master/4635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83099cf5228f4b475b3add70f6219b16","title":"evo morales heads to cuba amid talk of an eventual comeback","story":"Bolivia’s toppled president flies out of Mexico for what his former health minister says is a medical appointmentBolivia’s recently toppled president, Evo Morales, has left Mexico for Cuba as part of what some observers suspect is the first step in a bid to stage a dramatic political comeback.On Friday night, less than a month after being forced into exile in Mexico, Morales flew out of the country on a plane bound for Havana.Mexico’s foreign relations ministry confirmed that Morales had left for Cuba on Friday, on what it called a temporary visit.The Mexican newspaper El Universal said official sources had confirmed Morales’ departure for the communist-run Caribbean island.Last month a commentator from the same newspaper, Salvador García Soto, had predicted Bolivia’s first indigenous president would relocate to another Latin American country “where he would be able to organise his resistance plan and strategy to attempt to return to Bolivia to recover power in the near future”.Morales touched down in Mexico on 12 November after Mexico’s leftist leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, sent an airforce plane to rescue him from the South American country he had governed since 2006.Morales fled Bolivia after being forced to resign on 10 November in what political foes celebrated as a popular uprising against an increasingly authoritarian leader but which Morales’ supporters branded a right-wing coup d’état.“It is a racist coup,” Sacha Llorenti, Morales’ former ambassador to the United Nations, said in a recent interview.López Obrador’s administration had welcomed Morales to Mexico and offered him political asylum. However, García Soto, the Mexican commentator, argued that a lengthy stay in Mexico would have damaged already fragile US-Mexico ties.Donald Trump’s White House would not have appreciated seeing Mexico’s government “support, and much less finance, a campaign by the deposed president to retake power in Bolivia”, he argued. “That is why Evo’s presence cannot last too long ... because the more time that passes the more likely it is to become a source of tension between Mexico and the US.”On Friday, Spain’s El País reported that Morales was also unlikely to spend much time in Cuba and instead planned to relocate to Argentina once that country’s new leftist leader, Alberto Fernández, took office next week.The Mexican newspaper Reforma said Morales had travelled to Cuba with his former vice president, Álvaro García Linera, and his former health minister, Gabriela Montaño. “President Evo Morales is in Cuba for a medical appointment with the Cuban medical team that treated him in Bolivia,” Montano told Reuters.In a recent interview with the  in Mexico City, Morales hinted that his political aspirations had not ended with exile.“Struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle, that is where I come from,” he said.For now, a return to Bolivia looks highly unlikely. Morales has ruled out taking part in a fresh round of presidential elections, called as a result of suspicions of vote rigging in his favour.Last month the interior minister of Bolivia’s rightwing interim government vowed to jail Morales for the rest of his life for allegedly inciting anti-government protests that he claimed amounted to terrorism.“Any terrorist should spend the rest of their life in prison – any terrorist – Evo Morales or whoever. It’s not about whether you’re an ex-president or white or black or a campesino … In fact, it’s even worse when it’s an ex-president,” Arturo Murillo said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4107458.1575675667!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"broadband plan first 35 areas to get high speed service are revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe first four areas to be serviced  will be the areas around the cities of Limerick, Kilkenny and Galway, and around Carrigaline, south of Cork city.The first 35 areas to be served with high-speed broadband under the National Broadband Plan have been revealed at a private industry meeting.The locations for the network points, which will be built between now and the end of 2021, are spread across the country, but more are located in the east and the midlands.

From early on, the numbers pointed towards a victory of two or three, depending on whether Independent TD Denis Naughten abstained or supported the Government of which he was a member until he resigned from Cabinet last year.Every Government TD and all Ministers were ordered to be present in the Dáil for Tuesday’s vote. Some came home early from foreign trips. Others arrived just in time from European Union business in Brussels.“The worry wasn’t the Independents,” said one Government figure. “It was fog at Dublin Airport.”Around the time Charlie Flanagan and others were touching down and heading straight for the Dáil, Kyne brought Peter Fitzpatrick, the Louth TD who resigned the Fine Gael whip last year, to his office in a last-minute bid to get him to support the Government. Fitzpatrick did not budge.Other opposition Independent TDs who were thinking of abstaining, such as Dublin Central’s Maureen O’Sullivan and Tipperary’s Mattie McGrath, moved definitively against the Government.More Independent deputies had been approached, too, and asked to either abstain, vote with the Government or provide a pair – an arrangement where an Opposition TD absents themselves or abstains to compensate for a Minister who is away on State business.The 32nd Dáil, which has so often dulled the political senses during its life, crackled on the night that could yet be remembered as heralding the beginning of its end.Christmas electionTaoiseach Leo Varadkar had told his Fine Gael Ministers at their weekly pre-Cabinet gathering earlier on Tuesday that an election would follow if the motion was lost. Polling day would be Saturday, December 28th – a novel way to enliven the lazy days between Christmas and New Year’s.“He said we can’t have it on December 24th – ha, ha, ha – but it would have been December 28th,” said one Minister. As well as discussing the confidence vote, Ministers also rallied each other after Fine Gael’s failure to win any of the four byelections held in Wexford, Cork North Central, Dublin Fingal and Dublin Mid West the previous weekend.The Government’s survival was never truly in doubt on Tuesday night, but the motion of no confidence was a clarifying, if not a decisive, moment for Varadkar’s minority Fine Gael-Independent administration.The tightness of the 56-53 result and the calcifying of Dáil opinion against the Government, which had to rely on three Opposition Independent TDs – Noel Grealish, Denis Naughten and Michael Lowry – to win, provided the drama.“You don’t assume they are rock solid at any stage, especially on confidence motions because they are very stark,” said one source when speaking about the three Independents who came to the Government’s aid. “Denis is an old hand at this and didn’t show his hand until the very end. We were confident of 55-53, 56-53 was a bonus.”To add further spice to evening for Fine Gael TDs, Tom Curran, the party’s general secretary - whose presence always sparks palace intrigue about election tickets -\u0026nbsp was spotted in Leinster House.Hours after the vote, Fine Gael was down one more TD.Dara Murphy resigned his Cork North Central seat to take up a new role with the European Commission, unhelpfully leaving his colleagues to deal with public anger over his non-attendance in Leinster House while claiming a TD’s salary and expenses.The Government’s Dáil strength now stands at 53, out of a total of 158 TDs. The confidence and supply deal sees Fianna Fáil’s 45 TDs abstain on budget and confidence votes and the Ceann Comhairle only uses his casting vote in the event of a tie.Fianna Fáil’s John McGuinness says he will no longer abstain on confidence motions, meaning the Government is facing a 56-56 tie if another motion is put down against Minister for Health Simon Harris or the Government itself in the New Year.And that’s if it holds on to Naughten, Grealish and Lowry. Naughten confirmed this week that he will take any future votes on a “case-by-case basis” and Fine Gaelers picked up signals that the same Independent support is unlikely to be forthcoming again.“They are basically saying: ‘That was it, lads’,” said one senior party figure, who understood how helping a government at the end of its term would be politically difficult. “Why would they? They may as well join Fine Gael.”Lowry and Grealish were seen by Ministers as always likely to support the Government but Naughten was the last to commit, after he said he secured amendments to the Fair Deal nursing home legislation. Grealish told friends that he had not asked for anything for his support.Naughten had been contacted by Kyne on the Thursday before the vote, and the Chief Whip inquired if he, at the very least, would abstain. Naughten could give no such commitment.Independent Roscommon Galway TD Michael Fitzmaurice was called by Tánaiste Simon Coveney last Saturday afternoon. Coveney asked if Fitzmaurice could provide him with a pair, since he would be in Israel and Palestine for the vote. Fitzmaurice agreed, but says he will not do so again. “If there is a motion against Simon Harris, I’d be voting for it. I’d vote for the Government to be taken down.”UnsustainableAll sides in the Dáil believe the numbers are unsustainable and that if Boris Johnson wins a majority in the British general election on Thursday and passes the Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons to allow Brexit actually happen at the end of January, an Irish election will follow early in 2020.The tabling of another confidence motion by some element of the Opposition is a real possibility, probability, or guaranteed, depending on one’s view, although none can be put down in Eoghan Murphy for another six months,“It doesn’t matter what the motion is on,” said one Minister. “If there is a motion of no confidence on bingo, we wouldn’t have the numbers.“People are openly saying: ‘Should we come back after Christmas at all’?” the Minister added, suggesting Varadkar could simply call an election before the Christmas Dáil recess ends.“He said it is important for trust,” one party frontbencher said.Varadkar’s preferred election date is next May and he told the Fine Gael parliamentary party his position is still that the country should still go to the polls in six months.Yet events are slipping beyond his control, and Fine Gael fought on numerous fronts this week.Dara MurphyThe controversy surrounding Dara Murphy caused the party serious damage, according to TDs. Murphy is disliked by many TDs who formed the vanguard of Varadkar’s campaign for the Fine Gael leadership campaign 2½ years ago. The former Minister for European Affairs was a close ally of Enda Kenny and took Coveney’s side against Varadkar in the leadership contest.The TDs retold yarns to each other this week as if to remind themselves of what it was that irked them about Murphy – how he was high-handed with backbenchers at times how he was often one of the first on his feet to defend Kenny at moments of trouble and what one Minister close to Varadkar viciously described as his “absolute craven lick-arseing of Kenny”.Sympathy was in short supply when he scuttled into the chamber on Tuesday evening to vote on the motion on his namesake, Eoghan Murphy, just before handing in his letter of resignation as a TD to Leas Ceann Comhairle Pat “The Cope” Gallagher.“He was awkwardly smiling as if he was being ribbed,” said one Minister who watched on as Murphy took part in the walk-through vote on the motion of no confidence.Some in Fine Gael felt Varadkar should have been tougher in public when he spoke about Murphy. However, many felt that both the weekly parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday and Tuesday’s pre-Cabinet meeting of party Ministers had galvanising effects after a trying few weeks.At the pre-Cabinet meeting, Michael Ring, the Minister for Rural Affairs, said some of his colleagues believed their loyalty was to the media rather than the party. His view is shared by other party veterans, surprised at the public back-biting going on, if anonymously, within Fine Gael. Picking up on this, Varadkar told TDs to stop briefing journalists on an off the record basis.Concern that discipline seems to be breaking down is evident among the longest-serving.“There is no loyalty,” said one source. “They are going out to the media all the time, but they’ll get a kick in the hole.“A lot of them came in too soft. They got their Dáil seats too soft. They are too ambitious. They think they should be ministers on the first day. Like Dara Murphy – he has done us more damage than anyone. He is a b*****ks.”Another old party hand said: “There are very few natural leaders in Fine Gael. That’s coming through.”But Fine Gaelers still believe they can beat Fianna Fáil at the next election, and claim that Martin’s party, after winning two seats in the byelections, is not as strong as may seem at first glance.“If they were serious, they’d have been over the quota in two constituencies,” said one member of the Cabinet of the byelections, who also said Fianna Fáil’s performances in Dublin Mid West and Dublin Fingal showed it had yet to fully recover in the capital. Varadkar also this week repeated his view to TDs that he will not underpin a Fianna Fáil-led minority government from Opposition if he wins more Dáil seats than Martin.“There are people writing articles now that are like ‘Dewey Beats Truman’,” said another Minister of some predictions that Fine Gael will not be in power after the election, referencing the Chicago Tribune newspaper which famously miscalled the outcome of the 1948 US presidential election.With the UK election next week, as well as a meeting of the European Council, Fine Gael hopes attention will switch back to Brexit, one of its strongest calling cards.As the precarious edifice of the 32nd Dáil crumbles, some Ministers swear they will not enter into a confidence and supply agreement again – the next government, they say, must command a Dáil majority.“The Dáil is over now,” one said. “The only thing that could stop it is Brexit, if it is not sorted. The game is so tight, and after that the real problems start. It has to be a majority.”This means “every option has to be looked at” – the Greens, Labour, and whether, even, “we go to Sinn Féin”.“It’ll take months – don’t rule out a second election. You’re not going to believe me, but it was the best week Fine Gael had in a long while. We know we have to fight now. We got the kick in the balls we needed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4107479.1575713861!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"elon musk cleared of defamation over pedo guy tweet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTesla chief executive Elon Musk (centre) arriving at Friday’s hearing. Photograph: Mark J TerrillAPTesla Inc boss Elon Musk emerged victorious on Friday from a closely watched defamation trial as a federal court jury swiftly rejected the $190 million claim brought against him by a British cave explorer who Musk had branded a “pedo guy” on Twitter.The unanimous verdict by a panel of five women and three men was returned after roughly 45 minutes of deliberation on the fourth day of Mr Musk’s trial. Legal experts believe it was the first major defamation lawsuit brought by a private inidual over remarks on Twitter to be decided by a jury.The outcome was a triumph for Mr Musk, whose mercurial behaviour in a number of instances last year came under close scrutiny from federal regulators and shareholders of Tesla, his Silicon Valley-based electric car manufacturer.The jury’s decision signals a higher legal threshold for challenging potentially libelous Twitter comments, said L. Lin Wood, the high-profile trial lawyer who led the legal team for the plaintiff, Vernon Unsworth.“This verdict puts everyone’s reputation at risk,” Mr Wood told reporters after the verdict was announced.Other lawyers specialising in defamation agreed the verdict reflects how the freewheeling nature of social media has altered understandings of what distinguishes libel punishable in court from casual rhetoric and hyperbole protected as free speech.Mr Musk (48), who had testified during the first two days of the trial in his own defence and returned to court on Friday to hear closing arguments, exited the courtroom after the verdict and said: “My faith in humanity is restored.”Outside the courthouse, Mr Unsworth (64) said he was resigned to his defeat. “I accept the jury’s verdict, take it on the chin and get on with my life.”Wood said his client went “toe to toe with a billionaire bully,” echoing a phrase from his summation earlier in court, and indicated to reporters that an appeal was doubtful.“It’s not the verdict we wanted. But it’s the end of the road and we now close this chapter,” Mr Wood said.He said he nevertheless saw the lawsuit as meaningful in helping erase the stain he said Mr Unsworth’s reputation suffered.ApologyDuring the course of the trial, Mr Musk testified under oath that his use of the term “pedo guy” - slang for paedophile - was never meant to be taken literally, and he apologized to Unsworth for the comment from the witness stand.The case stems from a public quarrel between Mr Musk and Mr Unsworth, a British er who lives part-time in Thailand and gained fame for his leading role in coordinating the successful rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in that country in July 2018.Unsworth had chided Mr Musk in a CNN interview for delivering a mini-submarine, which was never used, to the site of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system. Mr Unsworth called Mr Musk’s intervention a “P.R.” stunt and said the high-tech entrepreneur should “stick his submarine where it hurts.”Mr Musk responded two days later on Twitter with three posts that became the basis of the defamation case. The first questioned Unsworth’s role in the rescue, while the second said, “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.”The third tweet, in reply to a follower who asked Mr Musk about the second tweet, said, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.”Mr Wood said during his summation that Mr Musk’s tweets were akin to a “nuclear bomb” that would overshadow Unsworth’s relationships and job prospects for years to come and urged jurors to teach the Tesla chief executive and SpaceX founder a lesson by awarding Unsworth $190 million, including $150 million in punitive damages.Two days earlier, under questioning on the witness stand, Mr Musk had estimated his net worth at $20 billion.Defence caseBut the jury was apparently swayed by the arguments put forth by Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, who said the tweets in question amounted to an off-hand insult in the midst of an argument, which no one could be expected to take seriously.“In arguments you insult people,” he said. “No bomb went off.”The defence also said Unsworth failed to demonstrate any harm from the Twitter comments and even tried to profit from his role in the rescue, which won him plaudits from the Thai and British governments.US District Judge Stephen Wilson had said the case hinged on whether a reasonable person would take Mr Musk’s Twitter statements to mean he was actually calling Mr Unsworth a paedophile.To win, Mr Unsworth needed to show that Mr Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified the plaintiff and caused him harm. “Actual malice” on Mr Musk’s part, a high standard in defamation cases, did not need to be proven since the judge deemed Unsworth a private inidual, not a public figure.The trial revived discussion of Mr Musk’s erratic behaviour in 2018, when he used Twitter to float a leveraged buyout proposal for Tesla that was scuttled, ultimately paying $20 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint.For most of 2019, Mr Musk, who has nearly 30 million Twitter followers, has largely kept his public comments focused on Tesla’s new models and improved profitability and on the technical progress of his aerospace company, SpaceX. - Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.General election 2019: Nigel Dodds says tariff-free trade deal with EU would ‘go a long way’ towards securing DUP support - latest newsComment: The likes of China and Russia fight wars in the shadows.

Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry.

(JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel.

This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Only two acts have been announced for next year’s Glastonbury so far, with Paul McCartney confirming his appearance last month (18 November) and Diana Ross confirmed for the festival’s “legends” slot.Taylor Swift is currently tipped to be another of the festival’s headliners next year, with co-organiser Michael Eavis confirming that one of the two headliners left to be announced is a woman.“You would love her to bits – everybody does – but no names at the moment,” he told BBC Somerset.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises.

Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  In Islamic eschatology, Al-Masih ad-Dajjal is an evil figure comparable to the Antichrist – whose name translates to the false messiah, liar, the deceiver in Arabic.\u0026nbspTwitter user @frankoceanhafiz tweeted: Crying @ the fact that Muslims figured out the twist ending of the Netflix \u0027Messiah\u0027 show bc they LITERALLY NAMED THE CHARACTER DAJJAL.In response, one Twitter user wrote: Goes to show you that english speakers also dont look into the meaning or context of the concepts they use - that they borrow these concepts merely because theyre \u0027exotic\u0027 to other english speakers, meant to entertain an audience of english speakers and probs no one else (sic).Messiah\u0026nbsphas received a considerable amount of hype ahead of its release in 2020.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The protest, organised by the climate strike movement Fridays for Future, was also attended by many students, families and professionals.Just a few miles away, in the stuffy surroundings of Madrid’s largest conference centre, negotiators from across the world continued to try to hammer out the final details of the 2015 Paris Agreement.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Thunberg made a surprise appearance at the conference on Friday to meet other young activists before being whisked away by security. She had hitch-hiked her way across the world after the talks were moved from Chile due to civil unrest.Ms Thunberg later told reporters that the voices of climate strikers were being heard but not enough “concrete action” was taking place. Of course there is no victory, because the only thing we want to see is real action,” she said. “So we have achieved a lot, but if you look at it from a certain point of view we have achieved nothing.Created with Sketch.

Speaking at a panel run by the Association of Small Island States, Samoan student Brianna Fruean from 350 Samoa and the Pacific Climate Warriors, said it was critical to remember that some nations represented at the talks were fighting for sheer survival. “World leaders need to know that people like me are watching them.”The key sticking points of the talks, which began on Monday, are how to establish new international rules for carbon markets and how to help poorer countries pay for losses and damage caused by climate change.A decision on carbon market rules is proving tricky because of disagreements about what to do with the surplus credits from earlier emission trading schemes and how to avoid ‘double counting’ emission cuts that are traded overseas.Progress on loss and damage is also a long way off. Many vulnerable nations are pressing for a new financial mechanism to pay for major, one-off disasters such as hurricanes and typhoons, as well as longer term problems exacerbated by climate change.Hillary Clinton says male leaders are ‘scared’ of Greta ThunbergBut influential developed countries, particularly Australia, Japan and Switzerland (as well as the US, which is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement), do not want finance on the table at all because they think it will open the floodgates for future compensation claims.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Russia in particular is resistant to the discussion of human rights in any context.An underlying concern at the talks is the extent to which countries will be expected to be more ambitious when they revise their national carbon-cutting commitments next year.A recent report by UN Environment Programme warned that there was a huge gap between what countries had committed to so far and the goal of keeping global warming to a reasonably safe level. It found global fossil fuel production needs to be more than halved by 2030 to stay within a 1.5c temperature rise, with coal the biggest offender.Pressure to come to an agreement on these issues will rise next week as high-ranking national ministers arrive in Madrid. Whatever they decide will determine the path ahead to the next talks, which will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow next November.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clearly it takes courage to stand before an audience charged with being funny enough to quieten the clink of cutlery.But let’s be frank. He is simply another BBC comedian with acceptable views.BBC-approved comedians dominate the maintained sector of British comedy.Auntie is the superpower of sponsored satire, scattering municence in the direction of any up-and-coming talent with a neat line in attacking approved targets: The patriarchy, Brexit, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Tories, country-sports enthusiasts, royalists and Priti Patel. You get the picture.Of course, not all comedians rely on such sketches. But those that don’t often pay the price.Take talented young comedian Alistair Williams, who shot to prominence off the back of a sketch in which he likened Brexit to being stuck in a Burger King you have voted to leave. His video soon went viral.But as he noted on Twitter the next day: “Because I am a comedian that supports Brexit, you can no longer find me on the comedy club circuit.”There are exceptions. Pro-Brexit comedian Geoff Norcott is gradually finding his way on to a few BBC shows.Simon Evans is a successful comic who parodies his own upper-middle class, right-of-centre viewpoint, while occasionally getting in an anti-leftist dig along the way.But compare that to the roll call of liberal-left comics who pop up on the BBC: Ed Byrne, Dara O Briain, Marcus Brigstocke, Jolyon Rubinstein, Sandi Toksvig, Mitchell and Webb, Mark Steel, Mark Thomas, Jo Brand, Andy Parsons, Russell Howard and Stewart Lee.These and others form a rolling castlist for the BBC’s many radio and TV  and sketch shows, trotting out the same takes to approving titters from audiences apparently bussed in en-masse from North London.A few weeks ago, after enduring a standard Have I Got News For You anti-Brexit fest, I turned over to watch Mock The Week on BBC to see host Dara O Briain tell a list of Malaysian heritage he wouldn’t be welcome in the Brexit Party .I vented about it on Twitter because whatever you think of the Brexit Party, it has been notably erse since its inception. O Briain’s lazy smear made no sense.It quickly transpired the one Malaysian-born person to achieve senior elected office in the UK is Christina Jordan, who is the Brexit Party’s MEP for Gibraltar and the South West.Soon she was giving O Briain an ear-bashing.His retort was that he got a laugh from the studio audience because that was what they thought of the Brexit Party.No wonder, eh Even some of those on the BBC’s roster have clocked that their unormity of outlook might be a problem.Brigstocke spoke in  of the shock of seeing audience members walk out of his show during his anti-Brexit segment when he took it on tour round the country.But comedy as a whole shows few signs of coming to terms with the case for more erse thinking.Most of us not on the Left do not close our minds to the possibility of those we disagree with still being funny.The late Jeremy Hardy’s Tory takedowns on Radio ’s The News Quiz were brilliant.But most comics don’t work hard enough to offer such original material.Jo Brand’s joke about battery acid being thrown over politicians is a case in point.We get she probably doesn’t really wish that on anyone. It is another way for her to say she doesn’t like particular politicians.We knew that.Thankfully, salvation is at hand.An independent sector is sprouting up, taking advantage of social media and hosting free-thinking comedy nights.Lee Hurst, a veteran whose broadcast career was curtailed for not being reliably left-wing, is a patron of the scene.In performers such as Williams, Norcott, Evans and Titania McGrath satirist Andrew Doyle — plus free-wheeling left-wingers such as Francesca Martinez and American Rob Delaney — we see the makings of a new alternative-comedy scene.Seek them out, ditch the BBC and have a laugh.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have accepted the result and I support Boris’s deal. The country must move on.It is fundamental to democracy that we implement the will of the people. Yet too many MPs have forgotten they promised to abide by the people’s decision.They spent three years trying to frustrate the result. Now they want to waste the next five doing the same.Every time one of the ultra-Remainers’ spurious claims is defeated, they invent another.They said Boris could not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and Brussels would not budge. Boris stood his ground and proved them wrong.Now they say we will face a new clf-edge No Deal at the end of next year unless a trade deal is completed with the EU.But there is no comparison with what faced us before. We will have left the EU by then.Two big concerns — citizens’ rights and Northern Ireland — will have been dealt with.It is true that time will be tight. For that we can blame the MPs who did everything in their power to delay our exit.But Boris has proved he is an effective negotiator. Both sides want a trade deal and our economies are already aligned, making agreement easier.With a working majority, Boris’s hand will be stronger and the job will be done. Ultra-Remainers have conjured up this new No Deal spectre because they are desperate.They know thatBoris wins the General Election, we will leave the EU by the end of January and the game will be up.Their second referendum campaign is in tatters and the Liberal Democrats’ pledge to revoke Brexit has bombed.The clock is counting down to an election that could settle the issue once and for all. So they are resorting to ever-more ludicrous claims.So-called moderates should be ashamed of the insults they are hurling at Boris.It is absurd to call his agenda “far-right” or “extreme”.This language should be reserved to describe hateful movements such as the BNP or the National Front.It should not be casually thrown around by fools who have been so blinded by their hatred of Brexit they have lost all sense of proportion.Boris was a successful Mayor of London who won a second term and delivered for the public.His plans to boost funding for schools and the NHS, for more police and to increase the National Living Wage, are clearly mainstream.When Boris calls for tougher sentences for violent criminals, he is speaking squarely for the millions of quiet Brits who share these views.They hate being branded as extremists by metropolitan elitists who have lost touch with everyday concerns.Liberal Conservatives like me are entirely comfortable supporting today’s party.I have marched alongside Boris for gay rights. I have heard him speak passionately about protecting the environment. I have walked down streets and seen him connect with people like no other politician can.I cannot understand how anyone who previously called themselves a Conservative could bring themselves to urge people to vote against the party at this election.That is tantamount to saying Jeremy Corbyn should be PM.These Tory turncoats justy themselves by claiming Brexit will damage the economy. But the public rejected that argument when they voted for Brexit.And you can’t warn about jobs and investment while being willing to allow the catastrophic impact of a government led by Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.Never in my letime have I seen an agenda like Labour’s today: Ruinous nationalisation spending pledges the country cannot begin to pay for theof crushing union power a leader who has consistently sided with our country’s enemies and who refuses to tackle endemic racism in his own party.This isn’t the loony left. It is the lethal left.It is a blood-red recipe to crash the economy, impoverish our public services and relegate Britain to a third-rate power.No moderate should even consider supporting it. One by one, former Labour MPs are calling out Corbyn, warning us of the dangers.Why can’t the ultra-Remainer former Tory MPs and muddled old warhorses like Lord Heseltine, who once understood the threat of socialism, see it Blinded by their hatred of Brexit, they say the election offers a Hobson’s choice between two extremes.That is hogwash. There is no equivalence between Corbyn’s hard-left programme and Boris’ mainstream Conservative agenda.Evenyou want the referendum result reversed, which most people do not, a neo-Marxist in No cannot be a price worth paying.It is time for those who call themselves moderates to wake up and realise the truly extreme step would be to help make Corbyn PM next week.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do not allow history to become a deafening silence. Save the memory.Although the German leader has visited other concentration camps, this is her first visit to the Nazi site.The concentration camp was constructed in the suburbs of the Polish city Oświęcim, near the modern nations southern border, in .In total, an estimated . million people were sent to Auschwitz – and at least . million of these died.Around  per cent of the dead were Jewish, representing approximately a sixth of all Jews killed in the Holocaust.The rest of the inmates were comprised of Polish and Soviet prisoners, thousands of Romany people and an unknown number imprisoned for being homosexual."},{"url":null,"title":"sun photographer shortlist underwater","story":"Richard Pelhams take of British slalom canoeist Mallory Franklin is one of  awe-inspiring images to make the final cut.They include visceral moments of sporting triumphs, natural beauty and architectural finesse taken from all around the globe.Director Hugo Donnithorne-Tait described the standard of photography as breathtaking.A month-long vote is now underway for the public to choose their favourite for the  winner.From cheese-rolling to deep es, imitations of art and le, heres a taster of the super snaps below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But how can you not have a table How do you eat  Where do you have coffee  What do you put your shopping on when you come home  And where do you sityou want to read something  Which brings me on to another astonishing fact. Today, in Britain, , children do not own a single book.Obviously, I’m aware that children would much rather shoot an alien in the face than read some drivel by Jane Austen. And I get that. I’d rather gouge my own eyes out with a trowel than read anything by Jane Austen. And I’d certainly rather play Call Of Duty.I’ll admit, too, that book people spend far too much time being bookish and earnest with other book people. Which is why the book that wins the Booker Prize is always more impenetrable than a Hawthorn bush.It’s usually just a lot of women wondering about flowers. Have I read either of this year’s joint winners  No. I’d rather eat my own sick. But the idea of living in a house with no books at all is actually quite frightening.Because then there’d be no Winnie The Pooh, and more worryingly, no Jack Reacher.They’ve tried to capture the essence of this man mountain on television and, hilariously, with Tom Cruise in the role at the cinema, but nothing beats the books. They’re all the same. Jack walks into a small town in America. He has some coffee. Notices a pretty girl. Punches eight men in the face. Sleeps with the pretty girl. Saves the town from the baddies by punching them all in the face and then walks off at the end.I swear to God thatyou could get your kids to put down their phones for a day, and read a Jack Reacher book, they’d never want to do social media again. I know that’s impossible. I know you can’t get a kid to put down its phone for more than  seconds. I’m just saying thatyou could . . .So what about school  Kids are made to read by teachers, but the books they select are always as dull as being dead. Andyou make kids read boring books for exams, they will grow up to hate reading.So ditch Austen and Donne and Shakespeare and Milton. Put them on the top shelf of a library and leave them there. Instead, to make reading fun, make them study Jack Reacher and books by Jilly Cooper and Jeffrey Archer.Even EL Jamesthat’s what it takes. Anything that gets them reading. Anything that makes books cool. It won’t work for everyone of course. Some kids will not enjoy a book no matter how good the story might be.But that’s OK. They can go off and do carpentry instead. Then they could make the family a table.APPARENTLY,  people complained about a raunchy appearance by the Pussycat Dolls on last weekend’s X Factor final.Some say the performance was “shameful” while others said the “strip show” was “absolutely disgraceful”.I couldn’t agree more. We sat through a rubbish song and at the end, they were wearing exactly the same amount of clothing as they had been at the start.But almost all of them these days are NEVER seen in public without a phone in one hand and . . . a plastic bottle of water in the other.I don’t know when it became compulsory to have water about your person at all times, but it’s stupid.Yes. You need wateryou are in the desert and you’re hundreds of miles from a tap and it’s C.But at all other times, you should drink beer.Because that comes in a glass bottle that doesn’t end up wrapped round some poor unfortunate sea creature’s head.AFTER about three hours my back bottom went to sleep but the rest of me was still gripped by Martin Scorsese’s new epic, The Irishman.Mostly, however, I was gripped by how badly the phenomenally expensive de-ageing technology works.It’s used in flash- backs to turn ageing stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino into younger men but it makes them look like Bill and Ben.And their plastic faces are at odds with their elderly bodies.Pity. I was rather hoping we could use tech like this in the next Grand Tour to make me look like Charles Leclerc.It’s reckoned that David has climbed  places in the list of most popular boys’ names thanks to the work done by David Attenborough.Really. But what about those who are naming their kids after David Cameron, or David Jason Or even the popular television channel.That’s what I’d doI had another kid.Call it Amazon. Good name actually.I SEE Q Branch has fitted James Bond’s rebuilt Aston Martin DB with mini guns that pop out from behind the headlights.That’s excellent, as a brace of these fearsome weapons can fire , rounds a minute. That’s  every second.The trouble is, that they can’t. I once flew a helicopter that had been fitted with miniguns on its skids and every time I pulled the trigger, one bullet would set off in the wrong direction and then the gun would jam.There’s another issue too. If Bond’s car carries enough bullets for two minutes of sustained fire, he’d need , bullets. Which together would weigh around ,lb. Oh, and the ammo storage box would be huge, too.These, then, are weapons that only really work on the screen. When they’re not actually firing anything at all.ELDERLY residents in the seaside town of Bournemouth started a petition as soon as they heard that a “pot shop” was due to open in their community.They said: “The area already struggles massively with anti-social behaviour and the last thing the community needs is an establishment promoting the use of narcotics right opposite impressinable youngsters.”Couple of things on that. They spelled “impressionable” wrong. And more importantly, the pot shop that had got them so riled was going to sell . . . pottery.This is a bit like that story from a while ago where angry locals daubed slogans and smashed windows of the house of the local paediatrician.Because they thought the brass plaque on the door said “paedophile”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not true this time: it is the MOST IMPORTANT VOTE in our letimes.At stake is whether we leave the EU or not. You may think that was settled by the Brexit referendum — and it should have been. But any result other than a Tory majority will lead to more efforts to overturn the referendum result.It will mean another year when politicians argue about whether to accept what people voted for in June , rather than focusing on schools, hospitals and all the other domestic issues that matter so much.There are TWO POSSIBLE RESULTS in this election: a Tory majority or another hung Parliament. Even John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, is talking about how Labour would try to governit didn’t have a majority.Another hung Parliament would be more of the same: Parliamentary gridlock and no progress. What would a Parliament without a majority for any party be able to agree on beyond a second referendum It is not even certain it could do that. You would need a government for a second referendum and Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said she would rather have another election than put either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn into No.So we may well all be heading to the polls AGAIN in Februarythere is no clear result this time. Eventhey could unite on a second referendum, they wouldn’t be able to agree on much . It would be a single-issue government, to the detriment of everything .When Labour make extravagant promises it has a double credibility problem. First, how will it pay for them  It is not realistic to say you can fund spending equivalent to half an NHS every year just by taxing the rich and big business a bit more.Second, will they actually happen given that Labour won’t win a majority  In a hung Parliament, Labour will only be able to do those things that Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats agree to.By contrast, a Tory majority government would not be more of the same. It would break the Brexit deadlock. This country would leave on January . This will not settle the question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it will mean that Brexit won’t continue to suck up all of Parliament’s energies.A majority government is also more easily held to account. If the Tories win one, then at the next election voters will be able to seethey have delivered on what they said that would do: There will  be no excuses and no hiding places. Right now, the Tories are on course for a majority. I understand their own internal numbers indicate a working majority.But these margins are very fine, and victory could slip awayvoters don’t turn out. If Boris Johnson does win a majority next week, it will be because he has presented himself as change. Not just the person who can break the deadlock, but a leader with a dferent agenda to the one the Tories have had these past nine years.As Prime Minister of a majority government, he would have to deliver on that agenda. He would have to create the conditions for the economy to flourish far outside London and the South East, he would have to improve the NHS and our infrastructure.Having been elected as a dferent kind of Tory, he will have to govern as that. This country has been in limbo for too long. It needs a Parliament that can take decisions, not just play for time.According to one campaign source: “There is still a nervousness about letting it run wild.”But there is a recognition that the Tories  need a bit of pizzazz in the last few days and that Boris  needs, “the energy of a walkabout”.The Tory plan is to “close hard”. They are, privately, cautiously optimistic.One Cabinet minister says: “In  you could feel it slipping away, it doesn’t feel like that this time.”But they have held back nearly all their online advertising budget for the last few days to guard against any last-minute swing back to Labour.FEW expected Donald Trump to be able to resist getting involved in the election on his visit here for the Nato summit.But in the end, Trump, largely, kept his views to himself.I understand that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was key in persuading him not to derail Boris Johnson’s election effort.Kushner, who has a leading role at the White House, developed a good relationship with Johnson when the latter was Foreign Secretary and was keen not to have the visit create any distractions.If he doesn’t, we will  have a second referendum where voters will be asked to choose between Remain and Remain-lite. Nigel Farage is badly miscalculating in his refusal to tell voters in Labour Tory marginals to back the Tories.If Labour hold on in seats such as High Peak in Derbys, it will be because of the Brexit Party standing in a seat that it has no chance of winning.One veteran Eurosceptic who has been part of an effort to get the Brexit Party to make clear that voters shouldn’t back it where it has no chance of winning blames Richard Tice, the Brexit Party chair and its candidate in Hartlepool, for blocking any such move.This source tells me Tice is “a nightmare, he is a far bigger problem than Farage”.This election is going to come down to fine margins. The Brexit Party vote could well let Labour hang on in some crucial seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Moments when things come together — or when they fall apart.Moments that define history and set the course of the future.We all remember Gareth Southgate’s heartfelt celebrations last summer and that Eric Dier penalty.We slightly overlook how close the keeper was to saving it. Thankfully he didn’t and we put years of penalty heartbreak behind us.In politics, one of those moments is coming next Thursday.We can either deliver Brexit and move forward with a Conservative majority Government, or we can have more Brexit delay, more arguing in Parliament, and two more referendums in  under Jeremy Corbyn. Next Thursday, I’m asking many dferent people to come on a journey with me. People who always vote Conservative. People who used to but lost faith. People who never have before.All of you who do are putting your trust in me. And I don’t take that lightly at all. Yet I feel so positive about our future as a country outside the EU. There’s so much we can achieve as well as lots we need to improve too.It won’t always be easy. We won’t always agree. But together I really believe we can do it. So come with me on that journey. Let’s unleash our potential. Let’s get Brexit done. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear how preposterous the audience found it.He then claimed, absurdly, that socialism has a better record than capitalism for raising the poor’s living standards.That will be news to Venezuela, which Corbyn once hailed as an ideal ­economic model but which is now a ­living hell of starvation and squalor.Boris was simply more convincing and more statesmanlike. Corbyn, even in a suit, is still the same old backbench crank nursing -year-old grievances.It is incredible anyone would consider putting him in power.THE smearing of Boris as a racist by a Channel  “mistake” is an outrage.We pray it was not deliberate. The channel’s journalists make no secret of their loathing for the Tories.Its news chief branded Boris a liar and presenter Jon Snow likes to chant “f*** the Tories”.Assuming it was a genuine error, what does it say about the culture of a ­supposedly impartial TV network that no one questioned it How did this happen  TV chiefs must come clean.The channel’s apology came too late to stop Corbyn’s Twitter trolls spreading it.Six days from the most crucial election in a letime, it’s a sacking offence.IT is time for the men in white coats to wheel off John Major, Tony Blair and their europhile has-been mates to a safe space where they can gibber together out of harm’s way.Brexit derangement has so utterly confused and consumed them that they are now campaigning against a Tory victory — and thus for the only alternative: a Marxist-run Corbyn coalition.They somehow prefer the immediate economic harm and global shock of that to a stable Tory Government delivering on the majority’s democratic will.These old men simply cannot cope with their defeat three years ago and seek vengeance on those who beat them.They really are that barking. GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The pair faced off in an hour-long challenge on the BBC over terror, tax, the NHS and their plans for spending.As usual Boris Johnson made a string of claims about both Labouraposs claims and his own. But as usual, not all of those claims were in fact true.From Labouraposs tax plans to the partyaposs record on security, Mr Johnson trotted out a string of claims which just donapost entirely stand up to scrutiny.Weaposve debunked his usual whoppers about , more nurses and  new hospitals before - you can read our explanations here. But here are six new claims he made that left us scratching our heads. On Labouraposs tax plans  WHAT HE SAID: I think itaposs quite incredible that Mr Corbyn should claim that people on £, a year are amongst the richest in society and therefore deserve to be clobbered by his tax increases.THE FACTS:Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to raise Income Tax only on people who earn more than £,, not £,. Itaposs true that the IFS think tank has said that, in or order to afford Labouraposs spending plans, at some point lower earners will be affected in some way. But itaposs not clear where this £, figure has come from - and £k earners are in the top % of income tax payers in the UK.  WHAT HE SAID: Heaposs proposing to put in a Home Secretary in the form of Diane Abbott whoaposs called for MI to be disbanded.THE FACTS: Diane Abbott signed an Early Day Motion calling for the abolition of MI in , but said more than two years ago that her views had changed.

On a Brexit deal being ready to go WHAT HE SAID: Asked aposyou donapost know you could do a trade deal with the EUapos, he replied: On the contrary, we have a fantastic deal. It is there, ready to go.THE FACTS: The deal Boris Johnson has aposready to goapos is a withdrawal, not a trade deal. The latter is much tougher - one between the EU and Canada took seven years - andwe donapost get it by the end of December , weaposll still leave the EU with no deal.On getting Brexit out of Parliament  WHAT HE SAID: The great beauty of this deal is it gets Brexit done, gets it out of Parliament, stops the wrangling, stops the chaos and moves us forward.THE FACTS: In February  the government promised a role for Parliament in scrutinising future Free Trade Agreements to be struck around the world after Brexit.

Unlike under the original bursary scheme - which the Tories scrapped in  - nurses in training will still have to pay tuition fees on their courses.WHAT HE SAID: Delaying Brexit is costing this country an extra billion pounds a month.THE FACTS: This cost is only when compared to a no-deal Brexit, in which the UK refuses to pay any orce bill.

Kudos to Corbyn for hammering Johnson and the Conservativesapos abysmal record over the past nine years on health, nursing, social care, police cuts and probation privatisation. Kudos too for stating thereaposs no conflict between protecting us against terrorists, murderers and rapists and respecting our human rights.

Labour marooned , behind hasn’t a cat in hell’s chance of winning in London’s Richmond Park and North Kingston where I live. Lib Dem Sarah Olney needs only several dozen of Labour’s , voters holding their noses to overturn Zac Goldsmith’s wafer-thin  majority and Boris Johnson’s lost a seat. So I’ll do my bit for the democratic socialist revolution by helping deprive Johnson of a Tory majority, hopefully opening Downing Street’s gates to Red Jezza. Lib Dems must do the same by voting Labour in Labour constituencies or areas where Labour’s secondthey wish to stop Brexit.

Nor is there any suggestion that Labour were aware the documents were being used by Russia as part of a disruption attempt. The documents had been posted online some months previously, and had already been reported in the Daily .Meanwhile, Boris Johnson continues to refuse to publish a Parliamentary report on Russian influence campaigns, repeatedly insisting there is no evidence of Russian interference in UK politics.“There is no evidence for that,” he said in November. “And I think we have got to be very careful before we simply cast aspersions of everybody who comes from a certain country just because of their nationality.” In a post published last night, Reddit’s security team said they believed the leaked documents were “part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.”They linked the accounts to a project dubbed “Secondary Infektion” by the Atlantic Council - which had previously been identied by Facebook on their .The project is said to be a follow up to the “Infektion” project operated by the KGB in the s which sought to spread he  claim that HIV AIDS had been the result of US government experiments. Reddit’s security team said: “Suspect accounts on Reddit were recently reported to us, along with indicators from law enforcement, and we were able to confirm that they did indeed show a pattern of coordination. “We were then able to use these accounts to identy additional suspect accounts that were part of the campaign on Reddit. “This group provides us with important attribution for the recent posting of the leaked UK documents, as well as insights into how adversaries are adapting their tactics.”  As well as two accounts which posted the NHS trade documents, other accounts posted claims about North Korean nuclear operations and about Ukraine being on the brink of nuclear disaster.Another account posted claims about Donald Trump having fallen out with British intelligence services. And one account claimed to have documents showing Spanish security services had evidence of an attempt on Boris Johnson’s le by “radical opponents of Brexit who seek to prevent him from being appointed prime minister of the country.”Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said it was extremely serious that the leaked documents could be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign. Speaking to BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Ms Morgan said: I understand from what was being put on that website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference. Andthat is the case, that obviously is extremely serious. And actually as Culture Secretary, obviously one of the things that we are looking for and monitoring is any interference in our elections. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald renewed calls for the Government to allow a report detailing Russian interference in UK elections to be published. He said: If we want to get to the bottom of the extent to which the Russian state interferes in elections, can we please publish the Intelligence and Security Committee report  Letaposs get that out there.

So itaposs only natural that pollsters YouGov ran a snap poll of viewers on who they thought won. As you could probably have guessed, the result sums up the utter stasis of our politics in the most depressing way possible. Excluding donapost knows, Johnson won % of viewersapos votes while Corbyn won % - the same split as the Brexit Remain vote three and a half years ago. YouGov said that, as this falls within the margin of error, it can be considered another draw.% said Johnson was more likeable compared to % for Corbyn. % said Johnson performed better on Brexit with % picking Corbyn.And % said Johnson was better on security compared to % on Corbyn. But there was a major upside for Labour backers as % said Corbyn came across as more trustworthy - compared to just % backing Johnson. And a whopping % of those polled said Corbyn performed better on the NHS, compared to just % picking Johnson - who was picked apart over his dodgy pledges for more nurses and hospitals. YouGov polled , viewers during the debate.Chris Curtis, YouGov’s Political Research Manager, said: “Our snap poll shows that the public remains ided on who won the debate, just as with last monthaposs head-to-head. With most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won, and very few people changing their minds. But given the Conservatives went into this debate in the lead, they will hope the lack of a knockout blow means they can maintain this until voting day. BBC host Nick Robinson oversaw only the second - but final - head-to-head debate of the  general election campaign between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn . After telling a string of half-truths himself, Boris Johnson gave a cringeworthy response to one of the  audience members who asked what should happen to politicians who lie during an election. As audience members laughed he stuttered that they should be made to go on their knees through the chamber of the House of Commons, scourging themselves with copies of their offending documents. But one audience member heckled: Go on then! Go on then! With less than a week to polling day, Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson of a failure of leadership for using racist remarks adding: I hope the Prime Minister understands the hurt people feel. And he said: Don’t ignore the fact that million of our children are living in poverty - the inequality has got worse. The Labour leader warned of chaos and huge job lossesa Tory government was unable to get a free trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.  And he urged the Prime Minister to listen to the message of the father of murdered Jack Merritt - who warned him not to politicise the London Bridge attack to push through harsher sentences. When the leaders were asked about balancing the needs of security against human rights against in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack, Mr Corbyn said: What happened on the streets of London was utterly appalling and I very moved by what Jack Merrittaposs father said about what his son was trying to do. That he wanted a society where you did address the huge problems where somebody committed awful acts, of course, you must imprison them of course you try and rehabilitate themyou can. Mr Johnson said: I have huge sympathy for Mr Merritt and the ... families of both victims and it was an absolutely terrible thing. But I still think itaposs wrong that someone like Usman Khan who was sentenced  years or  years plus five on licence should have been out automatically on eight years. Elsewhere, Jeremy Corbyn hit back at Boris Johnsonaposs claims that the NHS is not on the table in future trade deals with the US. During the leadership debate the Labour leader was challenged on his assertion thatthere was a deal with America then Brits would face five-figure bills for cancer treatment. Mr Corbyn asked the Prime Minister why negotiations had taken two yearsMr Johnson was telling the US that the NHS was not for sale. He said: The Prime Minister says heaposs not going to do that kind of trade deal. If thataposs the case, why did the talks go on for two years  It doesnapost take two years to say no to privatisation of the NHS.  The hour-long clash came after a torrid day for the Prime Minister as former PM John Major told voters to back Independents over the Tories in the election. Tony Blair declared thank God for John Major! at an anti- Brexit rally tonight as a video message from Sir John said next weekaposs vote is the final chance to affect Brexit. During the debate Mr Johnson said he would not condemn Sir John as a “has-been” but added: “Unlike Mr Major I lead a party that is now totally united.” Host Nick Robinson shot back: “Totally united because you got rid of everybody you didn’t agree with!” Mr Johnson insisted all of his candidates backed his Brexit deal. But Jeremy Corbyn said it would take seven years for Mr Johnson to negotiate a trade deal adding: “What he will do is walk out of a relationship with the EU into a relationship with nobody.” Meanwhile the PM was left reeling after BBC interviewer Andrew Neil lambasted him for refusing to be grilled by the him on primetime TV. Mr Johnson pulled out of a visit to a pub in Kent after protesters turned up and he was branded a chicken. Jeremy Corbyn went on the attack, unleashing a fresh set of documents which he claimed shattered Mr Johnsonaposs pledge there will be no checks on goods going to Northern Ireland. In the debate Boris Johnson tried to turn the tables on Jeremy Corbyn - saying it was slightly curious…to be lectured about the union by a man who “supported for four decades the IRA”. But Jeremy Corbyn shot back: How about the Prime Minister showing a degree of honesty about the arrangements he’s actually made with Northern Ireland  We now know there are restrictions. He should and could have said it at the time.  Boris Johnsonaposs claims he would get Brexit done by January were unpicked by Nick Robinson as the host pointed out he would only get out - not negotiate a trade deal. Mr Johnson claimed there was ample time to get a trade deal in  months despite a similar deal between the EU and Canada taking seven years. Jeremy Corbyn ran into his own problems however as, quizzed by an audience member, he did not guarantee Brexit would happen next year. Instead, asked directly, he said: “What I can guarantee is we’ll bring an end to this debate and have a final say for the people of this country.” And he restated Labouraposs pledge to negotiate a new deal within three months and a referendum between it and Remain in six months.

Four-month-old Georgina Addison was born deaf and had two hearing aids fitted when she was just a few weeks old, Wales Online reports. Every morning when her parents Paul and Louise go to wake her up, they switch on her hearing aids and watch as she shows her happiness. In the footage, little Georgina can be seen smiling and laughing when she hears her mumaposs voice after the aids are switched on. Her father, a communication manager from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said it “fills his heart with joy” every time he turns on Georgina’s hearing aids each morning. He said: It’s like she’s having the lights switched on and she can hear her mum’s voice. “She is instantly delighted and becomes much happier straight away. “Her face lights up and she looks delighted. “For us as parents it is a true delight for us too.  “It fills my heart with joy and you just can’t put a price on things like this. “Every morning she reacts like it’s a completely new experience and that will never get old.” Paul and HR manager, Louise, discovered first-born Georgina was deaf shortly after she was born in August. Initial audiology tests identied hearing issues and the family were referred to see a specialist audiologist.  Paul said: “Getting that sort of news is always going to be dficult. “We focused on the practicalities of the situation and did our best to stay positive.

The -year-old was staying in temporary accommodation with her son Bradley when she featured in a report into vulnerable and low-income voters in Grimsby. Her moving story led to an outpouring of support with a JustGiving page set up to support both her and the Rock Foundation foodbank reaching more than £, in a day before donations were closed. Pam Hodge, founder of the foodbank, told Grimsby Live that the money raised will provide much needed security to the food bank as it faces mounting demand for its services. She said: I really cannot believe how this has all taken off, I have just been manic for the past two days dealing with people wanting to make donations and do their bit to help. At the moment, £, has been raised, which will be donated to us and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, so that it can be used to help others. We are going to use £, of it to help Rachel get a new house sorted, with a deposit, along with some furniture and white goods. We will also be supporting some of the other people who were featured in the BBC report. The rest of the money that we receive, will all be used to support the food bank and the hundreds of other people we work with every week.  We will be able to restock our cupboards and even get some presents for local children and families who are struggling at this time of year, which will hopefully help them out a big bit. Last month was a record month for the food bank, as more people were seeking their services than ever, many of whom are employed but their wages just do not stretch far enough. Pam said: Last month we handed out , food parcels from our food bank, which works out at around  a week. The array of people that our needing our support is immense, as we have everything from people struggling on zero hours contracts and universal credit to working professionals who are unable to afford food after paying their bills and asylum seekers. We are just hoping now that these donations will be able to make a real dference to the work that we do. Struggling Rachel toldthat she has suffered from depression  and is currently on Universal Credit.  Rachel had said she was overwhelmed with the support received from cplete strangers. She told Grimsby Live : I really didnapost expect for there to be this sort of reaction to the story, it really has overwhelmed me to the point that I just donapost know what to do. I am not used to people who I have never met before want to help me, and it will take me a bit of time to get my head around it all and process things. If people want to help me though, I ask that it is all done through the Rock Foundation, who are going to help me with food, furniture and housing, and anything after that, they can use to help others and continue the work that they do. Rachel said: My depression got really bad and I wasnapost getting the help I needed. I didnapost get out of the house for three months. I just sat in my bedroom and it just escalated.  Thereaposs a lack of support, getting a doctoraposs appointment was dficult. You just get passed from pillar to post, from council to crisis team, to doctor.  And that gets you even more depressed. You keep telling people your situation and repeating yourself, and getting nowhere. Universal Credit  , which was introduced in  by the Tories, has made it a lot harder, Rachel says. She said: They should never have brought it in, itaposs the worst thing they did. Thereaposs that many people struggling on it. You are getting paid once a month,something happens in the middle of the month, you are in trouble. Itaposs harder to budget.    When it was fortnightly, you didnapost struggle so much or worry so much, you can budget for two weeks at a push, but not monthly.  In another cruel blow, Rachel was punished for missing a job seekeraposs appointment, which she claims she was unaware of because she does not have a phone or an internet connection. She claims her Universal Credit was sanctioned and a large amount being taken from her payment. Rachel added: Iaposm struggling with myself. I cry a lot, mainly when Iaposm on my own. But Iaposm getting there, Iaposve got a lot to focus on, I just donapost have the energy to do it. The mum said her son Bradley, who turns  this month, is the only thing she has to live for. He wanted a bicycle for his birthday, but his mum feared she wouldnapost make his wish come true. She added: As long as my son is eating, I can manage.

It can cost upwards of £, to gain access to the parties, itaposs claimed. Attendees who want access to private rooms can become annual members, but this sets them back £, per year. This Saturday, rich and famous guests are set to descend on Snctm’s ultra VIP mansion. Once inside, they “step into a world of intrigue and sensuality”. The exclusive venue provides the opportunity to explore your most hidden desires. And apparently, the sight of multiple bodies writhing together on the floor isn’t unusual.Unlike Snctm’s venue in Hollywood , the Miami location attracts a dferent crowd. A sex club insider revealed: “The event is always Snctm but the character is unique in each city. “Our attendees come from the  per cent of the  per cent. “In New York that means more bold-face names of business and finance, while in LA itaposs more A-list actors, musicians, celebrities. “Our Miami list so far Iaposm seeing a few more recording artists and professional athletes than the other cities normally see.” All the stops are pulled out for these music moguls and sports personalities.  Devotees are on hand to provide the entertainment – and for this event, their erotic performances draw inspiration from religion. The Snctm boss explains: “Itaposs a level of opulence and excess that other parties may try to imitate but cannot achieve. “Itaposs not for everyone. Itaposs not for most. Our parties are made for those who are used to experiencing refined pleasures. “Weaposre singular because our members are singular.” A sexy soiree organiser ulged: “Our events cultivate a level of comfort where our guests can open up and explore their deepest fantasies.  “Itaposs not uncommon that guests will be found writhing in beds of four, five, six beautul people. “I canapost speak of the activities they partake in but it encompasses every fantasy you can imagine - often times they surprise even me.” If news of the party has piqued your interest in Snctm, you might be wondering how you can become a member.

The -year-old women are fused together at the torso, with each controlling one side of their body. They learnt to work as one - walking and doing daily tasks that many thought they would never manage. But the pair have appeared in their own reality show and flourished into aspiring adults, claiming that although they have one body, they have two souls. Born on March , , in Minnesota, USA, their parents Patty and Mike had no idea they were even expecting twins. Doctors later realised that the twinsapos heads must have been perfectly aligned during the ultrasounds during Parryaposs pregnancy to give the appearance of a normal fetus developing. With poor prognosis at the time for conjoined twins, the girls were not expected to survive even the first night. But they have flourished, even going on to university where they achieved separate degrees.According to Time magazine the girls were born with five limbs - an extra arm growing between their heads - but this was removed during infancy.Although they discussed their options parents Patty and Mike never considered separating the girls, fearing that they would die or be left with severe disabilitiesit was attempted. Instead they encouraged the girls to develop their own minds.  Speaking when they were older, Abby said: We never wish we were separated because we would never be able to do all the things that we do now, like play softball, run and do sports. On their th birthday they passed their driving test - with both of them behind the wheel. Brittany told the Daily Mail at the time: Abby does the pedals and the gear shter. I take over the blinkers and the lights. But she likes driving faster than me. Speaking to the Daily Mirror back in  as their reality show began, the pair hoped it would prove to the world that they are totally dferent people with unique personalities, who share dreams of marriage and having children of their own. But they werenapost prepared to talk about their love le back then.  Brittany, the joker of the two, said: “The whole world doesn’t need to know who we are seeing, what we are doing and when we are going to do it. But believe me, we are totally dferent people.” Abby, the feisty stubborn one, added: “Yeah, we are going to be mums one day, but we don’t want to talk about how it’s going to work yet.” The pair graduated from Bethel University, each with their own degree, as they headed off for a career in teaching. They are now fth-grade teachers in the US, but they reportedly only get one salary. Speaking to the BBC, Abby said: Obviously right away we understand that we are going to get one salary because weaposre doing the job of one person.  As maybe experience comes in weaposd like to negotiate a little bit, considering we have two degrees and because we are able to give two dferent perspectives or teach in two dferent ways. With Brittany adding: One can be teaching and one can be monitoring and answering questions. So in that sense we can do more than one person.

He has been convicted of participating in the planning of two violent break-ins at properties in Lisbon and the nearby town of Cascais.State prosecutors had accused him of being a key player in an organised gang by giving accomplices information about victims and the target homes.The ex-cop, who left the Policia Judiciaria after a torture trial former Madeleine McCann chief investigator Goncalo Amaral was also implicated in, will remain a free man pending an appeal.It emerged Pereira Cristovao was facing trial in March when he played a prominent role in Netflix documentary The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann.He admitted involvement before the trial at a court in Cascais which ended last month with judges retiring to consider their verdicts.But he denied prosecution claims he was a gang ringleader and insisted after the guilty verdict yesterday he had been convicted of crimes including kidnapping which he had not committed.His defence lawyer told the hearing he had ed £, commission he had received for one of the raids, to a victim.All but one of the  defendants were convicted over the  raids, led by police officers with  search warrants who used the illegal operations to steal cash and other valuables.

Two police officers, both sacked before trial, were jailed for  and  years each.The alleged leader of a hooligan group, already behind bars and awaiting trial on accusations of a violent attack on Sporting Lisbon players during training, received a six year, four-month prison sentence.Prosecutors alleged Nuno Mendes, better known as Mustafa, received instructions from Pereira Cristovao and passed them on to a relative who then got the convicted police officers to carry out the raids.The ex-cop, a former president of Sporting Lisbon who has served as head of Portugal’s missing children agency, admitted after learning his fate he was “shocked and surprised.” He confirmed he would appeal.The -year-old has been a constant critic of Kate and Gerry McCann and called for them to be arrested for leaving their children alone in their Algarve holiday apartment after Madeleine vanished in May .He claimed in a  book called The Star of Madeleine that the toddler was dead and her body had been dumped at sea.His novel, based on the real police investigation which he claimed was hampered by interference from British authorities, ended with two fictional officers gazing out at the Atlantic Ocean following a huge land search. He mysteriously claimed two of the McCanns’ holiday pals - the so-called Tapas Seven - were “fundamental” to discovering the truth about Madeleine.The couple’s spokesman Clarence Mitchell called his comments ‘hurtful and distressing’ and accused him of trying to profit from the McCanns’ misfortune.Pereira Cristovao wrote his book ahead of his  trial for torturing the mum and uncle of a missing girl into making a  confession while he was still a PJ inspector.He went on to head Portugal’s association for missing children after being acquitted."},{"url":null,"title":"loyal dog filmed chasing owners","story":"NewsLoyal dog filmed chasing owners car after being abandoned in streetThe incident - which was filmed in Mexico City - shows the loyal pooch chasing after its owners car after it became clear they were trying to leave without itShareCommentsByAna Lacasa:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video loyal-dog-chases-owners-car-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news loyal-dog-filmed-chasing-owners-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Their adventure has been dubbed the “real-le Le of Pi” following the  movie in which a shipwrecked boy is inspired to live by a stowaway tiger. Disaster struck Maurice and Maralyn Bailey on their  trip from Southampton to New Zealand when their -ft yacht hit a whale and sank. With little food, and relying on rainfall when water ran out, they had to turn to sea creatures to survive, catching turtles and birds and using safety pins to hook fish. Yet despite this, hundreds of friendly animals approached the rubber raft, inc­­luding dolphins, sharks and whales. Filmmaker Alo Cerezo said: “Their story reminded me of Le of Pi.It felt like a fable where animals are the lead actors and ‘never lose hope’ is the moral.” In the film, Maurice, who died last Dec­­­­­ember, says: “After so many months with them, we felt just like sea creatures ourselves.The sea was our le, the animals were our neighbours.” After  weeks the pair, both three stone lighter, were rescued by Korean fishermen after drting , miles.  Their adventure was turned into the book  Days Adrt. But over time the story was forgotten and after Maralyn died in , Maurice was left alone. Alo, , from Malaga, Spain, had been fascinated by the Baileys since boyhood.In  he visited reclusive Maurice in Lymington, Hants, for interviews he turned into a documentary. He raised the alarm after Maurice stopped replying to emails. He was found dead inside his house.

could be bolstered for the visit to Easter Road today, according to assistant manager Tony Docherty.There was potentially good news on the injury front for the Premiership clash with Hibs.Both defender Andy Considine – taken off late in the - draw against Rangers after scoring the equaliser – and winger Niall McGinn, who suffered a calf strain last weekend after scoring the winner against St Mirren, are in line to .Docherty said: “Andy Considine picked up an injury and we had to take him off in the game, but he’s not showing any great signs .“It was just a knock he got on the hip which limited his mobility in the game.“He was in with the physios on Thursday and in for training yesterday.“We’re hopeful he’ll be ok.“We’re also hoping to have McGinn in contention as well.”However, central midfield duo Craig Bryson and Funso Ojo remain on the sidelines.Bryson’s struggles since signing in the summer have continued and he has another ankle injury, having been chopped down against St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park a couple of weeks ago.Ojo has been out since the home league game against Saints with a hamstring tear.The Dons management team again used defensive recruits Zak Vyner and Greg Leigh, alongside Lewis Ferguson, in the middle of the park against Rangers due to the duo’s absence.Docherty added: “They are the two biggest losses. It’s been the story of the season so far with our two marquee signingsyou like.“Hopefully Funso will be back next week and Bryson not long after.“With regards to that we’ve got to praise the squad.“It’s testament to the spirit of the players who’ve been asked to play out of position that we’ve got through and always remained competitive.“It shows the adaptability we have and that the manager always finds a way to make sure we’re competitive for every game.“None more so than the most recent game against Rangers.”Hibs’ undefeated run under new boss Jack Ross was ended on Wednesday as they fell - to Ross County in Dingwall.They sit  points behind the third-placed Dons in sixth.However, Docherty – who pointed to striker Christian Doidge’s run of seven goals in his last five outings – thinks the Dons must be wary of the home side’s attacking threatthey’re to keep up their own run, unbeaten in six league games.Docherty said: “The interim manager Eddie May put a front two in place and since Jack Ross has come in he’s carried on with that.“They’ve had a relative level of success with it, two wins, a draw and a defeat.“Hibs are a team when you analyse them who carry a potent attacking threat, with Doidge on nine goals.“Three of them, Doidge,Kamberi andAllan, have  goals between them.“You also identy weaknesses we can exploit.“I like Jack Ross and I think he’s come in and got results. It’s the same players, though – although it’s a dferent style of play.“We just need to focus on how our strengths can overcome their weaknesses.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him.

He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-saw-poverty-shocked-core-glasgow-1970s-worse","story":"My worst fear is a Tory majority which will almost certainly herald a No Deal BrexitJohnson sticks to his no extension pledge when even he is unable to magic the withdrawal agreement into a trade deal within his timescale.My best hope, a hung Parliament, there to nip his ankles and stymie in part the madness that is bound to unfold.Like many of you Brexit has become a background to daily le, as has did the run up to the election.

And suddenly. Without a word. She turns and leaves. Taking my pasta away. Back deep into the bowels of this staggeringly huge restaurant which tonight, a Wednesday, is absolutely heaving, jumping, packed-full, people talking, eating, gesturing, some still waiting at the door, queueing. Pastas being forked, flipped, slurped, dripped, even dropped while mine is leaving on a bloody jet plane. Donrsquot know when it will be back again.ldquoWTF Irsquom in the middle of saying to absolutely nobody because tonight, Matthew, Irsquom eating all alone. At a tiny leper table near the entrance.Then another waitress spots my speech bubble and chases the first one down. A discussion takes placehellipthe pasta still inching stubbornly towards that massive open kitchen so far away, so obscured by standing, sitting, yapping, eating humanity that not once tonight will I get a clear view of it.Hang on, the pastas are swinging back again. Returning. Bobbing, weaving, arriving in a crash landing before me, no explanation, or apology from the first waitress. A wry smile from the second. Sigh.As a result of this mad episode Irsquom going to have to order another pasta later because one thing about pasta that is an absolute fact  It needs to be piping hot when it gets to the table. Steam rising, sauces still sliding, slithering and slipping into shape. And this definitely ainrsquot.Still, Sugo here is the searingly hottest ticket in town. The owners of the undoubtedly brilliantly successful Paesano restaurants trying to do that impeccably-sourced, authentically made and astonishingly cheap thing they did with pizza to pasta.Crikey, fresh hand-made pasta  On this scale: Revolutionary. They donrsquot even eat that in Italy. Only kidding, though outside the home itrsquos nowhere near as available as you would think. For good reasons, not least that the dried stuff is pretty great anyway, and not nearly as risky to handle.What is it like then  Honestly  A hit and a good few misses. Little origami parcels of agnolotti, stuffed with nicely balanced veal, potato and cavallo nero, draped in salty buttery thyme  Pleasant, reasonably good pasta.Then a Jamie Oliver-esque bowl-shaped dome of fine-ish tagliarini, all speckled with reds and green, crumbled with pangratto, pretty, hot with chilli and sold at an almost unbelievable fiver  Hmm. Dry, utterly tasteless, a little sticky in parts and disappointing but also fabulously meaty, superbly deep ragu, chunks of unctuous beef, the pappardelle pasta folded like ribbons of silk, probably the most suitable for serving freshly-made of the dishes Irsquoll have tonight. Itrsquos very good, though a few strands are stuck together. But this I would definitely have again.Now, Irsquod heard they have a problem with portion sizes in here. And I think they already know that. The waitress certainly told me right off that servings are  grams, so maybe three plates for two people. Strange.Surprising, then, to see that  grams on the plate looks like itrsquos way more than enough. A big portion but in the same way pasta doesnrsquot hold its heat like pizza, pasta doesnrsquot fill like pizza. And I find I can easily handle another dish just to see what itrsquos like when served piping hot.The spaghetti, then, with clams and white wine. Theyrsquore good at the sauces in here, definitely, but that springy, bouncy, under this light yellowy, curly spaghetti  That looks like the awful stuff they sell in bags in supermarkets. I donrsquot warm to it. At all. Dried pasta, at Molisana say, would have been better.Despite all this: what Sugo are trying is actually, genuinely, pretty revolutionary. Some of it I think they have got wrong but maybe enough of the whole package they have got right.Sugo Pasta Mitchell StreetGlasgowNo bookingsMenu: Itrsquos pasta but not as you know it ndash all freshly made this very day and thatrsquos a pretty revolutionary and hugely interesting idea.  Service: Itrsquos all a bit bish-bosh, tables being shouted, people being shunted and I had a very odd experience, probably because I was eating alone and ordered two dishes.  Atmosphere: Absolutely bursting with the excitement and anticipation of the moment and all the more fun to be there. Great vibe.  Price: Just like their Paesano pizza restaurants the secret weapon is the fabulously clever pricing with a bowl of tagliarini from just a fiver, and most dishes under a tenner.  Food: Great concept, very good sauces, the fresh pastas are a hit or a miss and possibly need an overall rethink but as this is a brave, new world, I hope they succeed.

Few of us,we were being honest, really believed these were lies exaggeration: perhaps grandstanding: definitely, but not a deliberate attempt to swap a known hood for a universally-accepted fact.As the  General Election campaign enters its final week it is now routinely described by commentators and politicians alike as \"rancorous\", \"unpleasant\" and \"bitter\". In truth, though, itrsquos not really been much more obnoxious than most others in our letimes. Social media tends to amply prickliness and makes it monstrous. That which we once considered only to be disagreeable now becomes disgusting. Perhaps this is what happens when thousands of us now find we can take to the stage and think that only by shouting the loudest can our voices be heard in a crowded market-place.What has made this election unique in my letime is how simplistic to an almost insulting degree has been the offering of the UK Government. When the optimistic investment numbers and shaky NHS promises are stripped away it comes down to one slogan: Get Brexit Done.This flies on the deception that our withdrawal from the EU can be wrapped up before the Christmas trees come down and that everything will be back to normal before next summer. It omits to provide the truth of the two yearsof tough negotiations with a sullen EU on future trading arrangements conducted on a painstaking case-by-case, sector-by-sector basis. It asks us to accept that the US will be falling over itself to be charitable in cutting a beneficent trade deal. It long ago ceased even trying to deny predictions of economic hardship in Britainrsquos most disadvantaged communities. It dismisses concerns that any part of the NHS will be on the table when the Americans come knocking. Aye, right! These may not be outright lies but they rely on concealing all relevant data to those who are most at risk from its adverse effects.If it prevails on December  the duplicitous and infantile nature of Boris Johnsonrsquos personal manesto will make the isions between Scotland and England deeper than they have ever been. Even in this age when we are too ready to reach for extremes and ultimates the dferences have become a chasm. By the time this one is over six elections will have been conducted in Scotland since , encompassing Holyrood, Westminster, local authorities and the European Parliament. The previous five have all ed resounding victories for the SNP campaigning for self-determination and, latterly, a second referendum on independence. This one will follow that pattern. Wersquove also had a referendum on membership of the EU which overwhelmingly rejected what Englandrsquos heart desires. This though, only hints at the cultural, philosophical and political chasm which now exists between Scotland and our great southern neighbours across more sectors than we could ever have previously imagined.This is not to say that Scotland is better than England or that we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard merely that the governments either country has chosen to represent its peoplersquos aspirations regard humanity and human existence in starkly dferent ways. In Scotland our political instincts and legislation is geared towards providing options for the poor, the vulnerable, the excluded and those fleeing terror in other countries. In England, the Boris Johnson optionis to gain power at any cost and to hold it with every artice at his disposal. It discourages speaking truth to power but submerges truth with power.It relies on the confidence that comes with knowing that the main mass media outlets are strictly controlled by a handful of those whose best material interests are served by him or who attended the same school as him. He knows that no-one will look under the bonnet or ask for his workings. It constructs  enemies at home and abroad and stitches them up as the culprits for ills both real and imagined. As the challenges of Brexit begin to bite in those communities least equipped to deal with them the EU is already in the crosshairs of the backlash when it comes.In Scotland there can be valid criticism of the Scottish Governmentrsquos stewardship of the NHS and education but there are key dferences of attitude in these landscapes. In Scotland we want them to deliver for as many as possible and with no exceptions and the failures are of management and civil service incompetence. In Boris Johnsonrsquos England health is being set up to fail and thus to attract the predators of private equity.The great and humane system of care as devised by a great Welshman in England can now only be seen in Scotland. Here, a child has access to  hours of early learning and nursery care, saving families more than pound. In Scotland our students are provided with free tuition while those in England must find almost pound, a year. Prescriptions and care for the elderly are free. In Scotland we want to make the journey from the cradle to the grave as long and as comfortable as possible. In England in the grip of the Johnson regime the same journey will become shorter and more brutal as Brexit and Americarsquos big pharmaceutical companies gather to feed.By all means letrsquos get Brexit donethat is what England truly desires but let it soon be followed by Scottish independencewe truly desire decency and compassion."},{"url":null,"title":"peter-pan-house-one-worlds-coolest-places","story":"Moat Brae, where author JM Barrie played as a child, has long been credited as the place where he gained the inspiration to write the timeless childrenrsquos classic.Now the Georgian property has been named as one of the ldquocoolest places in the world to visit by Time magazine following its multi-million reinvention as Scotlandrsquos new National Centre for Storytelling and Childrenrsquos Literature.The house, in Dumfries, was selected as one of the  sites around the globe children must see.The building was saved from demolition a decade ago and has now been restored as an international visitor attraction.A campaign by the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trustto raise pound million for the renovation was spearheaded by actress and trust patron Joanna Lumley, and the house, which opened in the summer, now features on Timersquos Worldrsquos Coolest Places list for .The magazine said it had based its selections on ldquoquality, originality, sustainability, and accessibility.Describing Moat Brae, it said: ldquoIn , Moat Brae reopened as Scotlandrsquos National Centre for Childrenrsquos Literature and Storytelling.ldquoKids can run through the buildingrsquos enchanted gardens, enjoy the Lost Boysrsquo tree house and board a full-scale pirate ship.

A two-day symposium on the artist titled This Womanrsquos Work will take place at the Edinburgh College of Artin the capital next Thursday and Friday.Academics will be presenting papers to an audience of fellow academics and fans on topics ranging from gender subversion to folk horror in the Bushrsquos work.ldquoItrsquos not your stereotypical dry academic conference, said Dr Johnny Murray, one of the eventrsquos organisers. Bushrsquos biographerGraeme Thomson is also attending, as is photographer Max Browne who shot her  tour.Mr Murray, who is senior lecturer in film and visual culture at ECA, has put the symposium together with his colleague Dr Glyn Davis. They have previously arranged symposiums on the Pet Shop Boys and Grace Jones.The reason they have chosen to focus on Bush, he explained, is because she is ldquocompletely unique.He added: ldquoShe is incredibly curious, intellectually speaking. A lot of her work takes reference from other art forms. Wuthering Heights would be a great example of that.ldquoThroughout her career shersquos been influenced by literature, shersquos been influenced by cinema, shersquos been very powerfully influenced by dance and modern choreography. The only two tours shersquos done to date are both incredibly theatrical performance art-based works in and of themselves.ldquoThere are so many dferent facets to her. In technological terms and gender-based terms she has been a pioneer ndash one of the first women to take control of her career in the sense of taking a lead production role on her records.ldquoApart from the quality and complexity of the songwriting on albums like The Dreaming, The Hounds of Love and The Sensual World, just how she was using the recording studio at that time is a real inspiration.ldquoThose albums still remain a landmark in terms of how you use new technology to create particular kinds of sounds, he added.:Herald Diary -Kate Bush on the binsIf anything, he believes, her long absence from public view after the birth of her son Albert in  only increased the publicrsquos interest in her. ldquoPopular interest and celebration of her and her achievements has, in my mind, only intensied over the years since she came back with [album] Aerial in .ldquoShersquos been such an innovative and non-conformist artist.

Shersquos the antithesis of that old cliche, lsquoWe prefer her early work.rsquoAmong those speaking at the symposium is Samuel Love who has just graduated from ECA with a Masters by Research in History of Art. His paper, How Beautul It Is, Amongst All the Rubbish, will discuss the notion of Englishness in Kate Bushrsquos work.ldquoThe first thing people would associate with Kate Bushrsquos Englishness would probably be her reputation for eccentricity, Mr Love says. ldquoI couldnrsquot think of too many other national cultures that would give us something like Wuthering Heights as a breakout single.ldquoPersonally, though, I think the most important aspect of her Englishness runs deeper and has to do with the omnipresent nature of the countryside, standing in as a semi-magical and totally prelapsarian space of fantasy and innocence, in her music.:Review -Six Plays Inspired by the Songs of Kate Bush,ldquoI think that sense of spiritual reverence for place has a long history in English art and is one of the most prominent ways in which England is mythologised as a site of folklore and mysticism ndash itrsquos right there in the pagan woodland in Hounds of Love, the sequestered garden of Under the Ivy and the living, breathing country of Oh England, my Lionheart.The symposium will open on the same day as the General Election. ldquoWe will be having lsquoVote Katersquo badges made for all delegates, Mr Murray revealed. ldquoRegardless of political affiliations and disagreements we will all be presenting a united front with our lapel badges.A Kate Bush Symposium takes place at ECA, December -.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amADVERTORIAL: B Jasmine Terrace, Aberdeen Offers over £, Located off King Street, this ground-floor flat has a wide range of amenities within easy walking distance, including excellent shopping facilities, public transport services, Aberdeen University Kings College campus and the city centre.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But to be able to now officially say we have raised over twice the amount we set out to achieve is absolutely amazing. The donations came in thick and fast, and we are so grateful to all of those who contributed in any way. Orkney is a tremendously generous place, and the community has yet again come up trumps!#The rest of the money came in from donations from generous iniduals and businesses across the county, via a the newspaper or through The Orcadian website.“All of the money raised in this campaign will stay in Orkney, and is earmarked for this project, so we will very much look forward to seeing how the CLAN team get on with their plans.“They make such a dference to all of us who have been affected by cancer in any way, by giving advice, a supportive shoulder, support, therapies — even organising a roof over our heads during treatment.“They are truly amazing, and this money will mean that more people can benefit from the fantastic work they do.”#The monies raised, by the people of Orkney and further afield, through The Orcadian’s ‘OutreachCLAN’ appeal, will enable us to reach out to more people across the county who are affected by their own or someone ’s cancer diagnosis, and for that we are truly grateful.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mark Twain made it popular in America but mistakenly attributed it to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Apparently it originally came from an anonymous writer. At least that’s what it said on the internet, so it must be true, right Political spin and misinformation are nothing new, butfeels like the balance has tipped to the point where you genuinely cannot trust the majority of political information you see now on social media or hear on the television or radio – especiallyit comes from any of our main parties.: Nicola Sturgeon believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Tories getting majority: Jacob Rees-Mogg’s sister among Brexit MEPs quitting to back ToriesOutright political lies are now the norm. And I don’t knowwe can ever go back. Chancellor Sajid Javid was at it yesterdaymorning. He told Sky News that the  per cent rise in homelessness since  – when the Conservatives won a majority – was the fault of the Labour Party, who lost power in .The Conservatives have since issued a statement saying that he “misremembered” a statistic, but it was more that he got caught red-handed telling a flipping great fib. And Javid was meant to be one of the saner ones. But maybe there are none. And maybe we don’t want any.Feeding our biasesAll our political parties are indulging in the worst kind of deceit and manipulation. Spin and propaganda have always existed but when you genuinely need to fact check everything our political leaders say, you’re off to the wacky races.But do we actually care  Or are we so deeply polarised and entrenched in our camps that we are happy to feed our not-so-unconscious biases and feast on our daily diet of manipulated truth and misinformation  Do we even bother to fact-check anything as iniduals, or is that prospect as appealing as getting a new quote for your car insurance – because that may be something we all have to think about doing far more in the future.And there’s an interesting generational ide. According to new research by Intuit Research, the older you are, the less likely you are to fact-check a news story. Only  per cent of over-s polled said they would check facts to confirm the truth of a story, compared with  per cent of --year-olds.Given that older people are more likely to vote and lean towards the right and Brexit, you can see why the Tories are shamelessly pushing their fake news marketing to the limit. This is a vital voting group for them, and they are being ruthless.And it’s not just the Tories. Jeremy Corbyn has told us anti-semitism is all sorted. Jo Swinson has told us she’s going to be Prime Minister and is on course for a landslide.I don’t think there is way back. There never was a halcyon era in which the public had unwavering faith in what their politicians said, but we are now entering a Black Mirror world of wilful deception.I once did a  with Brian Stelter, who hosts the show Reliable Sources on America’s CNN. He said the art of fake news is to not tell a ludicrous lie. It was to gently shape the facts so they become what you want them to be.

The rail network is a gt to journalists, like no other area of transport, and not necessarily in a good way.While there are good news stories - like falling crime rates, and lowered fences for baby deer, to give recent examples - too often the industry attracts the opposite type of coverage.Shrinking coffee cupsApart from the perennial fare rises, delays and overcrowding - the booming railways are a victim of their own success - the industry has a propensity for repeatedly shooting itself in the foot.Like Network Rail’s failure to check bridge heights, which nearly forced the cancellation of the newly-restored Flying Scotsman locomotive’s triumphantto Scotland.Or incoming ScotRail Abellio asking staff to cut its predecessor First’s logo off their unorms. Or even First’s stewardship including shrinking the size of coffee cups on trains because it couldn’t cope with demand.Discontented workers and passengers don’t hold back on leaking me the bad news - like the latest ScotRail staff survey results, or its decision to scrap seat reservations. Then there’s the seemingly never ending woes of the new Caledonian Sleeper.By contrast, those responsible for promoting the railways need to up their game because far too often the “positive” news stories I write about rail are ones I have found myself.Perhaps Sir Eric might have recognised the predicament. In his inaugural presidential address to the institute in , he described the railways as the “great predominating factor in transport”.However, he said that despite their modest rate of , they “have figured in the minds of the masses as a great, bloated capitalist organisation, an object not of sympathy but rather of suspicion and jealousy”.A century on, I don’t have such prejudices, and I don’t go out looking for bad - or good - stories about the railways, or any other forms of transport, despite what some vocal conspiracy theorists claim on social media. I’m also not looking for ways to criticise - or praise - Sir Eric’s successors as transport ministers or the governments they serve.I’m just looking for interesting stories that our readers will find compelling, unexpected oruseful. I remain keen to hear from whistleblowers when things go wrong, but I’d equally like to receive new and interesting information from those who want to champion the railways.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"some working parents simply can t make things work that must change kelly ann woodland","story":"While there has been some progress in helping working parents, it can still be tough to juggle children and a career, writes STV News at Six presenter Kelly-Ann Woodland.Returning to work after a career break is tough going. Throw a teething baby and a brand new role into the works and it’s an emotional rollercoaster. A tiring, guilt-inducing, fraught, high-speed rollercoaster of a ride that never slows down. On the one hand, you get to go to the toilet by yourself at work. On the other, there’s a good chance you have a Cheerio in your hair. Many organisations are changing rapidly to ease ing to work and there are support groups out there to build confidence and help with the military-style planning that’s needed to balance work and family le. The opportunity to front flagship news programme The STV News at Six came when I was on maternity leave with my second son. I was six months in, with my head firmly focused on my kids. But this was my dream job and one I’d worked hard for. It would mean more hectic days, considerable planning, a y commute, a live show and a race home to put the kids to bed. So, was I right to go for the job I’d wanted all my le, despite the timing  Absolutely. For me, this was about making the right choices for the kids in the long-term and setting a good example. I wanted them to see you can go for the big jobs, irrespective of obstacles.: This is how maternity and paternity leaves around Europe compare: SNP unveils ‘game-changing’ plan for  weeks ‘Daddy leave’After clinching the job, I focused my efforts on trying to achieve that much-coveted work-le balance. I had a positive conversation with STV where we agreed new hours so that I could do the nursery and school run in the morning. I’d recommend going to employers with a reasonable but flexible plan and being open to a conversation about how you can both make it work – and thankfully, STV were receptive to this.As a family, we figured out a childcare plan, with my husband adapting his schedule and taking on afternoon pickups. I spend half my commute on the phone, organising the kid’s schedules. Loads of those calls are to my mum, who I’m very thankful to say is a godsend, especially when the kids are unwell.Exhausted before hitting motorwayLike loads of parents, there are mornings when I feel exhausted before I’ve even hit the motorway. And I’m not even going to get into the scrutiny of the appearance of women on screen, especially one who’s been woken up several times in the night before going live to half a million people each night. It simply shouldn’t matter.Alongside millions of other working parents, I’ve so many balls in the air and sometimes they come crashing down. I’ve still not managed to strike that perfect balance but a flexible working policy, an understanding boss, a support network and good childcare all help enormously. I’m trying to get into mindfulness, because self care is important too.There are many working parents with way greater demands on them, and many can’t make it work. There’s still so much more progress to be made. We need increased awareness that working parents can reconnect with their working self, they haven’t lost all their skills amidst a sea of babygros and sleep deprivation and should be encouraged to have a realistic conversation with employers about what works for them.If you see a job or promotion that you think is right for you, don’t be put off by the fact you’re on maternity leave. Be bold, be brave and seize the opportunity. When I showed this piece to my colleague – also a very tired working mum who, by the way, is killing it in the workplace – she asked me, ‘so are we winning’  Not just yet, but we’re getting there.Kelly-Ann Woodland is co-presenter of the STV News at Six©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh s west princes street gardens could be split in two under 25m open air events arena plan","story":"The scale of a new open-air events arena in Edinburgh city centre would see the historic West Princes Street Gardens effectively #split into two#it is allowed to go ahead, a heritage watchdog has warned.The Cockburn Association is warning the £ million Quaich Project to replace the existing Ross Bandstand will lead to the “overdevelopment” of the central section of the park.: Open-air cinema screenings beneath Edinburgh Castle and farmers markets suggested in £m revamped Princes Street Gardens plans It has raised concerns about the gardens being turned into a “building site” due to the level of work needed on a new performance complex, a grass-covered amphitheatre, and a two-storey visitor and hospitality centre.The Cockburn Association dates back to , the year before West Princes Street Gardens were transferred into public ownership. The first bandstand was created in  as part of a redesign by architect James Skene.The Ross Development Trust, which was set up by Apex Hotels founder Norman Springford to pursue an overhaul of the gardens, launched a consultation last month ahead of final plans being submitted in February. Blog PostBut in a blog post on its website, the Cockburn Association claims the gardens must be treated as “a public park where events are tolerated, not a performance area surrounded by gardens”. A new blog post on its website states: “We remain concerned that no detailed business plan outlining how the facility will be used and how often is available. “This is key as any intensication of use or further commercialisation of the gardens is unwelcome.”Cockburn Association director Terry Levinthal said: “The scale of the centrepiece – the pavilion, amphitheatre and Welcome Centre – will be read as a single entity as one approachesfrom west or east. Whilst it will be permeable in one sense – you can walk though it – visually it will read as a unied development spanning the gardens from the railway to Princes Street. “In effect, it will ide the gardens into two. Whilst the current bandstand undeniably presents a barrier, it is not on the same scale so has a lesser impact.”David Ellis, managing director of the Ross Development Trust, said: “Over the next two months we are working to incorporate feedback from the public consultation and will present the next stage of plans in late February.”Edinburgh World Heritage director Adam Wilkinson said: “It is essential that any intervention within the Waverley Valley respects its integrity and preserve its role as what Sir Walter Scott called the ‘great arena’ between the Old and New Towns.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

Wealth and power imbalances stop people with erse lived experiences from interacting, negotiating and working to understand each other, but more importantly to negotiate a common good that is equitable. “We should never forget that much of our own culture and infrastructure is a product of imperialism and dominance. Built on tobacco and cotton harvested by enslaved people, profits from people starved and forced off their land, or backbreaking heavy industries, Glasgow has the opportunity to create a new future.”The blueprint – which envisages Glasgow being “globally recognised as a leading creative and cultural world city” – highlights how it is now home to  dferent cultural organisations, including the national orchestra, theatre, opera, and ballet companies, and is also “blazing an internationally acclaimed trail in contemporary art, design and music”.However, it also states that although culture has been “central to Glasgow’s evolution for at least  years, the city should not be constrained by so much reverence for the past that the new can never become established”.A spokesman for Glasgow Le, which runs cultural venues for the council, said: “This new plan has been developed to build on all that the city has achieved and is a starting point for a renewed conversation led by Glasgow’s creative community.“We want to consolidate Glasgow’s position as a truly international arts capital – nurturing and showcasing the best in local and international creativity, design and music.“We would encourage anyone with a role in the sector to respond to the draft plan and have their say during the consultation period to help shape the final version.”David McDonald, deputy leader of the city council and chair of Glasgow Le, said: “Our new draft plan seeks to set out what the city can do to ensure that culture in Glasgow continues to flourish over the next  years.We know that participation in culture – whether it’s watching a play, creating your own piece of art or singing a song - is a force for good, and an enabler of community empowerment that can increase our quality of le. In Glasgow, we have a vibrant cultural sector that gives the city an edge. It inspires, questions and challenges us to see our city and the world in dferent ways.Having just been named as the UK’s top cultural city we need to now create the conditions in which our confident cultural sector can develop and grow, and where our artists are nurtured in their work.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party.

Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs .

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park.

He rejected any wrongdoing saying the holiday was taken in a personal capacity and was not paid for by the Malian government, but partly out of his own pocket and partly by a friend.He did not name the friend, but said that the friend was unconnected with his work and has received no benefit as a result of his work.Following a separate inquiry last year, Mr Paisley was suspended from the House of Commons for  days for “serious misconduct”.The watchdog ruled the then North Antrim Westminster candidate breached Commons rules on paid advocacy by writing to the PM to lobby against a UN resolution on Sri Lanka without disclosing family holidays paid for by their Government in .He later survived Parliament’s first ever recall petition.

The UUP demands it \"to demonstrate that we value and trust our young people of tomorrow\". Given only one in   to -year-olds voted UUP at the last Westminster contest, at least no one can accuse Steve Aikens party of naked self-interest.Of all parties elected to the most recent Westminster parliament, only the Conservatives and the DUP opposed lowering the voting age - and some Conservative MPs do support change. Scotland reduced the age of franchise for elections to its parliament and local councils in , having done so for the previous years independence referendum. Wales followed this year. Yet Northern Irelands devolved executive does not have the power - a rather important and curious anomaly that the parties favouring change do not mention in their respective manestos. There is no devolved Executive of course. As with much , Westminster or the Northern Ireland Office will have to decide.But is lowering the voting age a good idea  Whilst manestos are policy pledges not discussions, it would have been useful for the party manestos to tell us why.The UK led and the world followed in lowering the voting age from  to  half a century ago. Yet that change occurred amid consensus that the age of adulthood was . There is no agreement that -year-olds are adults. Votes for children may have scant appeal as a slogan. It might seem odd that young Scots could decide on the independence of their country in  but, as children needing health and safety protections, they could not buy alcohol, cigarettes or fireworks to celebrate or commiserate afterwards. Sixteen-year-olds could not drive to a friends house to discuss.Under the last Labour government - they used to happen, younger readers - I was appointed by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, to chair the Youth Citizenship Commission. Its tasks were to better connect young people to politics and examine whether the voting age should be lowered. Whether a middle-aged, politics-obsessed professor was really the person to solve youth disconnect is a moot point. I didnt, anyway. Only a minority of  to -year-olds voted at the general elections immediately prior to the commissions formation. And only a minority voted at the next three.In terms of  and -year-olds, they were evenly ided on whether the voting age should be lowered. The Electoral Commission had earlier found a clear majority of existing voters against the idea. So, we decided against recommending change. Given the advent of \"age-quake\", in which age is the most important iable in party choice in England, I dont think we did Labour many favours.Public opinion is showing signs of movement, however. Our recent survey for the Leverhulme Trust, conducted by Survation, found adult voters evenly ided on lowering the voting age and most  and -year-olds now in favour. Brexit may have made a dference.There are serious arguments for a reduction - just not the ones on tax, military service and marriage usually trotted out. Fewer people leave school at , get a job and pay income tax than ever before. You cannot see frontline service in the forces until  and no one gets married at  these days - you wouldnt get the parental permission you need anyway. Last year % of Northern Irelands marriages were of people aged  and over.Credible contentions for change lie where. Votes-at- would help balance an ageing society. The NI Statistics and Research Agency estimates that by  the population aged  and over will have increased by % - althoughNorthern Irelands health service crisis continues apace, that trend might be reversed. Arguments over capacity can favour change. A -year-old may have better critical faculties than a struggling -year-old - but there would understandably be outragethe latter was disenfranchised.So future elections could have dferent rules. With some polling stations located in schools and the new voters on site, maybe educational establishments could stay open. Would change be worthwhile  Only one in three  to -year-olds in Northern Ireland voted in the  Westminster election. If  and -year-olds are given the right, maybe it ought to be exercised  In the meantime, enjoy the show this Thursday.

I also taught myself some Christmas signs, just enough to help me hold a conversation with a child.\"The thought of seeing the look on their faces when Santa speaks to them in their own language spurred me on.\"Brian likes nothing more than giving children of all ages the best Christmas experience, and also decided to discard the fake beard.\"If anyone comes in and tries to lip read, they cant see my lips,\" he said. \"The fake beard also muffled words for the hard of hearing.

Nowhere , in England, Scotland or Wales, has this take place before. Northern Ireland was the first.This is a first that we never wanted and certainly a first that I, as a nurse, never expected to see.

This is why restoring pay parity with the rest of the UK is so important. Nurses pay here has fallen signicantly behind England and Wales, and further again behind Scotland. There is nothing to stop our highly-skilled nursing workforce leaving to work in other places where they will be paid more and, crucially, feel more valued. In particular, we cannot afford to lose our newly-qualied nurses at this stage of their career. These are the nurses of tomorrow that we need to nurture and encourage to stay.Last year, the health service in Northern Ireland spent £m on agency nurses to fill the gaps in the nursing workforce. We currently cannot do without these nurses.However far too much money is being spent in filling gaps rather than fixing the problem.We realise that these are complex problems and solutions will not be found overnight. However, we need to start somewhere. Nurses deliver the majority of direct patient care and are well aware of the problems in our health service.They are also well aware that there are not enough of them to deliver the care they would like to be giving.The RCNs recent employment survey revealed that around half of nurses in Northern Ireland are considering leaving nursing because of low staffing levels and almost three-quarters feel undervalued.This confirms everything that we have been talking about over the last number of months. Our message is clear and simple. We have been given a mandate from our members that enough really is enough, and we believe that the people of Northern Ireland agree with us.Pat Cullen is director of the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It was rejected by trade unions, who branded it as falling \"signicantly short\" of requirements.Kevin McAdam, from the Unite union, told BBC Radio Ulsters Evening Extra that the offer did not represent parity of pay with healthcare workers in England, Wales and Scotland.Mr McAdam said that the .% increase offered was not \"new money\" but that the funding had been \"on the table\" during negotiations from July.Unions, he added, are holding out for a .% increase.Asked what this increase would represent for workers, he said: \"This might be hundreds of pounds to iniduals.

bpanews_fafe--ab-be-eceaddb_EmailThe Prime Minister often talks about his Brexit deal being “oven-ready” – but could what he’s planning to cook up leave a bitter taste for those in Northern Ireland .pushJeremy Corbyn and Labour certainly think so, after publishing internal Treasury analysis about what the Withdrawal Agreement could mean in terms of checks on goods being traded into the six counties from Great Britain.Boris Johnson denies there is any truth in the report, that Mr Corbyn called “damning”.Here is a look at what has been said, both now and in the past, about the withdrawal deal’s impact on Northern Ireland.– What is this document Labour has got hold of As with many Whitehall documents, the boring name – NI Protocol: Unfettered Access To The UKIM– disguises the signicance of its -pages of contents.Brandishing the analysis at a central London press conference on Friday, Mr Corbyn said the documents were “cold hard evidence” that Mr Johnson had been “misrepresenting” his exit terms as good for the whole of the UK.The Labour leader said page five of the document stated: “There will be customs declarations and security checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.“For trade going the other way, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, there will be all of the above plus potentially damaging tarfs.”The possibility of customs declarations being required had been suggested previously by ministers – but for tarfs to be slapped on some goods was an entirely new proposition.If true, these new arrangements would have financial repercussions for businesses on both sides of the Irish Sea.– Is the Prime Minister conceding defeat on this Not at all – in fact, he has gone so far as to call the report’s contents “complete nonsense”, despite not having read it.“I haven’t seen the document you’re referring to, but that’s complete nonsense, and what I can tell you is that with the deal that we have, we can come out as one whole UK,” he told reporters on the campaign trail on Friday.– Has this always been Mr Johnson’s stance The Conservative leader has been firm on this throughout the election campaign.During a visit to Northern Ireland in November, at the very start of his UK election tour, he told businesses they could put customs declaration forms “in the bin” because there would be “no barriers of any kind” to trade crossing the Irish Sea.But Mr Johnson told the BBC in October, after agreeing his deal with the European Union, that there would be checks on some British goods in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland.“What we have agreed with the EU is that temporarily, and by consent of the people of Northern Ireland,there is stuff coming from GB into Ireland, or anywhere  in the world via Northern Ireland into Ireland then, yes, there can be checks,” he said.– And what about others in Government – do they think there could be checks Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, who was heavily involved in the negotiations, told MPs that customs “interventions” could be incoming after exit day.Speaking in the Commons in October, he said that “some information” and “minimal targeted interventions” would be required on goods travelling between the two parts of the UK, due to Northern Ireland remaining aligned with Dublin and Brussels’ trading rules for agricultural products and manufactured items.– So who is right on the customs and border issue Politics is rarely without “grey areas” and the mechanics of the Northern Ireland-Great Britain trading relationship after Brexit appears to be one of those areas.Page  of the Withdrawal Agreement notes that “nothing in this protocol prevents the United Kingdom from ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Ads for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingFrank McCoubreyGerry Carroll\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.The mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Mr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Mr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Mr Corbyn highlighted leaked Treasury documents released earlier in the day which he said showed Mr Johnsons withdrawal agreement meant there would be customs checks and restrictions on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Appearing before a live studio audience in Maidstone in a debate hosted by the BBC, the Prime Minister retorted that the claims were \"not true\". He added: \"I do find it slightly curious to say the least to be lectured about the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland by a man who all his political le has campaigned to break up that union and actually supported for four decades the IRA in their campaign violently to destroy it.\" Mr Corbyn in turn challenged Mr Johnson to show a \"degree of honesty\" about the arrangements he had made for Northern Ireland. He said: \"He spoke at the DUP conference and said there would be no restrictions whatsoever. We now know there are restrictions. He could and should have said that at the time.\" Mr Johnson questioned how Labour could negotiate a new Brexit deal as it has pledged to do when Mr Corbyn was \"neutral\" and other frontbenchers were pro-Remain. \"Who is going to negotiate it because as far as I can see everybody on the Labour frontbench is campaigning to Remain apart from Mr Corbyn who is neutral on the matter \" he said \"How can you get a deal, a new deal from Brussels for Brexit,you dont actually believe in it  \"Thats the mystery that I fail to understand.\" Mr Johnson also brushed off an intervention by former prime minister Sir John Major who suggested he would back former Tory MPs now standing as independents after having the whip withdrawn. \"Unlike Mr Major, I lead a party that is now totally united,\" he said.Mr Johnson was also confronted with remarks from the father of a man killed in the London Bridge terror attack, as Mr Corbyn tackled the PM on the impact of austerity on policing.Dave Merritt, whose son Jack was one of two people killed by convicted terrorist Usman Khan, condemned Mr Johnson earlier this week for using the attack as justication for a series of tougher criminal policies.Challenged on the remarks, the PM said he had \"huge sympathy\" for Mr Merritt and the relatives of the families of both victims. \"It was a terrible thing,\" he added.\"But I still think it is wrong that Usman Khan, who was sentenced to  years… should have been out automatically on eight years.\"Mr Corbyn commented: \"What happened on the streets of London was utterly appalling.\"Viewers of the debate believe that Mr Johnson narrowly won, although it was within the polling margin of error so is effectively too close to call. According to a YouGov snap poll % believe Mr Johnson won and % think Mr Corbyn did. The pollster said this falls within the margin of error so it can be considered another draw.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The event at Littlehands SureStart in Rosemount was to promote the importance of registered childminders For the last  years NICMA has been delivering support services for Registered Childminders who provide , day care places for children across Northern Ireland. Teresa McKeever, a Registered Childminder from Derry, said she gets great satisfactionfrom what she does. “I love childminding. I’ve been doing the job for less than a year, although I have been involved in the childcare sector for over  years. Every day I have a real sense of job satisfaction. You can really see children grow, develop and learn. Childminding plays a transformative role in children’s lives. The training, checks and visits are critical to keep the children safe and it’s only what you would expect,you were leaving your child with someone to ensure peace of mind. googletag.cmd.push “As a Registered Childminder, I am professional in my approach and I am committed to continuous personal development and training. I would encourage others to consider childminding as a career. It is so rewarding and the flexibility it offers means you can choose how many hours you wish to work every week.” Patricia Lewsley-Mooney CBE, NICMA CEO, commented: “The Festive Bake Off is just one part of a wider programme of activity which has been organised to encourage parents to consider the many benefits that come with using a Registered Childminder to care for their children. At the event, children will be baking healthy treats and doing some Christmas crafting. These are the type of creative activities Registered Childminders do on a daily basis with the children in their care. googletag.cmd.push “It is important that parents think about their choice of childminder. We know that parents ultimately want to keep their children safe, and some parents will feel that they have a choice to make between using a Registered Childminder or an unregistered childminder. However, quite simply there is no choice. The law is very clear, anybody looking after children for more than two hours a day, for reward, must register with the Health and Social Care Trust. Registered Childminders will have completed Access NI Checks on all iniduals in the household over the age of  and will have Public Liability insurance cover. “A Registered Childminder will also be required to update mandatory training every threeyears. They will be registered by the Trust and inspected on an annual basis by Early Years Social Workers. These checks help to keep your child safe, so you really should carefully consider who is looking after your child. In addition, NICMA provide advice and work in partnership with other organisations such as Family Support NI and the Western Childcare Partnership , who detail local services and information to support you and your family.” Throughout this year and next the Western Childcare Partnershipwill be supporting the awareness campaign to which it is hoped will also promote childcare as a career option to address the decreasing number of childcare places within the area and also to challenge unregistered childcare within the WCP locality.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held. For the first time in the history of the society one judge travelled from England to adjudicate.SHRIGLEY mdash A quantity of leather coats valued at pound, were stolen when the offices of the Ulster Leather Company at Shrigley were broken into. The thieves gained entry by smashing a window and made off with  coats.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar War Memorial Hall was packed to capacity for a concert organised by Wellington Memorial Silver Band.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

But the DUP gave no hint it will row back on its pledge not to back the as an alternative prime minister Jeremy Corbyn in a hung parliamentTrade experts, business groups, some of Mr Johnson’s ministers and his own government’s document explaining his deal make clear that it will involve additional burdens on goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and vice versa.But yesterday Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn revealed a leaked Treasury analysis of his proposed deal – which he attempted to rush through the Commons with minimal scrutiny before calling the election..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Johnson has made clear that he will attempt to get MPs to pass his “oven ready” deal soon after the election.Yesterday Mr Corbyn, whose manesto rules out even a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, said that the confidential document “drives a coach and horses” through Mr Johnson’s claims and further exposes the prime minister for “deliberately misleading” the public.The Labour leader brandished the dossier marked “official – sensitive” at a press conference on Friday, saying it is “cold, hard evidence” from the Treasury that the PM’s Brexit deal would damage the nation.The report sets out the belief that there will be customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit, something Mr Johnson has claimed would not happen.The Tories said the documents did not back up Mr Corbyn’s “wild conspiracy theories” but did not specically rule out the presence of a customs border in the Irish Sea under their deal.Mr Corbyn said: “We have now caught Johnson red-handed misrepresenting his own Brexit deal.”The document, Mr Corbyn added, “drives a coach and horses through the prime minister’s claim that there will be, in his words, no border in the Irish Sea”.Mr Corbyn highlighted page five of the document, which lists customs and security checks on exports from Northern Ireland to Great Britain as “potential fetters” to trade.For goods travelling in the other direction, the document says tarfs, customs declarations on imports, checks on safety, security and regulations are possible issues., Jamie Wildman , Rev David Walsh , Jim Hakewill , Clare Pavitt , Chris Nelson \"  , Jamie Wildman , Rev David Walsh , Jim Hakewill , Clare Pavitt , Chris Nelson \"  Ketterings parliamentary candidates vie for your vote at local hustings Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The PM suggested last month that Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was wrong to say goods would face checks under his deal and Mr Johnson has been backed up by Julian Smith. Tory Party chair James Cleverly said: “The Conservatives have negotiated a great new deal with the EU which takes the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, out of the EU.”Mr Corbyn was joined on the stage by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who said: “The issue of whether there are going to be checks is absolutely blown out of the water by this document, as is the suggestion that it won’t be bad for business.”The Liberal Democrats welcomed the documents as evidence the PM “has been caught lying to the British public once again”.TUV leader Jim Allister met secretary of state yesterday and said that in a “straight-talking meeting” he had “left Mr Smith in no doubt about the feeling of betrayal within Unionism and the united opposition across our community to the Boris deal which produces Brexit for Great Britain but not for Northern Ireland”.• Yesterday the DUP expressed concern at the implications of Boris Johnson’s deal.However, the party gave no hint that it will row back on its firm pledge not to back the man who most likely will be the only alternative prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn, in the event of a hung parliament.Lagan Valley candidate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, pictured, said the leaked document was “further demonstration that the prime minister’s deal would be bad for Northern Ireland”. The DUP chief whip said: “The DUP warned the prime minister about this. Despite his protestations, the facts are in black and white. That is why we opposed the deal in the House of Commons and why Northern Ireland needs the deal changed.”Sir Jeffrey added: “Jeremy Corbyn is using this as a campaigning tool but no unionist will be tricked by his rhetoric. He has in the past and would in the future work in cahoots with those who want to destroy the Union.”UUP leader Steve Aiken said: “Arlene Foster and her colleagues bear a heavy responsibility for this crisis and they cannot continue in denial any longer. The public deserve to know which DUP MPs were involved in negotiations with the government in the run up to Johnson’s deal and what they agreed  They should also reveal what additional financial package they were offered infor their support for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea.“Northern Ireland faces a serious threat to its position within the United Kingdom. The DUP cannot hide or minimise the role they played in getting us here.”try catch  TrendingInappropriate content, staff members personal information and threatening messages - NI schools contact PSNI over a fake Snapchat accountsNI snow alert -

There are many of us and we all intend to vote.We note with regret the manner in which so-called ‘legacy issues’ have been handled to date and we now call upon all inidual candidates and all political parties to state without equivocation their stance on the issue of the draft legislation arising from the Stormont House Agreement , pictured..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In particular we call upon all parties to express their clear opposition to the proposed creation of a ‘Historical Investigations Unit’ . We believe this proposal will:• create  expectations of long-delayed justice for victims of crime• create new victims and re-victimise existing ones in relation to trauma• undermine centuries of successful development of the rule of law by introducing arbitrary and capricious official opinions as a substitute for due process and judicial decisions• breach numerous articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and• facilitate a huge and expensive exercise in scapegoating those who worked to protect society whilst ignoring the perpetrators of violence.We will not countenance the perpetuation of what we see as a witch hunt – a witch hunt which is clearly designed to assist those who seek to re-write the history of the last  years in order to deflect attention from their heinous crimes, to justy terrorism and to blame others for the ensuing misery.We welcome the references in the manestos of two of our main political parties to their concerns about the HIU. We now call upon all parties to repudiate the concept of any quasi-judicial definition of ‘collusion’. The law already provides for the investigation and punishment of conspiracy to murder, perverting the course of justice and all other associated crimes.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important.
