You were putting an appeal in to get her prosecuted, you never bothered to see her.\u0027If it had been... an ordinary person, you wouldn\u0027t have prosecuted.\u0027I see domestic abuse and I just think you should be disgusted with yourself so there is nothing we can do to bring Caroline back. I hope in hindsight you do regret this. This girl killed herself because you put an appeal through.\u0027Earlier in the hearing DI Batemen had insisted she had not treated the presenter any differently because she was famous and would not change her decisions.She said a caution was not appropriate because Flack did not admit her guilt in a police interview, although she had said \u0027I hit him, he was cheating on me\u0027 at the scene.Mr Daw, the author of Justice on Trial, said she should have been given the chance to agree to the lesser police action.He said: \u0027What should have happened here is that she should have been offered a caution, in the cold light of day I strongly expect from experience, had she been offered one her lawyers would have advised her to accept it and in all probability she would have done.\u0027The CPS came to the view that a caution was appropriate, yet the police were adamant for reasons I don\u0027t understand that there had to be a criminal prosecution.\u0027It seems to me that the system failed on a number of levels. It failed because there appears to have been undue influence by two factors, her high profile and therefore there\u0027s a desire not be seen to be going soft on someone who is in the public eye and risking adverse public comment – that was a factor undoubtedly in this case.\u0027This is not a case where there was evidence where the victim was under coercion or so vulnerable he was incapable of making a decision on what was best for him – and there are such cases, where the victim wants to withdraw the complaint through fear.\u0027We have had victims of domestic violence committing suicide because they are forced into the court system.\u0027Here we have a decision in principle by the CPS prosecution was not in the public interest and having made that decision they are persuaded to change that assessment by the police even though it\u0027s nothing to do with the police. The police have no role in the public interest, it\u0027s not their job, their job is to investigate and present the file to the CPS – it is not to decide what is in the public interest.\u0027My major concern here is that the CPS\u0027s decision, which is so fundamental in the system about public interest, was overridden by the police – that shouldn\u0027t happen. I don\u0027t accept that is a legitimate exchange of views between the CPS and the police.\u0027  A CPS spokesperson said it stood by its decision and said Flack\u0027s fame had no bearing on it.They added: \u0027A suspect\u0027s celebrity status is not a factor in our decisions to prosecute.\u0027Our handling of this case was carefully reviewed throughout and our guidance and legal tests were followed.We are satisfied that the prosecution was correctly brought. \u0027The issue of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health was addressed on a number of occasions throughout the legal process. Our decisions were made on the basis of the medical opinion available to us each time.\u0027As the inquest heard there was clearly a more significant history of issues and a further deterioration of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health of which we had not been made aware.\u0027 Justice on Trial: Radical Solutions for a System at Breaking Point: Chris Daw: Bloomsbury Continuum"},{"url":null,"title":"Obese people told stay home Covid hotspots virus cases surge amid second wave","story":"Share this articleObese people in Coronavirus hotspots will be told to stay indoors to combat second wave"},{"url":null,"title":"Madeleine McCann prime suspect Christian Brueckner NEVER face trial lawyers insist","story":"Share this articleMadeleine McCann prime suspect Christian B will NEVER face trial for her disappearance, his lawyer claims"},{"url":null,"title":"Teachers union tries sabotage school reopening plan impossible list 200 safety demands","story":"Share this article She said: \u0027I think it needs to be as regular as it needs to be for the infection to be caught... certainly not one-offs but regular occurrences so they\u0027re part and parcel of the running of a school.\u0027But this was slapped down by schools minister Nick Gibb, who said only those who developed symptoms would be tested.The minister this morning told Times Radio: \u0027Anybody who shows symptoms in schools will be tested, it won\u0027t be routine testing... the advice we have is it\u0027s better when people show symptoms.If they test positive the people that pupil has been in contact with will be self-isolating...

She also said teachers and older children should be able to wear masks \u0027if it makes them feel more reassured\u0027.It came after teaching unions urged Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to allow staff to use masks if they choose.Department for Education guidance states that face coverings are not needed where pupils and staff mix in consistent \u0027bubbles\u0027.Asked whether teachers should be allowed to wear masks if they wish to, Mr Gibb noted that the scientific advice was that there was no reason for staff or pupils to wear face coverings in school. But he added: \u0027These kind of issues will be up to the head teachers.\u0027But there is no need for mask-wearing within the school, provided that the hierarchy of controls... are in place.\u0027On testing, he said: \u0027Anybody that shows symptoms in schools – teachers and pupils – will be prioritised.\u0027Not routine testing. The advice we have is that it\u0027s better to test when people actually show symptoms.\u0027It came as Professor Russell Viner, a member of the government advisory group Sage, said that one of the biggest studies into the risk of coronavirus spreading in schools will soon confirm there is \u0027very little evidence\u0027 that it is transmitted there.The research by Public Health England looked at 20,000 pupils and teachers in 100 schools across England who were tested to monitor the spread of the disease up to the end of the summer term.It will be published later in the year."},{"url":null,"title":"How high school football player WRONGLY convicted molesting four year old boy","story":"Share this articleWhy \u0027Outcry¿s Gaebri Anderson stuck by boyfriend Greg Kelley"},{"url":null,"title":"Nearly 100 000 children test positive coronavirus past two weeks","story":"Share this article97,000 children reportedly test positive for COVID-19 as schools gear up for instruction - CBS NewsNo parties, no trips: Colleges set COVID-19 rules for fall - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37fbc0fbcb343170db3333d5cd64d0440f706eee/0_131_4252_2553/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=379f8144bf2ae6d1e13ba465fde43a9c","title":"sketches from a trying year 10 cartoonists reflect on 2020","story":"Leading cartoonists share exclusive artwork to help us get through the pandemic – and other disasters – with humourStaff cartoonist with the Times Literary Supplement. Lives in LondonI was thinking of how the coronavirus has reshaped and reconfigured so many different aspects of our lives. And I wanted the cartoon to be a bit positive. The virus has made a hole in the fabric of our world, but things are starting to come back. People are going to fly a bit less and hopefully care about the environment a bit more.I was ill with Covid-19 in March and April for about three weeks (I’m better now). I had a deadline to meet while in isolation and I’d wake up, draw and go back to sleep again. I stayed in my little room for 15 days. In that time, it was really beautiful to have work to do, otherwise I’d have been bouncing off the walls. I was most happy when I was drawing.In the beginning of the pandemic, I was feeling fairly useless: why wasn’t I doing something useful like working as a nurse? But my drawings about Covid-19 have got the most response I’ve ever had and that has felt really good. Some of the work has been resonating with people, helping them to reconfigure and understand their experiences. It turns out that actually we do have a function.Favourite cartoonist of all time?Gerald Scarfe, because of the energy and scratchiness, things I sometimes feel are lacking from my work. I just think he’s amazing.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?Making people look at ordinary, innocuous things in a new way.Has been drawing for Private Eye since 1979, also the Spectator, the Oldie and the Church Times. Lives in DorsetI was thinking about the R rate and playing around with words and this took shape. Ideas for cartoons often come to me through wordplay. I read English at university, whereas drawing was just a hobby, but it was the drawing that took off.There’s a lot of outlet at the moment for black humour, though the editor of Private Eye started appealing for cartoons that were nothing to do with the pandemic because it was all that was on anyone’s mind. With coronavirus, I try to keep it reasonably light-hearted – things that I hope will make people smile, rather than groan in dismay.I’m not an avid devourer of news, particularly at the moment because it’s all been so depressing, though obviously I do keep up with it – I’ve been saying “Arrgh” to myself quite a lot recently.Favourite cartoonist of all time?Ronald Searle. I love his characters, the expressions he captures. He did a series called Revolting Cats, and there was one he did of a particularly revolting cat startled by a gesture of affection and I loved the frozen expression and attitude of the cat, it was just wonderful.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?Like most Private Eye cartoonists, it has to be politics and politicians saying silly things – that’s an endless source of cartoons.Political cartoonist for the Observer. Lives in NorfolkBritannia and the lion are two characters I’ve been using quite a bit during the past few months, to express a national mood. That’s a little Huawei phone lying on the ground, dropped as if it’s a hot potato. I was just thinking, of all the times to be caught between the two great economic blocs in the world, the US and China, we are in the process of leaving the third. It beggars belief.The only good thing you can say about 2020, for people who draw political cartoons for a living, is that it’s been a really productive year so far. We’re never without a contentious topic. Often what one is doing is polemical or satirical, but there’s also a fellow feeling, and during the pandemic I’ve been drawn to more empathic images – people in lockdown looking out of tower block windows, or figures coming together in unity. I’ve been trying to do something that says, “We all feel this, don’t we?” as opposed to, “Look at that person, aren’t they terrible.” In the current political climate, there’s an enormous range, from the quiet heroism of NHS workers to government advisers who decide to test their eyesight, that one can use as subject matter.Favourite cartoonist of all time?Daumier, the French cartoonist of the mid-19th century. His drawing style is so amazing and he was a master caricaturist. He was also working at an incredibly interesting, febrile time, through all sorts of political censorship, riots and absolutism, and republicanism bubbling up, yet he did work with wonderful, graceful style.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?Brexit. Isn’t that an odd thing to say? And yet, it makes me cross all the time and then I can draw feeling cross about it. I wish we could rewind the clock, but in the absence of that, it’s incumbent on us to say continually there’s a better way.Private Eye, New Statesman, Spectator, Prospect. Lives in HoveI have a cartoon notebook and I just fill it with loads of doodles and ideas – I draw them rather than write them down. Then I go through them all at the end of the day, making slight changes, and if I think something might work as a joke, like this one, I draw it up.Work has been very busy of late and there’s a constant supply of subject matter. What I’ve found is that, at the end of the day, I just cannot read or watch any more news. In the past I would cook with the news on, but now I’ve just been watching Location, Location, Location.It’s a bit like Brexit where at first there was a nonstop supply of jokes and creativity. The financial crash, too, was hugely profitable for cartoonists, though I say that in inverted commas, because nothing cartoonists do is profitable. But there was a constant stream of jokes, and you didn’t have to hunt around on a slow-news day. It’s the same with the pandemic: everyone knows what you’re talking about because everyone knows the subject matter. And it just has so many different angles.Favourite cartoonist of all time?David Sipress, an American cartoonist who does stuff for the New Yorker, is close to a genius. I really like his cartoon style – it looks like he can’t draw. He captures life as a poor, forsaken human being.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?The effect on the forlorn, everyday person of events beyond their control.The cartoons of Jon Link and Mick Bunnage have featured in the , New Scientist, Esquire and elsewhere. Link lives in Brighton, Bunnage in LondonThis is the longest time the pubs have been shut in living history. With this cartoon we wanted to reaffirm the UK people’s right to responsibly watch a pub fight while eating a packet of crisps, whatever else might be going on in the real world.Since we started working together, we’ve always worked on the phone, just in case something like the lockdown happened, so in many ways we were fully prepped when it did. As cartoonists, we just deal with whatever’s put in front of us, so if the next thing is a nuclear war or something, as long as we can gaffer-tape a pencil on to an arm stump we’ll have a go at getting some jokes out of it.We see making cartoons as being like watching a load of stuff go by on a conveyor belt, then trying to remember what you’ve seen. You have to draw selected chunks of it as it happens or you forget. People find it reassuring that there’s someone out there sieving through the bin bags on their behalf, then crafting it into something they might want to laugh at, depending on whether or not they think it’s funny.During lockdown, Jon’s been building benches out of pallets he found in the street and Mick hasn’t been out of his house for four months. Neither of which has had much impact on our work.Favourite cartoonist of all time?Steinberg, Mordillo, Heath, Nick Newman, Viz, Kevin Woodcock, Thurber.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?We tried to boil down the essence of a good cartoon once and discovered the perfect set-up is an authority figure sat behind a desk being told to fuck off by a man wearing a hat.Has published cartoons in Private Eye since 1990. Lives in LondonWhen this whole thing ends, we’re going to find that people have had very different experiences of 2020, so it makes it difficult to say anything about it. For a lot of people it’s been a sort of non-year, for others it’s been very traumatic. But most people can agree that it’s been a big pile of poo. This joke sums it up quite quickly, whereas really it’s very, very complicated. Most of us don’t really understand what’s happening even the experts don’t really know.Obviously you don’t want to be glib – people have lost family members – but at the same time, a lot of it is slightly ludicrous, with very strange mixed messages coming out. People are being encouraged to get back on aeroplanes, but now you’ve got to go into quarantine, you dirty scum.We were all raised to think the apocalypse was going to be more dramatic than this. Is this the end of humanity then? It does just seem like it’s the end of decent things on telly. If this were a box set, I’d have moved on to the next one by now.Favourite cartoonist of all time?I like Albert Uderzo, who drew the Asterix books. He was the first proper cartoonist I liked, and if you look at my cartoons, you’ll see his influence in the big noses.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?I studied politics and economics at university, so a lot of my cartoons are inspired by the fact that people I was at university with are now in positions of authority. Some American humourist said the true definition of hell is to wake up to find your high-school class running the country. That’s the position I’m at now in my middle age.Regularly published by the , New Statesman and the BBC. Lives in LondonI always worry when making art about a hugely important issue like Black Lives Matter that I’m not going to do it justice. It’s such a massive movement, manifesting in so many ways globally. The American movement strikes a particular chord with me. I’m originally from St Louis, Missouri, where Black Lives Matter started. The racism within policing there was obvious for anyone to see, and that racism was reflected in St Louis at large. On top of racism, the authority given to police and normalised by society in America is a big problem.There are some wonderful American political cartoonists, but if I had to choose, my preference lies with British political cartoons, which I think are, collectively, wittier and a bit more distinct from one another than are their American counterparts.I’m not sure how I come up with ideas. I follow the news like the horrifying soap opera it is, and see where that takes me. I’ll be wandering the flat having imagined conversations in my head and think, huh, that bit was sort of funny. I basically tell myself jokes constantly. That’s the whole process.Favourite political cartoonist of all time?Ralph Steadman. Everything he does is beautiful and also sick and weird.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?Anything that feels like it actually matters, rather than something that is just theatre.Has drawn for Radio Times, Private Eye, the Observer and the Sunday Times. Lives in SomersetI’ve used that fish-in-a-bowl theme quite a bit in the past. It’s a go-to starting point if I’m scratching my head, and it kind of works with the lockdown – it’s quite a good image for how I and most freelancers work, we’re in our own little bubble. The fish is me, and probably a lot of people, though we’ve all had completely different experiences of the pandemic. People say we’re all in the same boat, but we’re not really. We’re all in the same storm and some people have nice boats and some people are clinging to little rafts. But there is a collective consciousness in that everyone’s plugged into this terrible event. Which is what cartoonists do: we observe and we plug into this consciousness and then we take our own angle on it and hopefully cheer people up. That’s the aim.Favourite cartoonist of all time?I couldn’t say. There are so many people who are good, it’s actually quite depressing. You see young people coming up, and people who have been around for a while still doing amazing things, and you just think, oh dear, it’s quite intimidating actually.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?What’s really strange is, sometimes the blandest things that you’re asked to tackle, like accountancy, can become the most interesting and yield really creative ideas. Though I do like politics: it’s nice if you can land a shot on somebody who you particularly dislike, or who’s done something that you disagree with.Has drawn for Private Eye, the  and the Times. Lives in LondonI know people who are going bonkers because they’re working on their own at home. They’ve been sat watching daytime television and drinking too much, and not really using the lockdown fruitfully or wisely. I’ve always been used to working from home – I think most freelancers are, and certainly most cartoonists, so they’ve probably not noticed any difference, other than that the pubs have been shut.Bad times are generally good for cartoonists, because more people tend to buy newsprint when things are bad, but this is different because papers are suffering due to lack of advertising, so they cut back, and the first people they cut back on are cartoonists.Favourite cartoonist of all time?Sempé, the French cartoonist. His cartoons are purely visual and beautifully drawn, and they’re great ideas. He’s a social cartoonist, and the social cartoon really has been obliterated, which is a shame. They’re wonderful things.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?Anything that annoys me. At the moment, it’s the restrictions in restaurants and pubs. It’s not fun going to a pub any more because of them. And people having a nervous breakdown because you’ve come within six feet of them. Social distancing is really getting up my nose at the moment.Has drawn for Private Eye and the Literary Review. Lives in DevonThis cartoon is really different from my usual stuff. I don’t do observational or current affairs or satirical cartoons or anything like that. My cartoons are almost exclusively bits of wordplay or surreal puns. My process is normally just: things pop into my head. I wait for the ideas to come to me. It’s a passive system. So the events of 2020 aren’t really affecting my work that much. I did one cartoon in the early days of the lockdown where a murmuration was just one bird on its own, in social isolation, but that’s quite unusual. Mostly I’m in my own little world and that’s where my ideas come from.This cartoon is slightly disingenuous because that’s not really my life. I’m not a full-time cartoonist – I do various other things including book illustration. But I do work from home and I am quite used to the routines of a lockdown life. Sitting there staring out of the window looking for inspiration is what I do quite a lot of the time.Favourite cartoonist of all time?Gary Larson. He’s someone whose work I grew up with – my dad and I loved looking at his books together – so he has a sentimental place in my heart. He’s not necessarily always the best, but he’s very funny.Topic or subject matter that inspires you most?My cartoons quite often feature animals – there are a lot of ducks. It’s the Larson thing of using animals as a way of looking at the traits of humans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100085941f6850f256b3292185f94328abb9969f/0_333_3984_2390/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e2581daa603e66f6e95ef73e5e15689","title":"the big picture on the road with los angeles alternative schoolie movement","story":"Photographer Dotan Saguy captures an American family’s existence in a former school busMore than 16,000 people in Los Angeles live in cars, vans and buses. Some are part of the “schoolie” movement, families who have bought an old school bus and converted it into a mobile home.Photographer Dotan Saguy met Ismael and Greice Reis and their three children on the first day they arrived in the city in 2019 in their yellow school bus. Ismael and Greice were Mormons, originally from Brazil. The kids were aged two, five and 10. Saguy spent most of the year photographing the family as they tried to survive in LA in their bus. His book Nowhere to Go But Everywhere documents their progress.They had been travelling by then for six months after Ismael had given up his job as a waiter in Delaware. They had set out with a tank full of gas and $400. Casual work had proved hard to find. Their worst stories always began “Our bus broke down”. Once, in Pennsylvania, in the absence of alternatives, Ismael was forced to sit outside a Walmart with a cardboard sign reading: “Hungry, travelling with family, auto problems, please help.” He raised $200 in an hour.Though the family set out with the idea of being missionaries, they had come to doubt their faith. A different kind of philosophy had taken over, one they learned from watching The Lion King: “hakuna matata”, no worries, live for the moment. “I’m totally devoted to it,” Ismael said. “I’m not thinking about how I’m going to pay my bills next month or whether I’m running out of milk. It’s almost like you’re Tarzan swinging on a vine: in order to continue moving, you need to let go and trust the next vine will be there to carry you forward.

To cut obesity people need support and jobsBoris Johnson has made obesity a political issue. The prime minister accepts that one of the reasons he nearly died from Covid-19 was that he was carrying too many pounds.Johnson is not the first prime minister to “declare war” on obesity. In recent decades there have been plenty of campaigns designed to make people exercise more and eat more healthily. There have been exhortations to eat five a day, sugar taxes, bans on the advertising of junk food, but none of them have made a difference. Obesity levels in England have doubled in the past quarter of a century.In theory, Johnson ought to have a greater chance of succeeding, because his initiative has been launched during a global pandemic when the potential dangers are glaringly apparent. A report from Public Health England in June found that being obese or excessively overweight increased the chances of death or serious illness from Covid-19. Hospitals have been treating plenty of people in a similar condition to the prime minister’s.Johnson is overweight but doesn’t have to count the pennies. It is far more common for people who are obese – in developed countries, at least – to be poor. Obesity is an economic issue, as a recent academic study published by the magazine Nature shows.The paper, by Alexander Bentley, Paul Ormerod and Damian Ruck, looks at how obesity evolved in the US between 1990 and 2015. It is a pretty dense, academic tract but worth a read because the findings are significant.This is a developed-country phenomenon. In the developing world, calorific intake and obesity levels tend to be higher among the better off. It is also a recent phenomenon. Industrially processed foods, with their high sugar and fat content, have been available for more than a century but it is only in the past three decades that the link between income and obesity has become so marked.The paper explores a number of reasons for the trend. One is that poor people have plenty of other things that worry them more than being overweight. A second is that many low-income families live in food deserts and have to travel relatively long distances, often on foot, to shops that sell nutritious food. More than 50 million people in the US – getting on for a fifth of the population – live in low-income districts where there is no convenient access to a supermarket.All of which suggests that an anti-obesity strategy based around trying to ensure children don’t view junk food ads, exhorting the overweight to take up jogging and advising that it would be a good idea to ditch the fizzy drink for a glass of carrot juice is bound to fail. That approach often comes across as downright condescending and misses the point. If obesity is linked to poverty – which is what the evidence suggests – then the way to reduce obesity is to reduce poverty.Unfortunately, the economic shock imparted by Covid-19 looks likely to push more people below the poverty line. That’s because the most vulnerable sectors – hospitality, retailing and leisure – are those that employ low-income workers and offer entry-level jobs for those who are not working.If governments are serious about tackling obesity, they need to ensure special attention is paid to low-income families. They need to use the tax system so that employers have the incentive to hire rather than fire they should be more generous with tax credits to top up the incomes of the working poor and they should resist pressure to reduce budget deficits by cutting benefits. The message for the politicians is clear. There will be less obesity when people can afford to eat better – and more expensive – food. To do that they need to be better off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac34f4cb835b2d598cd969658f28be2f4eec31d5/0_494_4827_2897/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e87e93c19213c64a23b6fd7cac22fa98","title":"mistakes identities dismayed readers change","story":"When a picture of Kano was used in place of Wiley, readers asked to know how it happened – and how it can be preventedAt 6am on Wednesday 29 July, an opinion piece by Owen Jones was published on the ’s website. In Tackling racism on social media is just the tip of the iceberg, the writer set out his stall with reference to the grime artist Wiley, whose recent antisemitic posts would eventually lead to him being banned from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.The article’s main image purported to show Wiley but, as readers would soon point out, was in fact of fellow grime pioneer, songwriter and actor Kano. The picture was changed immediately after the newsdesk was alerted at about 7.45am. The paper’s head of opinion, Jonathan Shainin, followed up by apologising privately to Kano and later that day the  publicly issued an unreserved apology.Kano was, unsurprisingly, deeply upset by the incident.  had confused two black British artists and in the context of Wiley’s repugnant comments. Although all surrounding text made clear that Wiley was the subject, it was a bad error. To compound matters, it was not the first time that Kano’s representatives had cause to complain the BBC News channel and Variety online had made the same mistake with the picture over the previous weekend.Having looked into the matter, I believe it was in fact an honest mistake profoundly regretted. However, the best intentions are no guarantor of outcome, and readers rightly ask to know how the fault occurred and how a recurrence will be prevented.Jones had filed his column at 1.30pm on Tuesday. Three staff were then involved in preparing the piece before the finished version – including headline, caption and a photo – was sent back to an editor for approval about 6.30pm (writers are rarely, if ever, involved once their words are submitted). However, shortly after the piece was signed off, it was suggested that a picture of Wiley would be a better illustration than the one already chosen.A production journalist searched for a replacement image within the ’s picture library, which receives upwards of 30,000 photos a day from staff, contributors and agencies, using the term “Wiley”. Of the first eight images returned, with the most recent at the top, six were of Wiley, one of Emma Barnett, who had condemned the rapper’s comments on her BBC Radio 5 live show, and the eighth was of Kano, taken in 2017 but uploaded on 23 July 2020 following his nomination for this year’s Mercury prize.The description provided by PA, the agency that sent the photo, accurately stated this was Kano, but a secondary mention of Wiley – a featured guest on Kano’s 2016 Mercury-nominated album – had caused it to appear in the top search results. Kano was seen in profile, wearing a cap and with a microphone held close to his face. The misty stage setting looked of a piece with the concert photo of Wiley that sat alongside, creating an illusion of similarity that had already caught out two media organisations and prompted PA, alerted by Kano’s team, to issue a warning email to clients, which, due to technical error, was not sent to the .Careful reading of the agency description, displayed when a photo is selected, would have set a misapprehending journalist straight. Iniduals working on opinion and news pieces possess sound knowledge of core current affairs but are not specialist in every topic – social, political, scientific or cultural – that crosses their desk. The abiding instinct to doubt and check is therefore vital.So is an extra pair of eyes. In this case the production journalist was now working alone from home, swapping out the photo as a last task before finishing for the day. The story was scheduled to publish next morning. No one saw the page again until readers did.This was the second time in a week that the  had used a picture of the wrong person of BAME background. Two days earlier an article about the death of Denise Johnson of Primal Scream had for the first 60 minutes carried a photograph of another black singer. And a day after the KanoWiley mix-up, one of the pictures in a live football blog claimed to show Brentford’s Julian Jeanvier challenging a Swansea player, although Jeanvier never left the subs’ bench. In both cases, fault was assisted by incorrect information supplied by Getty Images, who have apologised for any offence, issued corrections and pledged to improve their captioning processes.Most major media organisations rely on trusted agencies, who are contracted to provide news and pictures, but responsibility for accuracy rests ultimately with the publisher.Since the start of this year, my office has been aware of 17 instances in which a person has been misidentified by the  globally (there may be more that do not reach me). In February, Scotland rugby player Huw Jones was mistaken for teammate Sean Maitland, while a still from the romcom Crazy Rich Asians misidentified actor Sonoya Mizuno as Constance Wu. In March, an obituary of Jack Welch, chairman and chief executive of General Electric, briefly carried a photo of the company’s former vice-chairman, Bob Wright. And in April the national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, was captioned as Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser. Six of the 17 involved BAME iniduals. We will keep monitoring this.Mistakes inevitably occur in a fast-paced news environment but mistakes with people’s identities are disrespectful in any circumstance, and hurtful in some. The reflection that has followed these latest incidents will, I believe, prove beneficial. Opinion has modified its sign-off procedure so that editors must recheck pieces when pictures have been changed. Other departments will want to follow suit where this process is not already in place. And the picture desk – which does not choose every image for the many hundreds of stories published daily – has proposed sensible extra layers of verification, especially on sensitive topics or where iniduals are unknown to the person editing the piece. Greater ersity of all kinds among teams handling photos would broaden subject reference points.Extra checks will add time but are all the more important in a home-working environment, where the opportunity for a quick huddle that might prevent such errors has been lost. Speed may still be unavoidable when breaking news and hard deadlines meet, but otherwise it is worth remembering that there is less shame in slowing down than in stumbling.• Elisabeth Ribbans is the  and Observer’s global readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fbe8aaa4e774f8b55138e929c2e0c50a7aee7d2/0_0_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=81c550fe9c0137f630aefc0ff3ec734a","title":"tough choices need to be made but reopening schools is a priority","story":"Young people have been hugely affected by Covid-19. We must fight this rise in cases and make classrooms as safe as possible• See all our coronavirus coverageRebound, resurgence, second wave – whatever you call it, the current coronavirus situation is worrying. Evidence suggests new infections are increasing in many European countries, including Britain, while in the US, we see the dire consequences of lifting restrictions too early. Globally the pandemic continues to accelerate.We have already been here, of course. In early 2020, we had rising infection levels but didn’t take the necessary steps. The result was a painful lockdown that should have come sooner. Thousands of excess deaths occurred. We cannot make the same mistakes.Lockdown did allow us to control the virus’s spread, however, and summer has helped keep down infection levels, with many workplaces not fully reopened, universities and schools closed, public transport use down, while people are mainly meeting outside in warmer weather that is not conducive for viral survival.But the gradual uptick in cases has shown us we’ve now reached – if not already exceeded – the absolute limits of easing restrictions. The R value, which tells you how many people will get the virus if in contact with an infected person, is close to 1. There are worrying signs that we’re in danger of heading in the wrong direction.Young people have been disproportionately impacted by Covid. Closing classrooms damages their education and wellbeing, particularly the disadvantaged and vulnerable for whom school can be their one safe space. Education is a key route to reducing the social inequalities this disease exploits. Schools can also help young people understand this pandemic and the measures needed to cope with it. Opening schools will also allow parents to resume work.Many teachers are understandably worried – for their pupils, themselves and communities so it is vital we give them reassurance about their safety and enable them to feel confident to return.There is no such thing as zero risk, of course. While children are in less danger from the virus, opening classrooms will still increase mixing and community transmission. The situation will have to be monitored closely, so we can make changes quickly if outbreaks occur. But it is a risk we can take cautiously, if we take the actions needed over the next month to drive infection rates back down and make schools as safe as possible.We have only got a small window to reduce infections through public health measures: handwashing, wearing masks, keeping physical distances and increasing clinical care capacity. At the same time, we must keep developing vaccines, treatments and tests.Most urgently, we need to ramp up testing. We are not where we need to be. We must improve contact tracing, so we’re identifying more cases and providing better, faster data locally. We need to make it much easier for everyone to get tested, including those who have been in contact with cases or think they might be infected, whether they have symptoms or not. And we need to make sure the results are reported back to people quickly, to encourage them to adapt their behaviour and stop the ongoing transmission. The Test-Trace-Isolate system has to work and deserves all our support.”If we use this brief window wisely, we’ll be in the best position to reopen schools, protect healthcare workers and the vulnerable, restart the economy and prepare for what could otherwise be a tough autumn and winter. If we don’t, we may not be able to reopen schools without introducing new restrictions elsewhere. These are the trade-offs we face – if we do not act now.• Jeremy Farrar is director of the Wellcome Trust"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf0175b7c477f75e63d466322ae43ce9fc2c671e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a186ea12a821ca9c925ae8e04b65d90a","title":"a level students tell us how youre feeling about getting your results","story":"We’d like to hear from sixth form students about the upcoming results dayThis week, the Scottish Qualifications Authority came under fire after admitting it downgraded nearly a quarter of all the recommended A-level results, heightening existing fears that school leavers’ grades would be negatively impacted by the pandemic across the UK.However, some assessment experts have said that this year’s results, based on a combination of teachers’ recommendations, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, and statistical modelling by examiners, will be fairer than ever.As results day approaches, we’d like to hear from students about how they’re feeling, and what they’re expecting.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

It was put to Solskjær that Martial has become a powerhouse No 9. “Definitely. Anthony has made huge strides this season in many aspects of his game,” the manager said.“I like him scoring, him being in between the posts, scoring the simple goals – we know he can do worldies, like he’s done a few times. He’s in the gym a lot working on his fitness and strength. The staff have done a fantastic job with him. Physically, he is at the best level of his career and I’m just looking forward to seeing him improve. There’s more to come from him.”With Mason Greenwood also scoring 17 times Solskjær’s three forwards have contributed a total 62 goals. The Norwegian believes competition between them only raises standards. “Scoring goals is always good for strikers, seeing others score goals – it gives you as well a little bit of an edge because you don’t want to be behind them,” Solskjær said.“But you also play for the team and the three of them have been backing each other up. For me I hope they will continue their development as it will make for exciting times for United in the next few years.”For Monday’s straight knockout Europa League quarter-final against FC Copenhagen in Cologne, Solskjær has a selection dilemma regarding whether to retain Sergio Romero, who he often selects for cup competitions, or choose David de Gea, his regular No 1.“Sergio has shown how important he has been for us and for me, David is always performing. It is difficult, yeah. But it’s a nice problem to have.”Copenhagen were last Danish champions in 2018-19 and in Ståle Solbakken have a manager who is a compatriot of Solskjaer’s, the two knowing each other since their playing days in Norway. In two tenures at Copenhagen Solbakken has claimed eight Danish titles.Solskjær is clear that no pressure has been relieved by his team’s third-place Premier League finish. “I don’t think so because we went into this season knowing the Europa League is a great chance for us – to try and get a trophy but also to groom a few of the youngsters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f67ad05b2c76bcdd6313acdcb7c6075129e603/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60c5ac3c69daa76f799013165b85436b","title":"im 21 and ive never been kissed six people on big experiences they havent had","story":"We all remember our first kiss… but what if it hasn’t happened yet? And what about swimming in the ocean, riding a bike or going to the cinema? Amelia Tait talks to six people about things they haven’t doneI’m a very introverted, shy person. I don’t like to be hugged or touched. I think it has to do with my parents – they’re not touchy-feely and I’ve never seen them show each other any physical affection. My mum didn’t say “I love you” to me until I went to college. I was so shocked I forgot to say it back.I hung around with a lot of Christian girls in high school and they were adamant about not dating anyone. I didn’t drink or go to parties and none of my friends had boyfriends. Since getting to college, I’ve been on dates with guys, but I’ve dodged kissing. A year ago I was on a date with a guy and we were at his place watching a movie and he put his arm around me – I immediately said I had to go. It freaked me out so much that I haven’t been on a date since.I don’t really know why it scares me, but when it comes to fight or flight, I’m flight all the way. I think it’s anxiety – I don’t like going to the grocery store by myself or things like that. I wish I could just get my first kiss over and done with, but I can’t let it be some random guy. I’m excited to find the right person, but I think movies make relationships look too perfect. In real life, they can be pretty toxic. I don’t want that for myself.I don’t go out of my way to tell people I’ve never been kissed, but all my close friends know. Everybody thinks it’s fine. Up until a couple of months ago my best friend who I met in college hadn’t been kissed either. I was happy when she got a boyfriend they’re perfect for each other. It doesn’t bother me, because it’s not my time – everything happens for a reason.For now, I’m playing it by ear. I believe in the butterfly effect – once you do something, it sets you up for a different track in life. I don’t want to put too much pressure on myself – I know it’s eventually going to happen.I come from a family of bookworms. I remember a lot of Saturday afternoons spent with my brother and parents going in and out of bookshops when I was a child. For me, it didn’t spark any interest. Mum used to sit next to my bed and try to encourage me to read the Harry Potters, but I just wasn’t engaged.When I was 13 I read the whole of Anne Frank’s diary, but I didn’t read my GCSE English book, Lord of the Flies. I actually went to university and read English language and linguistics. I had to read, but I wouldn’t read a complete book I’d only read enough to get through the course.I work in the food industry now and I’ve tried choosing novels and nonfiction related to food and cooking, but even those don’t engage me. I’ve taken the same cookery science book on holiday for the past six years, but still haven’t finished it. I’d rather sit still and look at a view than read a book.That’s just how it is – some people don’t bake, some people don’t paint. I don’t read. When I was growing up it might have stalled my vocabulary a little, but there are other means of learning things. Other people may think I’m missing out, but I know no differently. I don’t feel as if I’ve deprived myself. I had a decent education and I don’t feel like it’s hindered me at all.My main interest is cooking – I feel the same escapism in the kitchen that I imagine a lot of other people find in reading a book. I love being outside, walking, sitting in the garden, painting, drawing and photography. It’s not like I’ve lost the ability to read, but I’d definitely rather spend time baking a cake than picking up a book.I’ve never left the UK. Never. I’ve never even had a passport. I’ve not even travelled much inside the UK – many, many years ago we went to Wales when I was a teenager, but I haven’t been on holiday since. In my adult life I haven’t done any travelling at all.The main reason is because I don’t have anyone to go with – I don’t have a wife or kids or anything like that. If you’ve never travelled before, it’s quite a big thing to do on your own. I don’t feel as if I can just hop on to a plane to the Middle East, because I’ve never done it before. And as I’ve never done it, it’s not something I’ve ever really missed. In my mid-20s I started to realise I was unusual, because that’s when people were going on gap years. I’ve worked since the age of 16 and never went to uni, so I’ve never had that “me time” to go and travel.I work in the civil service and don’t do a lot with my annual leave – in the past, I’ve not taken some of my holiday days and I’ve just let them expire. It’s probably not the healthiest way of doing things, but I’ve gone to work because I haven’t had anything else to do or anywhere else to be. A few times, I’ve allowed other people to take time off in my place. I’ll always work at Christmas, because I know there are people with families who want the time off.When people hear I haven’t been abroad, they’re very surprised and find it a bit weird. There are loads of places I’d like to go, but it’s not a huge priority. If I meet somebody and it gets serious, then I’ll definitely go away then. I’d like to go to France, Germany, America – and would love to see the Northern Lights. But while I’m on my own, I can’t envisage myself jetting off to the other side of the world.People generally don’t believe that I’ve never been to the cinema – it seems kind of unreal. I’ve seen pictures of cinemas online, but I haven’t actually been inside one. As a child I just never really had the opportunity my family was interested in other social stuff. We went to lots of museums.People think that because I don’t go to the cinema, I don’t watch movies, but I do. I don’t feel like I’m missing out because to me, watching a movie is a personal experience. If I’m in the cinema, I might not react to a movie the way other people react to it – I feel as if it would take away from the iniduality of the experience.I also really like watching movies with subtitles and I don’t think they have them in cinemas. I can’t really keep up with a movie’s plot and characters unless I’m reading along, just because I’ve always watched things that way.When I was about 12, I first realised it was weird that I’d never been to the cinema. I felt unique – it was something different from everyone else. Still, once the coronavirus situation changes then hopefully I’ll go as life is too short and I should experience it. I’ll probably see a sci-fi film or something like that. I’m excited for the large screen because it will be completely different from anything I’ve ever experienced – the closest thing I’ve done is go to a football game.One Tuesday in June in 1956, I fell down playing cowboys and indians in the school playing fields. I was eight years old, and I broke my arm so badly that I was in hospital for two weeks. For the next 18 months after that, I was in and out of hospital having physiotherapy. Because of that I never got on a bike. I was scared of breaking my arm again, it was that bad. I was always nervous playing football, too.I don’t feel like I’ve missed out, though. Around here lots of people ride bikes, but it’s not for me – I like playing chess. After I passed my driving test I was able to drive all over the country, and I go everywhere by car. The fact I can’t ride a bike doesn’t come up in conversation, people never ask that sort of thing. There’s no chance of me ever trying now – I’ve got severe arthritis and last year I had a hip replacement. I use a breathing machine at night. I’m falling to pieces.I also never learned to swim. I hated the water, it made me cough and splutter. They used to take my class at school and I stayed behind and did schoolwork – I just didn’t want to go. As a kid I wasn’t interested, but when I got older and was in my early 20s, I did feel like I was missing out. I used to sit on the side watching as people splashed about with their girlfriends in the water. I missed out on a lot of fun.I’ve always been really fascinated by the ocean, ever since I was a little girl. When I was five, I had a game for the Wii called Endless Ocean and it was like a swimming simulator – you would learn about different marine animals, like dolphins. I was amazed by it and I always wanted to go to the ocean.But my parents just don’t travel – I’ve only been out of the country once and that was for a school trip to New York City. My dad is out of the picture and my mum works as a youth worker 9-5, so we’ve never had enough money saved to leave home or go to the coast. We live fairly close to a lake, so in the summer we go there and nowhere else.I was around 10 when I realised my experiences were strange – I remember listening to my friends talking about going to Florida for vacation and saying it was weird I’d never seen the sea. Nowadays I have friends who’ve moved to the coast and they say they don’t even like the ocean, which sounds crazy to me.Seeing the sea is a goal that I strive towards. I want to see it by the time I’m 25 – I want to get a job first and save up some money to move out, and then I want to go on a big trip. My friends say I should just get it over with and go to Nova Scotia, but I don’t want to settle for a random coast – I’m expecting warm weather, cool water, nice sand. It’s going to be magical.It’s frustrating when people don’t understand that there are so many people who don’t have the opportunity to travel – they take it for granted. I know people who complain about going on vacation. They don’t appreciate the opportunities they have.

But understanding what you want from this relationship must be your priorityThe dilemma My partner’s relationships with other men is concerning me. She has admitted to sleeping with close to 100 men in the past, many for personal gain – including cash, gifts and holidays. I was shell-shocked, not so much that she participated, but that she confessed so blatantly. I also know that she has flirted with married men, enjoying dinner and sharing a hotel bed with one of them.To me it appears that as a woman who was abandoned by her father at a young age, she struggles to say no to men. She went on holiday with a female friend and came back with a new man’s number in her phone whom she messaged frequently, and said I was being silly when I asked about him. She has no qualms about telling me that her male colleagues look at her in a way that suggests they’re interested in her. She appears to thirst for this attention, perhaps subconsciously.Her reaction to my concerns is normally anger and so I avoid these topics, although inside me it is grating. I love her and have cut all ties with past flames, so she has nothing to worry about in terms of my faithfulness, but this is not reciprocated. Do I have it out with her, or shrug and accept that this is who she is?Mariella replies Where to begin? Certainly not with a headcount of past lovers, which means little or nothing and certainly has no real bearing on your current predicament. If you’re judging a partner by the number of people they’ve slept with, then your priorities are seriously questionable. Then again, I’m not impressed by the transactional nature of some of her past choices either. The question you should be asking is what this woman is looking for, and do you have the strength, courage or, indeed, desire to help her find it.She seems to need love, not in a clingy way but in a manner that aims to serve an all-consuming hunger for someone to feed her emotional cravings. You tell me a lot about her, but very little about you and why your needs and desires should be so sublimated. What do you want from this relationship? Do you want to be tortured in this way by the desirability and unpredictability of another?Your girlfriend sounds like she has issues with self-esteem and misplaced ideas of how to gain self-worth. I’m presuming much of what you describe has happened in the past and, as LP Hartley famously said: “The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there.” What happened before you two got together may offer you context, but it’s irrelevant when it comes to defining how she should behave in your relationship.I feel sorry for your girlfriend because losing your father as a young girl is as painful as parting can get, and instils in all but the most resilient a sense of failure and lack of self-value that can remain throughout life. I know quite a few women – myself included – who took until their late 30s or early 40s to shrug off that burden and realise that they don’t have to shoulder the blame or carry the responsibility for a parent’s absence.As you say, your partner seems to be trying to replace her father with any member of his sex that she thinks has the potential to fill the space he left behind. It’s not that she can’t say no to men but that she’s under the illusion that sheer weight of numbers will ground her desire.In reality, the unconditional love she seeks is the kind only a parent can offer. You can’t stop her mourning her father’s absence, but you can possibly help her see that what she’s looking for lies within her – and is for her alone to mend. This isn’t about the lovers she’s had, could potentially have or, in the worst-case scenario, continues to have. It’s about a damaged little girl trying to replace her first love with a succession of alternatives.You could be flattered that she has found enough of a home in you to slow the pace of her relentless quest, but as you’ve observed she’s not done searching. That’s why I asked at the beginning if you had the energy and commitment to try to help steer her to safe harbour. But the only way you can ever help anybody else is to first understand yourself, and I’d propose that’s where you begin this quest. Try to understand your own motivation in enduring the insecurity she provokes. While she works out her own priorities, what is obvious is that all this emotional fog leaves little room for a clear view – so neither of you knows yet if you have found what you’re looking for.Whether you can shape what you have into something less debilitating is a question I can’t answer, but bigger romantic miracles have occurred. In answer to your question, I don’t think you need have it out, nor shrug and accept – instead I suggest a more imaginative journey where you learn a lot more about your own desires as a route to finding out whether you can, or even want, to keep up with hers. Major emotional investment, resilience and commitment will be required along the way but your adventure will be fruitless if you don’t get to know the landscape of your own heart first.

We’ve had fewer options since lockdown, so I’m not surprised so many people have taken it up.”The Canal \u0026amp River Trust, the Outdoor Swimming Society and the Angling Trust are all reporting a surge in interest.“The recent boom has been driven by the accessibility of the sport, gyms being closed for so long, the desire to do something socially with friends and the sun shining,” said co-founder John Hibbard.Jenny Spencer of British Canoeing said: “Literally, from the day lockdown was eased a little bit and we were allowed outdoors, paddle sports just took off. People had spent a long time being cooped up indoors, and some were getting fed up with running and cycling.”A big proportion of new paddlers are families, and almost four in 10 are female. Growth has been mainly among those aged between 30 to 60, said Spencer.Thousands of miles of waterways in the UK mean most of the population is within reach of a river or a canal. “It’s peaceful and calming. People like having a new perspective on their surroundings,” she said.And it helps that social distancing is built into paddle sports.Jonathan Sullivan, 40, had been “toying with the idea for years” but had never got round to venturing out on the Trent and numerous canals around his home in Long Eaton, Derbyshire.Then lockdown happened. Sullivan and his wife, Michala, juggled working at home with caring for and home-schooling their two children, six-year-old William and Niamh, almost five.“We ran out of ways to entertain them. There wasn’t much to do, or many places to visit,” Sullivan said.They invested in a three-person inflatable kayak and a paddleboard. “It’s been a lot of fun exploring the waterways.” The family has gone wild swimming and taken picnics on paddling trips. “It’s a great way to spend time together.”Sullivan has also used paddling as a way to de-stress after long days at his computer. “I go on my own in the evening. It’s exercise, relaxation and fresh air all rolled into one.”A licence is required to paddle on waterways maintained by the Environment Agency and the Canal \u0026amp River Trust, and the Norfolk Broads. In Scotland, there is a “right to roam” over land and water.Two members of the House of Lords – Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the former Paralympian athlete, and Liberal Democrat peer Lord Addington – have proposed amendments to the agriculture bill, currently going through parliament, to allow the public better rights of access to rivers.Grey-Thompson said water activities helped people’s mental health and gave them a greater connection with nature. “There is something very calming about being near water – the sound of it, on a summer’s day, there is nothing that is more perfect,” she said in a recent podcast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0bdc7ad357fd24441422ef8705dedf9a84a5ea/527_0_5188_3115/master/5188.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5baf124cb7585ce5ee02bd6f492dfa9a","title":"house sale london location regents park bargain 185m john nash","story":"Developer seeks to cash out of investment in John Nash-designed terrace with views of Regent’s ParkDevelopers have stuck an asking price of £185m on a house overlooking Regent’s Park in central London in what would be the UK’s second most-expensive home purchase.The property firm Zenprop is targeting foreign billionaires as potential buyers of 1-18 York Terrace East as it seeks to cash out of a 2016 investment.The Grade I-listed building was completed in 1826 under designs by John Nash, the Regency architect whose other works include Buckingham Palace, Regent Street and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.If it were bought by an inidual it would represent the second most expensive house ever sold in the UK, despite the weakness in the luxury housing market caused by the pandemic. The Chinese property tycoon Cheung Chung-kiu agreed in January to buy a 45-room mansion overlooking Hyde Park in London for more than £200m.The York Terrace East property, with 117,000 square feet of floorspace, previously served as government offices and then student accommodation, after bomb damage during the second world war.Stephen Lindsay, an agent at Savills who is working on the property, said: “Nothing on this scale in such a prime London location has ever come up for sale.”Derrick Beare, chief executive of Zenprop, said the building was bought four years ago for less than the current £185m listing price, despite previous reports that the company paid £200m. “We would have made a very healthy profit, but because of Brexit and the pandemic, prices are not what they were,” Beare said.Beare said the property was “priced attractively for what it is” and described it as “one of the most amazing buildings I’ve ever seen”. He thought London would continue to be seen as safe for buyers. “People love to buy real estate here. I don’t think that is going to change.”Planning officials rejected a previous application for the building to be turned into townhouses because they would be too large, planning documents show.One super-rich inidual had considered buying the property to install one large dwelling in the terrace’s central block, with other houses either side, Beare said. However, the potential buyer put plans on hold because of Brexit and the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbebca46b4e2b8a6a1f7577ab006da683e63a81d/0_251_4447_2669/master/4447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f453979c1e4c595e44630b51dc3c49ef","title":"brazilian pop superstar anitta interview","story":"Born in Rio’s favelas, Anitta became Brazil’s biggest pop star. Then a political awakening made her even more influential. She talks Bolsonaro, Black Lives Matter and bisexualityAnitta had imagined that this summer would be a break: a period in which she could record new music. It would have followed 10 years in which she became Brazil’s biggest pop star, including stadium tours, a Netflix docuseries about her life, and hits with Madonna, Snoop Dogg and Rita Ora – all of which skyrocketed her from a Rio favela to fame. Instead, she’s been quarantining at home with her five dogs, infiltrating her country’s politics and being touted as a future Brazilian president.Anitta is amped up by it all because she’s seen that when she decides to speak, people sit up and take notice. A few weeks before we talk, she invited Brazilian politician Felipe Carreras to debate a contentious legal amendment that would have changed how artists get paid for their copyright. Anitta was enraged that Carreras introduced it – surreptitiously, she felt – at a time when Brazilians were distracted by the health crisis, and her anger was palpable during a tense 45-minute argument, broadcast to her 47m followers on Instagram Live. On stage she’s known for being bold and empowered, and she channeled that into the conversation she was tough, almost relentless. Three days later, Carreras withdrew the bill. “I felt like a hero,” Anitta tells me. “And then came the crazy part.”Advocates began alerting her to other causes they were working on. (She’s taken up a few, including deforestation in the Amazon.) By June, a poll in the newspaper O Globo indicated she was the third-most influential political figure in the country and fans urged her to run for president. “The law only gives you the right to run when you’re 35. I’m 27,” she says. “A lot of journalists were calling me, saying, ‘Are you going to listen to the people and run?’ I was like, ‘Guys, I’m just trying to help! Wait!’”Anitta talks a mile a minute – whether in Portuguese, Spanish or English – and she’s so emphatic you can practically hear her gesticulating. She’s known as a workhorse whose business savvy, stamina and drive pushed her to learn two additional languages to break market barriers.“Anitta stands out for her strong personality, focus and determination,” says Sérgio Affonso, president of Warner Music Brasil, the label that signed Anitta in 2013. He says that from the moment she released her first single, she paid careful attention to everything – streaming data, video concepts, social media – to consolidate her success. “She knows exactly what she wants and where she wants to go.”Her next move is to release an album, mostly in Spanish and English, through Warner Records in the US later this year. The first single is Tócame, a slinking, syncopating reggaeton track featuring the Puerto Rican rappers Arcángel and De La Ghetto that radiates with the party vibe from Anitta’s last album, Kisses. But she’s also working on Girl from Rio, a glossy, English-language R\u0026ampB track that samples the bossa nova classic The Girl from Ipanema – it’s a smoother, sleeker addition to Anitta’s energetic catalogue and has garnered 7.6bn streams.She doesn’t just want to be a musical ambassador, but to paint a full picture of Brazil in 2020, including its harsher realities. She says she “doesn’t approve Bolsonaro’s administration” and that he hasn’t “brought benefits to our nation”. She’s started Instagram Live sessions with Gabriela Prioli, a lawyer who gives classes on Brazilian legislation. Anitta has also spoken out about environmental challenges and, in more recent weeks, the Black Lives Matter movement and colourism – prejudice against darker skin among ethnic minorities – an issue that manifests in injustice and police brutality in predominantly black favelas. In Rio, where Anitta still lives, police killed 606 people between January and April this year.There are other markers of severe racial inequality. She brings up a much-discussed case in Brazil that has bleakly exposed questions of race and class: Mirtes Santana, a black domestic worker, left her five-year-old son with her boss, a white woman named Sarí Gaspar, while she ran an errand. When she returned, she found Gaspar had left the little boy alone in the elevator of her apartment complex. He wandered toward a window and fell to his death from the ninth floor. Gaspar was arrested but released on bail after paying £3,200. “Now imagine if it was the opposite,” Anitta said. “If there was a cleaner, a black woman, who’d left a kid alone in the elevator, do you think it would have been different?” Her voice shakes with anger.She doesn’t regret that it took her time to find her political voice. “I don’t have any shame in that, because I’m 27,” she says. “I started to have access to a good education after I got money, after I learned – by myself – how to build my company, how to run my own career. I think that it’s never too late. I’m proud of myself, that I woke up and I was like: ‘It’s important for me to get involved’.”Anitta seems to have learned over the years to separate helpful feedback from attacks on her personal life – the latter including a orce in 2018, her subsequent dating life, several plastic surgeries and the fact that she’s bisexual, all of which have made her Brazilian tabloid fodder. When people judge her for what she calls “normal things”, she says it only makes her more eager to be true to herself.“If I have a boyfriend and he wants to have a threesome or switch couples, I feel safe, and I don’t feel bad doing it if everyone doing it is happy,” she says. “I don’t care. My family knows about my bisexual life. I switch boyfriends as much as I switch outfits … The more people judge me, the more I want to say, ‘Hey guys, I do this and I do that! You want to know more? I also do this!’”Besides, she also doesn’t really have a lot of time for the gossip mill. By the time we finish talking, she tells me she has more phone calls and scenes to shoot for the second season of her Netflix series Vai Anitta. And then, she says excitedly, “We have political classes on my Live session!” It doesn’t sound too different to a politician’s daily schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7affb76762bb956b25436daf1fd3e02cdb4f4c1/0_379_5906_3546/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85dd147973c8758f9999716db637227c","title":"how the world is coping with coronavirus six months on","story":"From Portugal to Pakistan, the ’s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the different ways countries have been affected by the virus and the impact that is having on the lives of people thereIt’s six months since Covid-19 was registered as an urgent threat, and although the panic at the scenarios that filled imaginations in those first weeks – of millions of imminent deaths, medical systems buckling and food supplies running scarce – has largely abated, the virus has not. More than 200 days since coronavirus was first detected, public health authorities say the number of infections is accelerating and the peak still lies ahead. In early August, the world finds itself at a nebulous stage: past the shock of the pandemic but without a clear end in sight.  international correspondent Michael Safi talks to Rachel Humphreys about the different ways in which countries have dealt with the virus – from some in Europe who seemed to have bent the curve but are now experiencing a second wave to developing nations such as Pakistan who felt quarantine posed a greater risk to life than coronavirus itself.

Here it’s a great venue but it’s a bit hectic and a bit stressful. I’d rather take the Crawley option to be honest with you.”O’Sullivan’s slick performance saw him move two frames clear with breaks of 87 and 73 before Ding seized advantage of a rare missed black to reduce the deficit with a break of 88. O’Sullivan nudged 11-9 in front with a break of 60 and, after Ding cleared to brown in the next with a break of 81, O’Sullivan struck a superb 117 to move within a frame of victory. He narrowly missed back-to-back centuries but a 93 break in the next frame sealed the win.O’Sullivan said: “When you’re younger you have all the hunger and desire but at some point you have to try to get yourself motivated, whether that’s taking the pressure off or getting another hobby or job.“I was glad I was able to focus but I’m just more passionate and motivated about other things I’m doing off the table.

A fair chance, though, that at -8 he’ll register yet another top-ten finish at a major. If he does, it’ll be six out of 12. His time will come.Matthew Wolff, playing in his very first major, is the new clubhouse leader. He screeches his approach at 18 to five feet, and knocks in the birdie putt. It’s a strong finish ... a 65 ... and it gives him co-ownership of the tournament lead as well. That’s a gauntlet thrown down, though you suspect he might be a shot or two shy. Still, you never know. If he does make it, he’ll join Willie Park Sr., Francis Ouimet, Ben Curtis and Keegan Bradley in winning a major at his very first attempt!A loose tee shot at 12 costs Champ a shot. He slips back to -8 again. Grim-faced, he’s the bizarro Day right now. Meanwhile bogey for Casey at 13, the result of underclubbing his approach then compounding the error with a heavy-handed chip. Casey, chasing his first major at 43, looks more pensive than annoyed. He slips to -9.Day’s putter is warming up nicely. A 15-foot birdie effort across 14 threatens to lip out, but eventually drops after performing the wall of death. He joins the ever-expanding leading group, and celebrates accordingly. Of all the players out there, he’s the one enjoying himself the most obviously right now.Finau couldn’t make his two-putt par at 12, incidentally. It led to his first bogey of the day. But he bounces back brilliantly, curling in a right-to-left 30-footer on 13 to return to -9 immediately! Another vital one, right there, as time, holes and space for error start running out. The tension is palpable, events coming to the boil. Imagine the temperature if Harding Park was packed with punters!Casey’s second into 12 flies into the rough at the back. He chips back a little clumsily, six feet past. A tricky one coming back. But he nails it. That was so vital. He stays in a tie for the lead at -10.A slip-up by DJ on 10, as he sends his second into the bunker on the left. He’s shortsided, and can’t get close with his third. A huge birdie chance slips by, and that’s effectively a shot handed over to the field. His partner Scheffler makes no such mistake, and his birdie brings him into a four-way tie for the lead. Meanwhile a nice up-and-down from sand at 13 for Day. He remains at -9, where he’s joined by Wolff, who leaves his eagle effort short on 16 but makes no mistake with the resulting four-footer.Kim Si-woo, the youngest-ever winner of the unofficial fifth major, the Players Championship, is coming up quietly on the rail. Birdies at 2, 7, 10 and now 15, and he’s -8. A strong finish - like Ryan Palmer’s earlier eagle, birdie, birdie, for example - and he could post something to give the rest of the field pause. See also Matthew Wolff, who has just battered his tee shot at the short par-four 16th to the fringe. Outside chance of eagle.Jason Day did extremely well to save his par at 12, getting up and down from a greenside bunker. Tony Finau, coming behind, looks a good bet to save himself too, having driven into the trees but manufacturing a low fizzer and finding the dancefloor. Two long putts, but that’s a quite exceptional outcome from where he was. Meanwhile, Collin Morikawa joins the leaders with one of those must-make-really birdies at 10. His partner Cameron Champ regroups after that double with a bounceback birdie. He’s back to -9.Paul Casey grabs himself a share of the lead! He birdies the 10th after a crisp approach to ten feet, and his first major championship in his 64th attempt is a very real possibility now. He looks steady and calm, something he’s not always been at the business end of the majors. God speed. Are we about to see the first English winner of the PGA since Jim Barnes in 1919?! Meanwhile pars for Scheffler and Dustin at 9, and the final group hits the turn, ringing the bell for the start of the 2020 PGA Championship: it’s the last nine holes on major Sunday! Champ’s chip is tame and he leaves himself ten feet short. He can’t save himself with the flat stick this time, the ball shoved right, and it’s a painful double. He’s back where he started: -8.Finau doesn’t make the mistake of his partner DeChambeau, and makes a lovely boring birdie at 10. No fuss, no sweat, he’s going along very nicely at -9. Meanwhile on 14, Wolff, having missed two hige birdie chances on 12 and 13, overhits a short birdie putt. It horseshoes out, and he slips back to -8. What a sickening sequence for the young man.Back-to-back birdies for Jason Day, as he suddenly emerges into the light! He drains a long putt across 11, and suddenly he’s only a shot off at -9! Meanwhile more careless work around the green by DeChambeau, and it’s only a par on the par-five 10th.Champ is snookered behind a tree and is forced to chip out sideways. That’s terrible luck, though it was a godawful drive too. A bogey most likely now. Can he get up and down from 175? He shakes his head as he pushes his approach right, the ball taking a big kick further offline and into thick stuff. Meanwhile back on 8, a great up and down from sand for Scheffler, who is mooching along quietly after his opening birdie. He stays at -9. And his partner DJ gets up and down from thick grass at the front, and he stays at -10. Unless Champ chips in, he’ll be the sole leader soon.So having said that, Champ sends a big slice towards the trees down the right of the extremely difficult 9th. God speed. Birdies for Jason Day on 10, and Li Haotong at 14 they’re both -8 and this is an excellent performance from Li in particular, after all he’s been through this week.Champ trundles in his par saver! What nerves of steel! That was heading into the centre of the cup from the very second it left the face of his flat stick. He remains at -10 and right now has the determined look of the man to beat. The 25-year-old Californian already has two wins to his name in his short PGA Tour career ... and he’s been the longest hitter this week. A telling stat, because the longest hitter has won seven of the last 30 PGA Championships. What a story this would be.Champ takes an eyeful of sand as he whacks out of the bunker at 8. It’s a decent long bunker shot, but not an exceptional one, and he’ll need to sink a 20-footer to save his par. Meanwhile up on 13, Wolff wastes another great birdie chance, knocking his approach to five feet but shoving it wide left with great uncertainty. He should be leading after back-to-back birdies as it is, he’s still one behind Champ and Johnson at -9.DeChambeau has left himself an 11 foot 3 inch putt from the fringe at 9. He hits it 11 feet and 2 inches. He taps in with a frown. All of a sudden, he’s taken a screeching u-turn and is heading backwards in the grand fashion. Like his partner Finau, he’s turning in 33 at -8, but you know full well who’s the happier bunny right now. DeChambeau trudges off with hands in pockets, a study in dejection.Tony Finau has been quiet since that birdie-birdie opening salvo. But he’ll be happy enough with the seven pars that follow. He hits the turn in 33, and at -8 is still right in the mix, without breaking too much sweat and using up all that precious emotional energy. He might need it later. What am I saying? Of course he’ll need it later. Business end of a major championship coming right up!Champ slam-dunks his tee shot at 8 into the bunker guarding the front right of the green. One club short. That’ll be a long, long sand shot. Also in trouble, DeChambeau up on 9, who fires a long birdie putt past the hole and onto the fringe behind. He has the good grace to look embarrassed at putting off the green.Some news of Tommy Fleetwood, and it isn’t good. His weekend struggles continue, after yesterday’s ground-out 70. Birdies at 5 and 7, but a double at 6, the result of a woefully wayward drive, and another bogey at 9 means he’s turning in 36. At -5, he’s too far back with too many players up ahead. That 64 on Friday looking like an outlier now. But here’s some better news for English fans, as Paul Casey keeps on keeping on. Par at 8 and he stays at -9.A lovely second into Wolff to six feet. But there’s a bit too much juice behind the birdie putt, and a chance to birdie a very difficult hole is gone. He remains one off at -9.DeChambeau does pretty well to clear his head and, from the fringe, lag a putt up to kick-in distance. He limits the damage to bogey, but drops out of the lead.DeChambeau fluffs his chip from the side of 8. Deceleration to the max! The first sign of nerves shown by any of the leading contenders today. Unless you count Koepka, which I’m afraid we no longer are. He three-putts on 7, his second bogey of the day, and the three-peat dream is over. He’s -5, and even if he puts a run together, there are surely too many players ahead of him - 15 to be precise - for at least one not to head him off at the pass.Bryson’s tee shot at 8 isn’t all that, yanked into the cabbage to the left of the green. There’s enough green for an up and down, but it’s still a job of work. Meanwhile on 6, Champ snatches a share of the lead by sending a 56-foot downhill tramliner into the cup! That putt statistically had a two percent chance of dropping. He joins DeChambeau and Johnson on -10. This is gloriously daft!A rare old birdie for DeChambeau at 7. Having driven into the greenside bunker, he looks to have hit his sand shot a wee bit too clean. But just as it seems to be bounding through the green and off the other side, the ball puts the brakes on. Screech! In goes a 15-footer coming back, and it’s his fourth birdie of the day. DeChambeau’s best finish in a major came in his first as a professional, a tie for 15th at the 2016 US Open. He’s now joint leader of this one at -10.Koepka is gone. He hoicks his drive at 7 into thick filth down the left of 7. He doesn’t look at the races today shades of the way he stumbled out of the traps at Portrush last summer. Trouble for Morikawa at 6 he flays his drive between trees down the left, and can only squirt out into thick rough front-right of the green. That’ll be a testing up and down.Schauffele shortsides himself at the 10th. He can’t get up and down from sand, and it’s just a par at a hole that’s been shedding birdies all week. He remains at -7, and the feeling of a huge missed opportunity is enhanced when his partner Matthew Wolff races in a 20-foot eagle effort to zip up to -9. That followed three birdies in a row he’s picked up five shots in double-quick time. Good luck calling the winner of this!Patrick Reed is having a good day. Birdies at 4, 5, 10 and now 14 bring him up to -7. Meanwhile up on the 18th, the world number one Justin Thomas signs for a level-par 70 the 2017 champ ends the week at -1.Li Haotong has turned things round nicely. He looked a beaten docket after last night’s bad luck was compounded by bogey at 2 today. But he’s birdied 5, 7 and now 10, and he’s in the group at -7. Marvellous to see he was so unfortunate to lose a ball up a tree yesterday evening.It’s just not happening for the reigning champ Brooks Koepka. A straight birdie putt on 6 is left meekly short. A par, but he’s stalled at -6, currently four off the lead and three behind the big pack in second. Too many players in his way? Seems daft to say, but the big man is running out of time.Bounceback birdie for Dustin on the par-five 4th! It’s a hole he’d have been expecting to birdie, but not like this, curling a tricky 12-footer from the fringe. But that steadies the ship after his dismal three-putt on 4, and he hits the lead again!Thanks to Tom. Nothing much has changed since I took that quick break, right? Ah. Right, let’s see where we are ... bloody hell!There are now 16 players within three shots of the lead, although it will probably be 43 by the time I finish this sentence (Casey has just joined the leaders at -9). Champ gets out of the bunker nicely and birdies the fourth to take his place in a four-way tie for the lead at -9. And Morikawa joins him! He’s now at -9! I don’t think we’re going to get a runaway winner today...Scheffler and Johnson don’t get too close to the hole with their tee shots on the par-three third, but neither of them are in trouble. DJ’s first putt is well short of the hole though, and he’ll be left with a tricky third shot, which he ... misses! He’s back at -9. Scheffler is much closer after his second and is left in tap-in territory. It’s now DJ, Scheffler and DeChambeau tied for the lead at nine under.Elsewhere, Casey is now -8 after a birdie on the fourth, he’s started his day very well indeed.DJ chips to within six feet of the flag on the second - it’s a tricky putt with a slight slope down to his left but he handles it well for par. Scheffler also takes a par on the same hole. Elsewhere, Morikawa’s first birdie of the day on the third means he is now -8.Let’s see how DJ goes as he takes his second shot from the bunker on the second - it’s a good lie though and he’s out easily enough. DeChambeau’s promising early charge continues - he is inches short of an eagle on the fourth but taps in for a birdie and he’s now nine under and just a shot off the lead. Fleetwood’s birdie on the fifth takes him to -7. Dustin Johnson’s tee shot finds a bunker on the left on the second but Scheffler’s drive is straight and true. Champ’s birdie putt trickles just wide on the second.DJ cleans up for his birdie, while his partner Scottie Scheffler, making his PGA debut this week, matches the score. This leaderboard is going to change by the minute this afternoon, soAnd with that, I’ll hand you over to Tom Lutz. See you again soon!DJ is out and about. He crashes his drive down the middle, and chips calmly from 50 yards to six feet. Koepka meanwhile can’t make his 15-foot par putt at 2, and the reigning champ goes backwards. He’s -6, and passes Xander Schauffele, who heads the other way upon registering back-to-back birdies at 5 and 6. He’s -7.DeChambeau lags up from 40 feet at 3. Par. Finau’s effort, from half the distance, needs just the one more turn to drop for the perfect start. But he’ll be happy with par too. Both remain at -8. But there’s bother for Koepka at 2, as he hits overhanging branches down the left and comes up short. Left in thick cabbage, he can’t flop close. Trouble here. Meanwhile back on 1, Morikawa splashes out from the sand too energetically and his ball trundles way past the flag. But he rattles in a 25-footer to scramble his par, a huge save that keeps him at -7.CBS segue to a commercial break with the bongtastic strains of Estimated Prophet by the Grateful Dead. Sing along, Bryson with feeling, Brooks. “California! I’ll be knocking on the golden door  Like an angel standing in a shaft of light  Rising up to paradise, I know I’m gonna shine.” DeChambeau and Finau both find the heart of the green at the par-three 3rd Collin Morikawa sends his approach at 1 into the bunker on the right, where he’ll be shortsided.A huge smile across Finau’s face, as he rolls a 20-foot birdie putt straight into the cup on 2. A fast start for a player who has to make the major breakthrough sometime soon, he surely has to. DeChambeau follows him in, and this pair are inspiring each other to great things already!DeChambeau has come flying out of the traps. He crashes a 344-yard drive down the middle of 2, then eases a glorious approach to three feet. That is quite magnificent. Back on 1, pars for Koepka and Paul Casey, the latter doing very well to make his four after copping an unlucky lie in the rough off the tee. They remain at -7.Good old CBS. As well as having a lovely logo, they flash up some very interesting infographics. Should Brooks Koepka win today, he’ll become the fastest man to reach five majors after winning the first one. He’ll have done it within 1,148 days Tiger took 1,225, while Jack Nicklaus needed 1.394, the slowcoach. Arnold Palmer needed 1,463 days, while Ben Hogan took 1,687. Nick Faldo’s next on the list with 1,827. So there you have it, in living color. Perhaps the big eye in the sky is looking down on him, too, because while he flays his opening drive into thick stuff down the left, it sits up. He’s able to find the green with his second, and while he can’t generate the spin to go close, he’ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet or so.Back to 1, where Finau has cleverly left himself a good yardage for his wedge. He knocks it dead. He’ll tap in to move to -7. DeChambeau meanwhile faces a more awkward 50-yard chip, but he scoops it to four feet. Delightful, and in goes the putt. He’s started with birdie too! A three-putt bogey for Varner III at 8, though, and he drops back to -5.Up on 18, Rory whisks his second to eight feet, but leaves the putt on the high side. A great chance for a valedictory birdie gone, he cocks his head back in mild despair. It’s not been his week. Not awful, not great. That final hole was his tournament in microcosm, basically. A 68, and he ends the week at -2. Much to think about, though all is far from lost. Up on the green, Jason Day, having stuck his second to eight feet, walks his birdie putt in. Calm and confident, he immediately rises to -7. His partner Justin Rose has to make do with par, but that’s better than yesterday, when he left this hole having made a bogey and railing at his caddy for some minor club-selecting misdemeanour.Here comes Bryson! A no-nonsense start as he absolutely pearls his first drive down the right-hand side of the fairway. Just the 320 yards of carry. He’s going round with Tony Finau, who isn’t shy of knocking the cover off the ball himself, but opts to send a controlled fairway wood down the middle instead. This pairing promises plenty of crash-bang fun ... and no little finesse around the green.Daniel Berger drains a 30-footer on the 1st to save his par. He remains at -6. In contention and in form, that’s a huge moment if he ends up making it today. Meanwhile another birdie for Adam Scott, this time at 10, and he rises to -5.

On the Galápagos islands, it’s the basis of a mating ritual on Tinder, it might get you banned.But as we learned form the first of this tremendously informative six part series, Equator, about the equatorial region’s flora and fauna (Sky Nature), sexy inflatable neck pouches aren’t all that the frigate bird has got to offer. Rather, what’s most striking is the way it has hitched its evolutionary wagon to the booby bird, even changing its breeding patterns to synchronise with the boobies and shadowing them through the Pacific skies before pouncing and seizing their dinner. In human terms, it’s like a Deliveroo driver being stalked by a rival with a clever, if illegal, business model. We saw a booby plunge head first into the sea to seize a fish. But as it rose skywards with its catch, a frigate bird – a kind of airborne pirate – eyed it narrowly and then swooped. The frigate bird is poor at catching fish, but superb at stealing another bird’s catch. It seized the tail of the booby midair and shook it until the booby released the fish from its gullet. The frigate bird then swooped to catch the falling fish and flew off to feast on it. Such niche evolutionary moves are not unusual here, as we will see in a moment when we consider the incredible shrinking marine iguana. Or consider the butterfly fish: in the Palmyra atoll, also along the equator, they feed on coral reefs, while in the waters of the eastern Galápagos they become cleaner fish, dining on bigger fishes’ parasites.The frigates’ midair thieving must be distressing to boobies because life on the Galápagos is otherwise chill, with no natural land predators. The giant cormorant has gone a stage further in lowering its evolutionary guard: over millennia it has stopped using its wings for flying.The makers of Equator carved their own niche in a TV environment where it’s adapt or die. Like the bump-headed parrot fish, which spends its life eating coral with a parrot-like beak, excreting sand and head-butting sexual rivals at mating time. Or the giant manta ray, which is three metres wide, most of it mouth, down which it sucks zooplankton as it rises. Similarly, the programme makers conferred on themselves an evolutionary advantage by not doing what everybody else in natural history docs does. How delightful that they dispensed, in particular, with some preening presenter who, after racking up air miles to get on location, lectures us on environmental damage as they interpose themselves between viewers and what the programme is notionally on about. How nice that here humans aren’t the stars of the show.Equator – though by no means as visually sumptuous as Blue Planet – was probably more informative than much of David Attenborough’s hallowed oeuvre. Well-judged graphics and a literate script helped me understand for the first time how the spin of the sun and the Earth combine to produce trade winds, and that the resultant oceanic currents and cross-currents create microclimates such as those around the Galápagos.However, the best thing about the documentary was its rebuke to human hubris. Consider the Galápagos’s marine iguana. Have you ever shrunk yourself by a quarter to give yourself a greater chance of survival than your peers in cooler temperatures? Have you lowered your heart rate and body temperature by more than 10C so you can e to the seabed and graze on algae for two hours without freezing to death, in waters 15 degrees colder than the surface? Have you then struggled to return to the surface, or even digest said algae because your muscles are so cold? And so have you spread yourself out on a rock, suppressed hunger pangs and waited for hours for the equatorial sun to warm you so that you can digest the food that’s been sitting heavy in your stomach?If you answered yes to any of the above, strap yourself in for a lie detector test. In truth, like me, you haven’t got what it takes to survive in extremis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de2a94c8efaa88ac2a31a7dc96045b68fab9c8ba/0_72_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b2c9b3513036be8ad21c28d0646eea9f","title":"only half of britons would definitely have covid 19 vaccination","story":"Survey sparks concern over misconceptions about vaccines and scepticism about science The study found vaccine rejection was strongest among those  whose beliefs reflect greater scepticism about science and who are less concerned about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Likely refusal was also linked to those who tended to be less willing to wear face masks and who said they got most of their information about the disease from WhatsApp and other social media outlets.The trends revealed by the study – which was based on 2,237 interviews with UK residents aged 16-75 and which was carried out online in mid-July – have triggered dismay among scientists. “Misperceptions about vaccines are among our most directly damaging beliefs, and they’re clearly influencing people’s intentions during the coronavirus crisis,” said prof Bobby Duffy, director of King’s College London’s the Policy Institute, which led the study.“While one in six in the UK say they are unlikely to or definitely won’t get a potential vaccine against Covid-19, this rises to around a third or more among certain groups, with a clear link to belief in conspiracy theories and mistrust of government, authority and science.”This point was backed by Gideon Skinner, research director at Ipsos Mori. “Almost a quarter of 16-34-year-olds are saying they’re unlikely to get vaccinated for Covid-19 if one becomes available.

Please do get in touch with news from your part of the world if we’ve missed it.You can find me on Twitter @helenrsullivan or send an email to helen.sullivan@the.British prime minister Boris Johnson said reopening schools in September was a social, economic and moral imperative and insisted schools would be able to operate safely despite the coronavirus pandemic. His comments follow a study earlier this month which warned that Britain risks a second wave of Covid-19 in the winter twice as large as the initial outbreak if schools open without an improved test-and-trace system. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said restarting schools was a national priority. Schools would be the last places to close in future local lockdowns, he was quoted by another newspaper as telling a meeting on Thursday. Schools in England closed in March during a national lockdown, except for the children of key workers, and reopened in June for a small number of pupils. “Keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible,” Johnson wrote. The economic costs for parents who cannot work if schools are shut are spiralling, and the country faces big problems if children miss out on education, the prime minister warned. “This pandemic isn’t over, and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent. But now that we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely, we have a moral duty to do so,” Johnson wrote. The headteachers’ union has criticised Johnson’s push and warned that schools will teach pupils on a “week on-week off” basis if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus, and are drawing up a number of contingency plans, according to the . The Sunday Times newspaper reported that Johnson has ordered a public relations campaign to ensure schools open on time. New York’s governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Sunday that the infection rate in the state is now at its lowest since the start of the outbreak.According to the New York Times, infections in the US are now rising fastest in the states of Virginia, Illinois, Hawaii, South Dakota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, as well as in Puerto Rico.Brazil has registered 23,010 new coronavirus infections to Sunday, taking the overall official tally in the country to 3,035,422.The health ministry also announced 572 new deaths, bringing the total Covid-19 death toll to 101,049.The UK’s official Covid-19 daily death count could be scrapped following an investigation into Public Health England’s method of counting the toll, The  newspaper reported. The conclusions of the investigation, which was ordered by health secretary Matt Hancock after it emerged officials were “exaggerating” virus deaths, are expected this week, the newspaper said. One recommendation could be to move to a weekly official death toll instead, a government source told the .Britain paused its daily update of the death toll last month and the government ordered a review into how Public Health England reports coronavirus deaths, after academics said the daily figures may include people who died of other causes. Academics in a blog post had warned that the way the government health agency calculated the figures was skewed as patients who tested positive for coronavirus, but are successfully treated, will still be counted as dying from the virus “even if they had a heart attack or were run over by a bus three months later”, Reuters reports.England’s death figures vary substantially from day to day due to this reason, the academics had argued. In contrast, the other parts of the United Kingdom do not follow the same approach. There is a cut-off threshold of 28 days in Scotland after a positive test, after which a patient is not automatically considered to have died from the virus. Britain, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus, reported more than 1,000 new Covid-19 infections on Sunday, its highest daily increase since June, taking the total number of cases past 310,000.Belarus police fired stun grenades and began detentions in a crackdown on protests that erupted as president Alexander Lukashenko was set to claim another election win on Sunday in the face of the biggest challenge in years to his grip on power. Thousands of people took to the streets of Minsk while protesters clapped, shouted “victory” and honked their car horns in solidarity with the opposition. Police blocked off streets and at least 10 people were detained in one spot in Minsk, a Reuters witness said, while local media reported detentions and clashes between police and protesters in the capital and other cities. The internet and social media networks experienced disruption. The government said in a statement that no protesters had been injured. A former Soviet collective farm manager, the authoritarian Lukashenko has ruled the country since 1994 but has battled a wave of anger over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy and his human rights record. Foreign observers have not judged an election to be free and fair in Belarus since 1995. Wedded to a Soviet-style economic model, Lukashenko has struggled to raise incomes and living standards in recent years. He also faced anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which he dismissed as a “psychosis” while suggesting drinking vodka and playing ice hockey as remedies.  Around 850 French passengers who were onboard a coronavirus-riddled cruise ship that was turned away from numerous ports in March have filed a collective suit in Paris with 180 complaints, including manslaughter, against Costa Cruises, their lawyer said on Sunday. The class action, which includes complaints from the families of three passengers who died of Covid-19, accuses the Italy-based cruise giant of negligence and various faults during their trip on the Costa Magica. From 6 to 13 March the ship was refused to dock in most of the Caribbean islands it visited, including Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados and Saint Lucia. In the absence of stopovers, the crew encouraged the passengers to use the ship’s shops, spas, restaurants and casino without sufficiently putting health measures in place, or informing them there were suspected infections onboard, the complainants said in their suit. The staff members on the ship “were at fault, the passengers had almost no information and only found out from local media that there were cases on the ship,” lawyer Philippe Courtois, who represents the collective of some 850 French passengers, told AFP. Courtois also criticised the “extremely light” virus measures on the ship. “It was meant to be a dream cruise, but it ended in an ordeal,” he said. Costa Cruises, which is part of the Carnival group, has suspended its trips worldwide until 15 August due to the pandemic. All arrivals coming to Germany from high-risk areas are subject to compulsory coronavirus testing since Saturday, amid a rise in the country’s infections.On Sunday morning, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reported 555 new infections, markedly lower than on the previous three days, which saw infections topping 1,000 for three days in a row.If you have arrived in Germany since Saturday, I am keen to hear about your experience.If you have updates on the pandemic from any other place in the world, I’d also love to hear from you, you can message me on Twitter @JedySays or email me.A total of nine students and staff members at a Georgia high school that made national headlines after a photo shared on social media showed its hallways packed with teenagers, many of them not wearing masks, have tested positive for the coronavirus, my colleague Tom Lutz reports.North Paudling High School principal Gabe Carmona wrote Saturday that six students and three staff members returned positive tests in a letter obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Hannah Watters, a sophomore at the school who was initially suspended for posting the photo to Twitter, has since had her punishment revoked, CNN reported.Elsewhere in Georgia, the AP reports that school officials in a nearby metro Atlanta county said 12 students and two staff members across a dozen schools tested positive for the virus during their first week back at school. The Cherokee County school system reported that more than 250 students with potential exposure had been sent home to quarantine for two weeks.As our Ed Pilkington wrote today, Georgia is one of 21 states across the US that have been placed by the White House coronavirus taskforce in the “red zone”, indicating the disease is now so prevalent that immediate restrictions must be imposed to avoid dire consequences.A large study on the transmission of coronavirus in schools, involving about 20,000 pupils and teachers in 100 institutions across the UK, will confirm that “there is very little evidence that the virus is transmitted” there, according to a leading scientist, the Sunday Times reports.Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and a member of the government advisory group Sage, said: “A new study that has been done in UK schools confirms there is very little evidence that the virus is transmitted in schools.“This is the some of the largest data you will find on schools anywhere. Britain has done very well in terms of thinking of collecting data in schools.”The study is being carried out by Public Health England and is expected to be published later this year.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 4,974,959 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 54,590 cases from its previous count a day prior, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 1,064 to 161,284. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as Covid-19, caused by a new coronavirus, as of 4pm ET on 8 August.The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by inidual states.Despite international tourism facing its worst crisis since records began, Saudi Arabia has agreed with Europe’s biggest hotel group Accor for the group to expand and operate a resort at the $20 billion Al-Ula tourism project in the kingdom’s northwestern region, the Royal Commission for the project said on Sunday. Al-Ula, the site of an ancient civilisation in a remote northwestern corner of the country, is part of plans by the world’s top crude exporter to ersify its economy away from oil and open up after decades of seclusion, Reuters reports.The agreement will see Accor operate an expanded Ashar Resort under the Banyan Tree brand, with 47 new units bringing the resort’s total capacity to 82 high-end villas, along with a spa and several gourmet restaurants, a commission statement said.  The project is located in the Ashar valley, 15 km (9 miles) from the Kingdom’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hegra. The ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom, relatively closed off for decades, has in recent years relaxed strict social codes such as the segregation of men and women in public and the requirement that women wear all-covering black robes, or abayas. Al-Ula’s development is part of a push to preserve pre-Islamic heritage sites in order to attract non-Muslim tourists and strengthen national identity. It plans an official opening to the world as a year-round destination in October 2020. The kingdom closed its borders to foreign “umrah” pilgrims and to tourists from at least 25 countries in late February. In March, it barred all travel in and out of the country. Saudi Arabia has reported 287,262 cases of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 3,130 deaths so far. Binational couples separated by coronavirus travel and immigration restrictions will soon be granted a ‘laissez-passer’ - a special exemption that allows the partner from the high-risk country to be reunited with their partner in France, the daily Sud Ouest reports.Since travel restrictions and lockdown rules were introduced in France in March, some couples have been living a long-distance relationship in two different countries. Secretary of state for tourism and French people Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne announced on Saturday that a derogatory procedure would allow binational couples to meet again.From Monday, a laissez-passer can therefore be issued in consulates for one of the spouses to join the other in France. They “must present themselves at the consulate with documents attesting to common activities, their identity documents, proof of residence in France for the French spouse, a return ticket”, Lemoyne said.Greece has recorded 203 new infections in the 24 hours to Sunday, its highest daily tally since the start of the outbreak in the country, a government official said. The latest jump in cases brings the total number of infections in the country to 5,623 since its first infection surfaced in late February, Reuters reports.Britain’s confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 1,062 on Sunday, going over 1,000 for the first time since late June.As cases rise in the country, new local lockdowns are implemented in some areas and worries over a second wave of infections are rife. Official data showed Sunday’s reported cases are 304 higher than the 758 new cases reported on Saturday. In mid-June, the World Health Organization advised that England’s coronavirus lockdown should not be further lifted until the government’s contact-tracing system has proven to be “robust and effective”, after widespread criticism of the first results of the government’s new tracking operation.Non-essential shops began reopening in England and Northern Ireland in mid-June, and in Wales and Scotland later that month. Hotels, pubs and restaurants in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland followed suit in July, though customers were only allowed back inside Welsh pubs and cafes in the first week of August.As confirmed coronavirus cases in the US have hit 5 million on Sunday, by far the highest of any country, the failure of the world’s most powerful nation to contain the virus has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe, the Associated Press reports.Perhaps nowhere outside the US is America’s bungled virus response viewed with more consternation than in Italy, which was ground zero of Europe’s epidemic. The Italian government was unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February, and the country still has one of the world’s highest official death tolls at 35,000. But after a strict nationwide, 10-week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment.“Don’t they care about their health?,” Patrizia Antonini, a mask-clad woman asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome.Much of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didnt have when the first Covid-19 patients started filling intensive care units.Yet, more than four months into a sustained outbreak, the US reached the 5 million mark, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. “We Italians always saw America as a model,” said Massimo Franco, a columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. “But with this virus we’ve discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.” Italian health minister Roberto Speranza hasn’t shied away from criticizing the US, officially condemning as wrong the decision of the Trump administration to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and expressing amazement at president Donald Trump’s virus response.After Trump finally donned a mask last month, Speranza told La7 television: “I’m not surprised by Trump’s behavior now Im profoundly surprised by his behavior before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917217d7da8f00c656514f54525444b855762042/0_0_3949_2368/master/3949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f2ab256078629d05d3238e960536491","title":"coronavirus live news us infections pass 500000 as greece sees highest ever daily cases","story":"US cases pass 5m French virus ship passengers sue cruise company UK daily infections pass 1,000 for first time since June.

I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Photograph: James CrombieInphoWe have queries from Colombia and London this week in connection with a most Irish operation. However, at risk of stating the obvious, 2020 has not been a good year. David Clancy paid €56 for the service on February 16th this year. Within a few weeks – on March 9th – he says GAAGO “stopped providing the service I paid for. No live matches were shown after this date.”On March 12th he got an email from the service confirming that all GAA was to suspended until the end of March. A few days later he contacted the service to find out what would be happening as there were no games scheduled. He says he was told “there would be a fair and practical resolution”.Then on March 27th, he received a mail saying GAAGO had opted to pause his subscription. “On April 23rd as it became clear the season would not resume, particularly the MunsterLeinster hurling championships, I asked for a refund and was told that GAAGO would make a fair decision in regards to annual pass subscriptions and what the best form of action will be.”In the middle of July he got an email saying his annual pass would be extended by three months from February of next year to the end of May.He wasn’t happy with that at all and on July 17th he asked for a refund with an explanation as to why he believed a refund was due. “The extension would provide no value as there are few matches between March and May, and there will be fewer matches this season due to the curtailment of the championships.”He was told that because he had used the service to watch free content in recent months, which they claim is worth up to €90, “I could not have a refund and they would not have any further communication with me on the matter”.“This is not the service I signed up for and is not the fair and practical resolution I was led to believe would occur. I don’t want to accept this downgrade of the service, which would mean fewer top- level matches, and more lower level games to end-May 2021. I have not accessed any of their services since I was informed of the extension except to raise support tickets to complain. As I have not received the services as promised, I would like a refund of €56 from GAAGO.Next up was Declan Carey from Colombia. “I have been based overseas and will be returning permanently in September,” his mail starts. “I have availed of the annual pass for the GAAGO platform while abroad to enjoy the All-Ireland series. While the platform offers other things such as historical repeats, it is clear that the driver of the platform is the enjoyment of key games over the summer and this is reflected in the pricing,” he says, pointing out that the price per game increases as one gets closer to the All-Ireland finals. “It is suggested that the annual pass is more cost-effective as one can enjoy more of these high-profile games at an affordable price. Given the unique circumstances this year with Covid, I had assumed GAAGO would be contacting all subscribers to make some adjustment to recognise the impact of the lost games and new timing,” he writes. “This would be consistent with the insurers’ approach to car insurance and the GAA itself, which has offered adjustments to people who had purchased season tickets to see the games in person. I was therefore surprised when, after contacting GAAGO, they advised no adjustmentdiscountrefund would be offered.” He says they seem to be treating people who paid the see the games in person differently from those who paid to see the games on television. “I haven’t been able to make any progress with GAAGO, so any effort you could make to pressure them to change this unreasonable approach to discriminate against Irish people based overseas would be appreciated.”So we got in touch with RTÉ who put us in touch with GAAGO. A spokesman said that the GAA had first announced the suspension of all activity on March 12th – initially until March 29th. The suspension was subsequently extended on a number of occasions in line with updated government policy. He said that once a return to live action was confirmed, “we started considering what a fair approach would mean in practice. In doing this, we took into account purchase dates, the product purchased, prospective renewal timings, and the GAA calendar itself (this year and next year) and generated a number of subscriber groups with similar circumstances, eg ‘have mostly received pass value’, ‘recently renewed, therefore not much value received yet’ etc. By offering a mix of pass extensions and discounts on renewals, we believe we took a fair approach for each customer group.” He said the vast majority of customers had been happy with the approach. “We take our customer service seriously and recognise that there will be exceptions, which is why we always try to treat each situation uniquely. We know from feedback that not every service does this, and we’ve frequently put in significant effort into particular customer cases to find a satisfactory solution. This helps us build a good reputation among the expat community, and to retain customers, which thankfully we do well.” He added that the both of these cases had been discussed before we made contact. “In one case, we don’t feel that a user who wasn’t entitled to a refund pre-Covid should suddenly become entitled to one afterwards, as the service is being delivered as promised, albeit on a different timescale due to extraordinary factors outside of our control. As a conciliatory gesture, though, we agreed to a further extension (beyond what we originally felt was a fair resolution), as evidently that particular customer was not satisfied with the original 3.5-month extension. “The other case has already been resolved once it got escalated upwards. Our initial response should have been better and we have discussed this as a team and learned from it. Again, we made a goodwill gesture to resolve this issue to the customer’s satisfaction.”That all seems fair enough to us. Voucher better than nothing for cancelled flightDavid Langan sent us a query in connection with Aer Lingus that he wondered if we had previously focused on. He bought a ticket with Aer Lingus on December 16th, 2019 to fly from Dublin to LAX return on March 26th, returning six days later. “On March 18th I received an email from Aer Lingus offering a change of flight or a voucher. At that time I applied for a voucher. I, like many people at the time hoped that the virus situation would not last too long and I would book the flight in summer this year. Aer lingus did not offer money back at that time.” He said that since then he has not received the voucher from Aer Lingus. “I did contact them two days ago and they said it is being processed. I asked for my money back and they said I could not have that . I said, well, they don’t fly to LAX now and either way I can’t go because of the rules from the State Department with Irish passport holders. Aer Lingus said the flight I had originally booked did operate and voucher was all I could get.” He says that after he got off the call with Aer Lingus he remembered that when he had requested the voucher in March the visa restrictions were in place in the USA, “so even if I went up to the Aer Lingus desk to take the flight I would not have been be able to due to the visa restrictions. I know it is outside Aer Lingus’s control that the visa situation changed, but it is fundamental to being able to take the flight. Do you think I am entitled to my money back or do I just have to wait for the voucher? “We do know the answer to this question but it won’t make for happy reading for David or any other reader in a similar position. The bottom line, as it has become all too clear in recent months, is that airlines are only responsible for ferrying people from A to B. They have no role in ensuring passengers are actually permitted to travel or have the requisite visa or paperwork in place other than to not let them board in the absence of those visas or passports. It is, ultimately, the passenger’s responsibility to ensure everything is in order before they show up at the boarding gate. So, even though US rules have prohibited Irish citizens from entering the US in recent months, Aer Lingus – and indeed all other airlines – were able to wash their hands of the problem. If they flew the planes and people were not able to board, they were viewed as no-shows. Aer Lingus actually deserves a bit of credit – not something we have said often in recent times – because it could simply have regarded this reader as a no-show and refused to offer him anything by way of comfort. The long and the short of it is the voucher is probably the best he can hope for, and the good news – if we can call it that – is that the voucher has an expiry limit of five years. Ferry tale with no happy ever after“I’d to draw your attention to my experience with Brittany Ferries. It is not just the airlines that are proving difficult to deal with at the current time,” a mail from Trevor Sheahan begins ominously. “I had a booking to travel with my family on the Cork-Roscoff ferry on the second weekend of July. I had paid a 50 per cent deposit and was due to pay the second instalment by May 12th.”Three days before then he sent a message to the company that he would not be travelling based on the advice of government and requesting that the final payment on the reservation not be taken.“I received a response from a named representative on May 11th that the final payment would not be taken and that my card details were being deleted. I was satisfied with this as I understood (and still believe) that this constituted an acceptance of my request,” he continues.Then on June 5th he received an email from Brittany Ferries to say that they were having trouble collecting the second portion of the ticket price. “As I had already received a written reply acceding to my earlier request I considered the issue dealt with in respect of the booking. I didn’t read the email in detail as I considered it didn’t apply to me. There was a line at the bottom of the email to which I will return to later,” he says. Then, on June 30th, he contacted Brittany Ferries by email to enquire about options such as vouchers for the money already paid, since the Government advice was still not to travel abroad unless necessary. “I received, that afternoon, an email with a ‘cancellation invoice’ attached. The cancellation fee being the full sum of the initial deposit paid – €591. I immediately responded stating that I had not requested a cancellation, and requested that the cancellation be reversed and my request re vouchers be addressed.”A day later he received a reply which stated that he had been contacted on June 5th to say payment was due and that, as he had not made the payment, his booking had been cancelled and his deposit forfeit. He was also told there was no entitlement to any voucher.“I then read the email of June 5th in detail. This mail requested payment of the outstanding balance and a confirmation from me that I still wished to travel. At the bottom of the email was a line stating that if payment was not received by 8th June, then they would consider that I did not wish to travel with them and they would cancel the booking. As I had already told Brittany Ferries on May 9th that I would not be travelling, that I did not wish to pay the second portion of the ticket price and as they had acceded to that request, it is still clear to me that this email was not relevant to me. When I contacted Brittany Ferries on June 30th, it was still open to me to make a change to my travel arrangements as per the terms and conditions of my original booking, given that this booking was still live when I sent the mail.”He replied to the mail telling his story. “I also suggested that from a commercial perspective it made sense to issue me with vouchers as this would require me to spend more money in order to secure a booking for my family and that I was prepared to make such a booking immediately for 2021. In the middle of last month he was told that it was impossible for Brittany Ferries to accommodate his request as he had not responded to the June 5th mails and as such the booking was auto cancelled on June 30th.He says he does have insurance “and so I will not suffer any significant financial loss as a result of this episode. However, I live in Cork and as I would never consider Brittany Ferries again, now I will need to travel to Rosslare or Dublin if I wish to take a ferry.”We contacted the ferry company but it had nothing by way of comfort for our reader and appeared unconcerned by his determination never to use its services again. This is the statement we received in full. “For the selected ticket type, we clearly outline that a deposit of 50 per cent of the price is payable upon booking, with the balance due 60 days before travel. The booking terms \u0026amp conditions also clearly outline that if the balance on a booking isn’t paid by this time, then the booking will be cancelled and the relevant cancellations charges outlined in our terms and conditions will be applied. “We have been very clear with our customers as to the different options available to them if they choose not to avail of sailings that are still going ahead. When payment of the balance was not received by the date advised, the booking at this point was no longer live in the system. Our customer service teams have been dealing with thousands of bookings and at all times we advise our customers to carefully read all correspondence.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324665.1596812440!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tobar na cuimhne","story":"Ní foláir nó gur mhór an éachtaint dá lán na pictiúir sin dubh agus bán ar mháirseálacha, ar mhórshiúlta, ar ruathair na bpéas, ar urchair ruibéir Arm na Breataine, go deimhin, ar éilimh chomh réasúnta sin go rachadh de dhuine ar bith a thuiscint cad ar a shon nach nglacfaí leo.

There was also an additional employee who worked between two rooms.“Because of this, I took the decision to also close that room immediately. This employee proved negative but another staff member in this pod of seven children was a confirmed case.“Both cases showed very mild symptoms and didn’t need any hospital treatment and neither staff members had any contact with each other either in work or outside it.“Six rooms at the facility remain open.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Authorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4325971.1596993759!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ecuador navy tracks huge chinese fishing fleet near galapagos","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEcuador’s navy has approached Colombia and Peru to share information and seek a regional response to the vessels. Photograph: ReutersEcuador’s navy is conducting surveillance of a massive Chinese fishing fleet that is operating near the protected waters of the Galapagos Islands, amid concerns about the environmental impact of fishing in the area of the ecologically sensitive islands.The navy conducted a patrol mission on Friday that included a flyover of the region where the hulking vessels are fishing, as well as reconnaissance by military patrol ships. A total of 340 vessels are in the area, the navy said, compared with some 260 reported last month.Images taken as part of the flyover, which included journalists, showed that at least one of the vessels appeared to be ageing and in need of maintenance.Ecuador’s navy commander, rear admiral Darwin Jarrin, said the navy has approached Colombia and Peru to share information and seek a regional response to the vessels, most of which can hold up to 1,000 tonnes of catch.The fleet generally spends several weeks fishing off the coast of Peru before approaching the Galapagos. The fishing fleet has since 2017 been arriving in the summer months and fishing just outside the Galapagos territorial waters, drawn by marine species such as the endangered hammerhead shark.Such fishing is not illegal because it takes place in international waters. But environmental activists say it allows fleets to take advantage of the abundant marine species that spill over from the Galapagos and cross into the unprotected waters.“This is not something that will change overnight,” said Ecuadorean foreign minister Luis Gallegos in a television interview on Sunday. “It is necessary to . . . generate bilateral agreements with other countries with regards to illegal fishing, to monitor every ship that’s in the South Pacific.”‘Zero tolerance’A Chinese vessel in 2017 was captured in the Galapagos Marine Reserve carrying 300 tons of marine wildlife.China has promised a “zero tolerance” approach to illegal fishing and has proposed a moratorium on fishing in the area between September and November. The fishing fleets usually leave the area before that period.The Galapagos Islands, which lie some 1,000 km (620 miles) from Ecuador’s coast, are home to many unique species, including giant tortoises, and served as inspiration for 19th century British scientist Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4325002.1596827530!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british cash for northern ireland shows scale of brexit disruption","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish cabinet office minister Michael Gove visited the Ulster Carpets factory in Co Armagh on Friday in the course of his visit to Northern Ireland. Photograph: Press EyePA WireAn announcement of £650 million in funding for Northern Ireland was proclaimed by the British government as a “major . . . investment” and statement of London’s “commitment” to the people and businesses there. But dig into the numbers and the spin is apparent.Of the headline figure, £300 million is peace funding that had already been pledged back in January 2019, to continue joint projects with the European Union.The rest is spending on new import procedures for goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain and the rest of the non-EU world that is only necessary due to Brexit. It could therefore be presented as a cost to the taxpayer rather than a bonus.Beneath the rather disingenuous packaging, there is some substance that industry figures in the North have welcomed – though with caveats.In all, £200 million is dedicated to setting up and running for two years a trader support service, which is essentially designed to take care of import procedures and their associated costs that businesses would otherwise have to shoulder themselves.What happens after the two years and the £200 million ends is currently uncertain, but British sources insisted it was intended as an ongoing commitment.The remainder of the money is for the IT systems that would support the service “to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined”, according to the British government.The trader support service does not cover everything. It does not include import VAT obligations, and would not cover the most onerous kind of check, the sanitary and phytosanitary controls that are required to prevent any threats to plant, animal or human health from goods of plant or animal origin.It also does not cover export health certificates, required to export animals or animal products from Britain into the North or the EU from January. It’s for businesses only, so it does not include sales of goods from Britain to private iniduals in Northern Ireland, such as through online shopping.There are also numerous things that are yet to be settled. Whether or not businesses will be faced with the onerous tariff schedule of the World Trade Organisation on trade with Britain depends on if a deal can be reached on time.ExemptionBritain is hoping to get the EU to agree to an exemption for major supermarket chains in Northern Ireland from the need to comply with the sea border checks, arguing that such big companies can be trusted to keep goods from leaking into the Republic, and easily caught if they were not.Northern Ireland is the poorest part of the UK any step to avoid additional costs being passed on to consumers who cannot afford them is positive.The issue raises the question of whether the Irish Government’s arrangements will be equivalent in alleviating costs for businesses in the Republic.Any uneven situation between north and south creates incentives for smuggling and bad actors, and competition to businesses that do everything above board.Customs formalities will apply on all goods entering the whole island from Britain as of January, whether a deal is signed or not.In addition, all traders with Britain will need an economic operators registration and identification number issued by the EU.The figure of £200 million for two years indicates the scale of cost that also faces businesses in the Republic from January, without the daunting prospect of tariffs if no deal is reached on top.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: EPATony VrailasHidden behind the tragedy of Tuesday’s deadly explosion in Beirut is the more pervasive travesty of the abandonment of ships, seafarers and cargo, and unless the global public reckons with this deeper problem a next disaster is all but inevitable.While Lebanese investigators say that nearby fireworks likely ignited the 2,750 tons of explosive ammonium-nitrate, the true causes of this explosion stem from slower-moving and less dramatic factors: anaemic enforcement by shady flag registries that are supposed to hold shipowners accountable, tightened immigration controls that routinely trap stranded crews on decrepit ships, lax rules and a maritime bureaucracy designed more to protect anonymity and secrecy of ship owners than to enable oversight and transparency of the industry.These are the factors that make it so easy for vessel owners and operators to walk away from their responsibilities usually with impunity, and sometimes with life-or-death consequences for the crew that gets left behind.The broader story begins on the barely-seaworthy, Russian-owned ship flagged to Moldova called the Rhosus that in 2013 was transporting tons of the volatile and odourless crystalline substance when Lebanese port authorities deemed the vessel unsafe to continue its journey.Refusing to answer urgent calls from the crew or port authorities, the ship’s owner, a Russian man named Igor Grechushkin, was soon confronted with heavy fines, including roughly $100,000 in back wages and port fees. In response Grechushkin did what many shipowners do. He cut his losses, declared bankruptcy, and quietly disappeared, abandoning his workers, the dilapidated ship and its deadly cargo.That Grechushkin could disavow his duties so easily is a consequence of the labyrinthine elements of maritime law and administration, and the distinctly transient and trans-national nature of the industry. Lebanese authorities were hard pressed to arrest Grechushkin or seize his property since he lived not in Lebanon but in Cyprus, and his shipping company, Teto Shipping Ltd, was registered on the Marshall Islands.No moneyMeanwhile, the men left onboard the Rhosus found themselves in a bind that is surprisingly common for seafarers around the world. Lacking clean water, fuel, or food, not to mention phone service, legal help or the ability to speak the local language, these men had no money to get home nor even the immigration papers allowing them to disembark.While warning anyone who would listen about the dangers of the Rhosus’s cargo, several of the stranded crew waited a full year before they were able to go home with help from the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), which is the largest global seafarers union.On any given day hundreds of ships and thousands of seafarers are in the same situation. Port officials like those in Beirut have little power to repatriate abandoned crews or ships when they are left behind. Usually cargo gets sent to its rightful owner because it travels with insurance, but the men who work on board are rarely as lucky.A database created by the ITF and international labour section of the UN indicates that nearly 5,000 seafarers were abandoned on their vessels in nearly 400 separate incidents between 2004 and 2018. Over the past six years while reporting on crimes at sea, I’ve stumbled across hundreds of these dire predicaments.Take for instance the 16 men stuck on the Zoya 1, a supertanker that in April 2018 had been trapped off the coast of the UAE for more than a year and were owed more than four months’ salary. Languishing on board a ship overrun with vermin, the men slowly fell apart, physically and mentally. Unable to disembark, several of the men who were unable to swim tried to take their own lives by jumping overboard. In a photo taken at the time, crew members held signs that said, “We are helpless. We did not commit any crime.” The crew was repatriated in June 2018.Covid-19 has made matters worse, stranding roughly 400,000 mariners at sea and in ports. “The ITF has been receiving emails from hundreds of seafarers daily, expressing their concern about contracts being extended under duress,” said Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the ITF.In the port of Beirut, for example, not far from the warehouse that exploded, an oil tanker called the Captain Nagdaliyev was abandoned with 13 seafarers on board. Stuck for nearly a year, these men have been without wages, water or food, and they barely escaped with their lives when the warehouse blew apart sections of their ship.Even when crews make it home, their cargo presents risks. Case in point: the full oil tanker called the FSO Safer, which was abandoned in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes last year along the coast of Yemen. Hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, this floating bomb could cause massive environmental damage, impede marine traffic and kill hundreds, according to marine safety experts.Similarly, environmentalists and union officials have warned of a possible disaster tied to an abandoned ship 21km off the coast of the Philippines in Manila Bay. A crew of 15 have been stuck on the Spanish tanker MV Celanova since February 2nd. Loaded with liquid petroleum gas, the tanker lacks enough fuel to keep the cargo refrigerated and port officials warn there is imminent risk of fire.Strict rulesInternationally there are strict rules mandating that ammonium-nitrate should not be stored near fuels or sources of heat. In the US regulations over ammonium-nitrate were tightened significantly after the Oklahoma City bombing of a federal building in which 168 people died.There is no shortage of blame to share for what happened in Beirut. Local corruption and ineptitude within the Lebanese government likely played a role. Customs authorities repeatedly tried to get permission from local judges to allow them to seize so they could export the ammonium-nitrate or to hand it over to the Lebanese army rather than store it dangerously in the port warehouse. Their urgent letters went unanswered for years.Port officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarers partly because of the opaque way that the shipping industry polices itself. For centuries the world’s merchant fleets flew the flag of the country of their home port. That country was responsible for ensuring the proper treatment of the crew and safety of the vessel. This began to change in the early 20th century with the emergence of “open registries”, also called “flags of convenience”.The company collecting fees for the right to fly a certain flag is also responsible for policing its customers, ensuring they abide by safety, labour, and environmental rules, and conducting investigations when things go wrong. But in practice flags of convenience create a perverse incentive for ship operators to shop around for the most lax registries with the lowest prices and fewest regulations.The Rhosus, for instance, was flagged to Moldova, which at least since 2013 has been on a black list that is run by Paris MoU, an international naval organisation that monitors and regulates maritime traffic in European waters. The organisation labelled Moldovan-flagged ships as “medium to high risk” due to the number of times their ships have been inspected or detained in the past three years.Crimes of neglectThe media is also complicit. Dramatic disasters such as the deadly Beirut explosion reflect acute problems and typically grab press attention. Slow-motion tragedies and bureaucratic crimes of neglect such as those that preceded the Beirut explosion rarely get covered, even though the ruinous impact is often as severe.When abandoned seafarers do make it home they usually face crushing debt due to the unpaid wages and the money they borrowed to get this job at sea. Their maritime licences expired, they are often also blacklisted by the local employment agencies that control access to jobs.In 2017, partly motivated by bad press and union pressure, the shipping industry came together in an unprecedented fashion and tried to confront the tendency to abandon seafarers. The industry imposed a new rule requiring shipowners to carry insurance to cover the costs of sailors marooned in port. Unfortunately most of the smaller and older vessels that are most likely to strand mariners are not, under this new rule, the ones required to carry such insurance.Ian Urbina, a former investigative reporter for the New York Times, is the director of the Outlaw Ocean Project, a non-profit journalism organisation based in Washington DC that focuses on reporting about environmental and human rights crimes at seaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"rather sound like minnie mouse helium have rp accent","story":"In my young life, I wanted to change quite a few things about myself. I was a blonde who wanted to be a brunette. I was a West Country schoolgirl who wanted to be a famous writer. I’ve achieved them all with some level of success. But one thing I’ve never wanted to do was change my voice. If you’ve ever heard me speak (look me up on Desert Island Discs if you haven’t) you might find this peculiar. I do not, to put it mildly, have a voice much found in public life. It’s been compared to a rustic child (though I come from Bristol, a big city, everyone talks like a farmer there), Minnie Mouse on helium and – my favourite – an evil toy cat.There’s a tradition of humbly-born media women changing their accents, from Joan Bakewell to Caitlin Moran. It’s creepy how men aren’t expected to do so to the same extent as some wit (me) once said “Men are the sum of their parts whereas women are some of their parts.” But not me – I love my voice. I never get upset about what people say about me but one of the few times I’ve been livid and thought seriously about suing was when Will Self wrote of me some years back: “Burchill is meant to have a complex about her girlish voice and her Wurzelesque accent, but while we were chatting it dropped at least an octave and regional began to slide towards received.”Despising it as I do as the mark of either the upper-class boor or the lower-class castrate, I was surprised that Received Pronunciation was voted the most attractive accent this week in a survey by the online dating website eharmony. Respondents were asked to listen to a sentence read by speakers with twenty varying accents and rate each on how much they associated them with ten different character traits.Received Pronunciation was found to be strongly associated with intelligence, sophistication and charm – really, has no one been following the recent trajectories of Princes Andrew and Harry, and of every other over-privileged clown who frequently has to extract the plum in his mouth in order to fit his foot in?Equally bafflingly it was followed by the New Zealand accent two places above the Australian accent – is there a difference? (My NZ friend says yes: “We laugh in the bath, they lef in the bef. We say six six six is the number of the beast they say it’s a night-long roll in the hay.”) Or has the plague made those who live in the wide open spaces of New Zealand seem suddenly desirable?Similarly, I can’t help thinking that three of the worst four accents are influenced by current affairs. Images of Cornish natives daubing rude graffiti telling unwanted tourists to go home have obliterated the swashbuckling sex appeal of Poldark.While French and Spanish accents being only slightly less loathed is surely a Brexit thing once considered the most seductive of tongues, we now associate them with pen-pushing spoil-sports telling us we can’t have bendy bananas.I’m not a normal person by any means and my taste in accents is predictably off-message. I like some conventionally attractive lilts, such as Welsh and Geordie, but also Brummie, apparently the fourth most loathed. I’m not alone a bar in Tel Aviv advertised for staff in a Birmingham local newspaper awhile back.I like all the accents one isn’t meant to – the Mancunian and the Scouser and the guttural Northern Irish. I suppose I like the accents I think of as working-class if they aren’t, that means the speaker had privilege and therefore can never be a truly self-made success, and thus is not a first-rate person in my invertedly snobbish eyes. Brutal, but true.And as a Brexiteer, I’m keen on voices that sound like they come from Somewhere the bourgeoise of Bristol or Brighton tend to sound just the same as they do in Barnes. Until we hear Radio 4 newsreaders with Bristolian and Brummie accents, the BBC’s drive for more regional voices will remain a bastion of empty-headed virtue-signalling. As they pursue the admirable goal of racial ersity, they should be promoting the voices of the working class, too.“Nation shall speak peace unto nation” – but only if you can dumb down to RP.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists spat whether infect people coronavirus vaccine trials","story":"Scientists working on Britain’s best hope for a coronavirus vaccine are understood to be at odds about whether to deliberately infect healthy patients in order to test it.Professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University, wants to recruit young volunteers for such tests in the hope it will speed up the race for a successful jab.He is among hundreds of scientists advocating the use of “human challenge trials” which would see healthy people under the age of 30 deliberately infected in order to test the jab.But Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the institute, is understood to have clashed with him over his intentions, believing the risk to volunteers is too high.Their dilemma is whether to expose volunteers to the virus, which could mean a successful vaccine becomes available more quickly – or wait until any potential long-term effects are better understood. Prof Hill is part of the research team working on a vaccine, and in July said he would like to see trials which test the jab on those who have been deliberately infected with the virus occurring by the end of this year.“Everybody would agree that the risk is extremely low in young people,” he said.However, Prof Gilbert told BBC Radio 4: “It\u0027s not something that\u0027s going to happen in the short term” – with the Mail on Sunday reporting a source saying the two scientists are “not particularly happy” with each other at the moment. In a statement, the Jenner Institute said: “We are not planning to test the Oxford vaccine in challenge models at the present time.”Earlier this year, Prof Gilbert told the House of Lords science and technology committee that the success of lockdown in cutting transmission of coronavirus was making it far more difficult to develop a vaccine. She told peers that the UK study had “little chance, frankly, of determining efficacy” with researchers seeking to work with multiple countries in order to test it in places where the virus was more common. The Oxford team is already running a trial in Brazil because the numbers of transmissions are much higher than in the UK.Meanwhile, Downing Street has been advised that there is a 50 per cent chance that a vaccine could be administered by next year, but that it is unlikely to give complete protection against the virus.Instead, the Oxford University team expect the jab to “mitigate” its worst effects by lessening the severity of the symptoms. Trials found two thirds of recipients developed headaches and a fifth developed a high temperature, it is understood.In July, Prof Hill announced that initial trials on 1,077 British adults showed the Oxford vaccine induced strong antibody and T-cell responses, potentially offering a “double defence” against coronavirus. Antibodies can repel the virus, while T-cells, a type of white blood cell, help to target infected cells.During the trials, 90 per cent of the recipients were shown to have developed neutralising antibodies after one dose of the vaccine, prompting Ministers to order 190 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, of which 100 million are the Oxford version.Also in July, Prof Hill said he had been working with a US campaign group called \u00271 Day Sooner\u0027 to secure medical-grade doses of Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19, which would be required for the human challenge trials. The group is made up of more than 30,000 would-be volunteers in 140 countries who say they are prepared to take part in challenge studies.A spokesman for Oxford University said: “We are not planning to test the Oxford vaccine in challenge models at the present time as we have extensive international clinical trials to evaluate the Oxford vaccine in a real world setting. Challenge studies could be very helpful in understanding the biology of the disease, and better understanding immunity after infection, if they can be conducted safely – and groundwork to think about how these studies could be conducted safely would be helpful for any future studies.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off

Premium.Estimated one\u0026nbspmillion visually impaired\u0026nbsppeople in UK are thought to experience bizarre ultra-lifelike hallucinations - including spiders crawling from books and Victorian families appearing in crowdsThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The first time Dr Amit Patel saw the girl in his home he was so astonished he fell down the stairs.“She was so vivid,” he remembers today. “I could see the detail on her dress. There was blood smeared on her face.”A month earlier, in November 2012, the former A\u0026ampE medic had gone suddenly blind after catastrophic haemorrhaging in both eyes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs he attempted to negotiate a world without sight, the girl – or rather a crystal-clear vision of one white dress, black hair, bloodied and bruised – appeared without warning. And she has been doing so ever since.“I can be working, walking down the street, with the kids, and she’ll suddenly be there,” the 40-year-old father-of-two says. “She once watched me change my daughter’s nappy. She’s always on trains.”This is Charles Bonnet Syndrome – and an estimated one million partially sighted and blind people in the UK are believed to live with it.National tracing system ‘hampering’ Covid fight in Greater ManchesterThey see – often on a near daily basis – intensely real, hyper-detailed visions. Sometimes these are benign: flowers sprouting, musical notes hanging in the air or rainbows forming.But for many – for reasons which nobody understands – the scenes come tinged with horror. Tarantulas crawl out of books, gargoyles appear amid friends, zombies turn up in homes. In an online post, one UK sufferer, describes seeing a person crumble to dust in front of them. Dr Patel likens his visitor to the girl in The Ring. “Used to love that film,” he says today. Now, he’s less enamoured.“Something I hear a lot is it’s like being inside a horror movie,” says Judith Potts, founder of Esme’s Umbrella, the UK’s only charity dedicated to the condition. “People know it’s not real but they can’t switch it off. There is no cure. They cannot escape.”It is something researchers now hope to begin putting right.A major study being carried out by neuroscientists at the University of Oxford will this summer begin investigating what might cause CBS. In doing so, they hope to, firstly, destigmatise an illness which many are believed to suffer with silently for fear their sanity may be questioned, and, secondly, lay the groundwork for finding an eventual treatment.Crucially, while it has long been established that the syndrome is to do with the eye’s interaction with the brain – as opposed to being a form of psychosis or dementia – the research will aim to establish what exactly is happening within that process.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If you wake up in a morning and see a tiger in your doorway that’s so real you can see the saliva on its teeth – that’s just one example of someone I spoke to recently – if you see that, it is so terrifying that, even though you know it’s not real, the anxiety puts huge stress on your life.“Some people won’t go out as much because they don’t want to have these visions in public, or they become depressed. They have accidents. You can imagine it’s rather distracting suddenly being confronted by a Victorian family as you walk down the street.”She herself founded Esme’s Umbrella in 2015 because her mother – the Esme in question – had suffered with the condition but found nowhere to turn: “A wonderful lucid woman who did the cryptic crossword everyday but who also happened to see gargoyles jumping around her kitchen,” notes Potts.Charles Bonnet Syndrome itself was first identified in 1760 by the Swiss naturalist and philosopher whose grandfather – a sane and cogent man – confided in his grandson that he had started seeing birds he knew could not possibly be there.Yet, perhaps, because the condition appears to cause no apparent physical or mental deterioration, research has been sparse and wider knowledge of it remains hugely limited.Despite estimates that half of all visually impaired people in the UK suffer – a figure put forward by the King’s College London neuroscientist Dr Dominic Ffytche – most have never heard of it until they are diagnosed. It was only four years ago, indeed, that the Royal College of Ophthalmologists started advising its doctors they should ask patients as a matter of routine if they experienced hallucinations in a bid to better understand the syndrome.The fact the visions are so often characterised by something vaguely dreadful is, one expert told The Independent, “beyond the current limit” of scientific understanding.Stress, isolation and anxiety may spark the visions, some believe. But even this is open to interpretation – because the visions probably increase stress and anxiety levels.“The first time it happened I thought I was losing my mind,” says Arthur Anston, a 71-year-old retired sales director, as he describes an unknown person suddenly appearing as he travelled in a car with his wife.“They started very modern-looking, then their appearance went back in time – Victorian, Roman – until I had a prehistoric man looking at me,” he adds.So scared was he that his son-in-law immediately took him to hospital. “No one ever told me when I started losing my sight this might happen,” the grandfather-of-two from Manchester says. “I’d never heard of CBS. All I knew was I was seeing something that no one else was. It was disturbing.”It is a word commonly used by many of those diagnosed with the condition.Schools facing tsunami of childhood grief in wake of coronavirusFor Nina Chesworth, the first time she saw visions was just days after suffering the trauma of losing her sight during a home accident in 2018. Kaleidoscopic rainbows and coloured patterns suddenly appeared as she lay in hospital, eventually progressing, over the next few weeks, into unicorns.“I’m a graphic designer by training,” the 38-year-old mother-of-one says. “So, I was a bit like, ‘Well, this is interesting’. I would observe all these colours and patterns. I found them comforting in a way. I still do sometimes.”At one point she saw Danger Mouse. “I loved Danger Mouse,” she says. “That was lovely.”Then, however, came the zombies and snarling dogs.“I was sat on the sofa at home the first time,” the mother-of-one from Manchester recalls. “I was too scared to move for hours. It’s not like you can shut your eyes and stop seeing it. It stays right there in front of you.”Now she has got used to the strange mix of visitors she is less concerned – “sometimes I sit studying them” – but they have caused her accidents, led to plans being cancelled and can make the world feel overwhelming.“As a blind person you rely on all your other senses but when the visions start, they can take over,” she says. “They are incapacitating, even when it’s not bad stuff you’re seeing.”It is for this exact reason that Esme’s Unbrella and the Fight For Sight charity are now funding the new research.Pertinently, with 4 million people in the UK set to have some form of visual impairment by 2050 – a number which would result in a possible 2 million people with CBS – experts say it is more crucial than ever to get a grip on the syndrome.“So much more needs to be done to understand this,” says Sherine Krause, chief executive of Fight For Sight. “With a better understanding of the causes, we will be one step closer to developing a treatment and a cure.”The study will see some 20 people – 10 with CBS and 10 without – have certain chemicals in their brains measured and monitored over a period of time.“By looking at that, we can see if there may be an imbalance in chemistry in the visional system that may be a cause of these really weird visions,” says Holly Bridge, a professor of neuroscience leading the study. “If we can establish that, then it can become a possible lead to treatment because you could look to develop ways of changing those chemical balances. In the very long term, it may well be that you could develop an appropriate drug to keep those chemical levels in proportion.”Early results will come within 12 months and a fully published paper within 18 – but a treatment, of course, might not arrive for years. All the same, back with Amit in London – flanked by trusty guide dog Kika – he longs for the day when the girl from The Ring is no longer a regular visitor. He would not, it is safe to say, miss her.“I was thinking the other day,” he says, “she’s been in my life longer than my children. It would be nice now to be rid of her.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As warnings of a second wave of coronavirus loom, obese people are among vulnerable groups who may be instructed to stay at home this autumn, it has been reported.The government is said to be mulling over a “more sophisticated model” for shielding, in preparation for winter and to avoid another national lockdown. Part of the plan is to employ a “stiletto not a sledgehammer” approach by pinpointing people who are especially vulnerable to the virus and telling them to remain indoors, a cabinet minister told The Sunday .The newspaper revealed that officials are analysing NHS data on vulnerable groups, such as those who are obese and over the age of 50, in preparation for a possible second wave.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA cabinet minister was quoted as saying: “They are understanding that age does come into it. The shielding cohort is way too broad. You can’t say that every fat person has to shield – it will be more subtle.”At the start of August, millions of people who were told to shield at the start of the lockdown were able to leave their homes for the first time in four months.Elderly people are already self-isolating.

Preston is the latest area to impose tougher measures.The news that obese people may be told to self-isolate follows the launch of the government’s new anti-obesity campaign to get the nation fit and healthy, and to help people protect themselves against the coronavirus.The “Better Health” campaign is designed to tackle obesity and help people lose weight. Recent figures showed that about two-thirds (63 per cent) of adults in England are overweight or obese, and one in three children leave primary school overweight or obese.Boris Johnson, who himself is overweight and became ill with Covid-19 in April, led the charge in launching the campaign. He said: “Losing weight is hard, but with some small changes, we can all feel fitter and healthier.“If we all do our bit, we can reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus – as well as taking pressure off the NHS.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The Home Office spent more than £1m on deporting hundreds of people at the height of the lockdown, despite government instructions warning against all non-essential travel, The Independent can reveal.New figures show 285 iniduals were removed to Albania, Romania, Lithuania and Poland on seven charter flights between 1 April and 30 June 2020, along with 374 escorts, at a cost to the taxpayer of £1,105,931.One of the deportees was a Polish woman who had lived in the UK for 10 years and was removed on the basis of a shoplifting conviction for which she spent six months in jail, forcing her to leave her 11-year-old son behind.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe data, obtained through a freedom of information request by campaign group No Deportations, show there were three flights chartered to Romania, two to Albania and one to both Poland and Lithuania. The deportees were made up of 268 men and 17 women.They departed from the UK at a time when the government had issued stay-at-home instructions stating that people should not fly unless it was essential, and when international air travel had dropped by 95 per cent.Home Office restarts removals of asylum seekers despite Covid-19 fearsGovernment ‘too slow’ to rescue Brits stranded by pandemic – reportHome Office charters new deportation flight despite Covid-19 warningThe Independent understands that no Covid-19 testing was undertaken for those on the flights. The Home Office said those being returned were seen by a healthcare professional prior to departure, and that anyone exhibiting symptoms would be removed from the flight and placed into protective isolation.Labour MP Diane Abbott said the fact that the government was deporting people in the middle of a global pandemic was a “scandal”, adding: “It seems that maintaining draconian immigration practices was more important to the government than public health.”Celia Clarke, director of Bail for Immigration Detainees, said: “At a time when we were all urged to stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS, the Home Office quietly continued to detain and remove people.”She said the sums involved were “staggering”, pointing out that it was in addition to the £8.2m paid out in the last year in compensation to people detained unlawfully.The new figures will prompt further anger when considered alongside the alleged failure by the UK government to charter a sufficient number of flights to repatriate Britons stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We only remove people when it is safe to do so and public health guidance is adhered to on all removal flights.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Baroness Lawrence, Sir Keir Starmer’s race relations adviser, pointed to new analysis by Labour which suggests that inner city areas with much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations have among the highest rates of furloughed staff. Workers in these areas could be at a higher risk of redundancy later this year, the party warns. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from the House of Commons library shows that nine of the sixteen parliamentary constituencies with the highest take-up rate of the furlough scheme also have much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations.  They include Tottenham, in London, where the figures show half of the population is from a Bame community and 39 per cent of those eligible have been furloughed. Baroness Lawrence said: “This pandemic has already had a disproportionate impact on the health of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in this country, and now there is mounting evidence that they will be hit hardest by the economic impact too. “The government must support black, Asian and ethnic minority communities by introducing a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors. “If we are going to effectively address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 we must eradicate the systemic inequalities that it thrives on.”  In April Sir Keir appointed Baroness Lawrence as his race relations adviser and asked her to lead a review into the effect of the coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. The Labour peer, whose son Stephen Lawrence was killed as he waited at a bus stop in 1993, is expected to publish her report later this year.

We’ve been quite transparent about it.”European Research Group ‘corruption of Conservatism’ says senior ToryThe controversy comes after the government said companies will be able to import 260,000 tonnes of raw sugar cane from anywhere in the world, tariff-free, from January.However, the only company that currently imports raw sugar cane is Tate \u0026amp Lyle – one of the few large employers that publicly backed Brexit.Its name was also carried on the lanyards worn by everyone who attended the 2017 Tory conference, a sponsorship is recorded as an £8,000 donation by the Electoral Commission.The new tariff-free quota equates to a £72.8m saving, according to analysis by Greenpeace’s Unearthed investigations team.Created with Sketch.Brexit timeline: How did we get here?

In Minsk, there were reports of barricades, water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets being used against protestors. In one instance, a police van drove into crowds. In other cities across the country, officers reportedly laid down arms and crossed to the side of protesters. The unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 6.8 per cent assigned to her by the official poll, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. I want to ask them to remember that they are part of the nation too, she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHours before voting ended, Belarus had all but declared a state of emergency. Footage of soldiers and military equipment entering the capital was widely shared by locals, who appeared both excited and spooked by serious prospects in this usually pacific backwater. By 6pm local time (4pm BST), most of the capital Minsk’s central squares and government buildings had been cordoned off. Transport systems were shut down. Roads in and out of the capital were also closed. The regime’s obvious nervousness extended to efforts to control the internet. Major disruptions to mobile networks were reported from the morning, with connections practically grinding to a halt at around 10pm local time. Proxy servers, used widely in these parts to get around censorship, became unreliable.Belarus’s upcoming election spells out two very different futuresUnidentified forces want ‘massacre’ in Belarus, says LukashenkoBelarus charges opposition politicians with assisting Russian plotJournalists and other independent observers appeared to be a target. At around 2pm local time (4pm BST), three reporters from the Russian liberal outlet TV Dozhd were handcuffed, held to the ground, and arrested. Just before midnight, AP photographer Mstyslav Chernov was hospitalised with suspected concussion after being beaten by riot police while inside a police van. Sunday’s events came at the end of an unexpectedly panicked campaign for Belarus’s longtime leader — one that saw opposition candidates jailed, protesters snatched from the streets, the president claim a scarcely believable Russian-backed plot, and where the opposition candidate was forced into hiding on the eve of voting.Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, was never supposed to mount a serious challenge, only entering the race after President Lukahshenko jailed her husband, and presidential hopeful Sergei Tikhanovsky. Famously dismissive of women in politics, Mr Lukashenko seemed to believe the housewife and former translator didn\u0027t have a chance. But her invigorating, earnest campaign surprised Belarus and it wrong-footed Mr Lukashenko.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFew expected Ms Tikhanovskaya to reach an agreement with the campaign teams of other banned opposition candidates — but she reportedly did so in just 15 minutes. Few believed she could lead a clear campaign — but she did so with simple promises to deliver fresh elections, walk back authoritarian changes to the constitution, and free political prisoners.Flanked by Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of Valery Tsepkalo, another barred candidate, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign manager for jailed Viktor Barbariko, Ms Tikhanovskaya’s opposition campaign took on unmistakably feminist, modern slant. It also brought over 200,000 people to the streets in support — an astonishing moment for Belarus, a police state of just 9 million people, and where dissent often leads to jail.Underestimating Ms Tikhanovskaya was only not the only mistake the usually clever and adroit Mr Lukashenko made in the run up to the elections. His electoral rating was hit hard by a perceived cavalier approach to the Covid-19 epidemic (he claimed the virus was avoidable with vodka, trips to the sauna and work in the field.) His management of the country’s increasingly desperate economic position — and its rapidly unwinding model of Soviet planning with Russian subsidies — also provoked much anger. The extraordinary campaign to unseat Belarusian ‘dictator’ LukashenkoGiven the fact independent polling is illegal in Belarus, it was never entirely clear quite how vulnerable “Europe’s last dictator” became to Ms Tikanovskaya’s challenge. But unprecedented numbers of voters appeared to answer Ms Tikhanovskaya\u0027s call to vote late on Sunday, with lines of voters stretching back for kilometres in some districts. The head of the election\u0027s committee, a key Lukashenko ally and chief vote counter, described the queues as provocations by the opposition. Earlier, she described the opposition as a totalitarian sect.Results in some Minsk constituencies appeared to support the opposition claim that Ms Tikhanovskaya won convincingly.Independent exit poll conducted outside polling stations in foreign embassies also painted a different picture to the official figures. According to this poll, Mr Lukashenko received just 6.25 per cent, compared to Ms Tikhanovskaya with 79.69 per cent. Ahead of the end of voting today, Mr Luksahenko said his rivals weren’t even “worthy of repression.” But he seemed to make ominous warnings for those intending to protest. “All our structures and special services are ready and waiting,” he said. “There is no reason for our country to be plunged into chaos or civil war.

Protesters also broke into the housing and transport ministry offices.“We gave these leaders so many chances to help us and they always failed,” Walid Jamal, an unemployed demonstrator, said.The numbers of those out on the street was considerably less than Saturday’s demonstration, which saw thousands attend. Anger against the government mounted after reports suggested that officials knew about the 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate for several years, but failed to take action. But even before the blast, Lebanon had been rocked by mass rallies against the government decried as corrupt and culpable for the worst financial crisis to hit the country in decades.

The emergency aid will focus on medicine and hospitals, schools, food and housing.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who hosted the conference, said in his opening remarks that the UN in Lebanon should coordinate the international response to the disaster which devastated Beirut.“Our task today is to act swiftly and efficiently, to coordinate our aid on the ground so that this aid goes as quickly as possible to the Lebanese people,” Mr Macron said on the video call. “Our role is to be by their sides. Lebanon’s future is at stake,” he added. The French president also said international assistance would include supporting an impartial and independent inquiry into the blast on 4 August.During the conference, which included international leaders and government officials, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister also called for a “transparent and independent investigation” into the explosion.Donald Trump told participants the US was ready to continue providing aid to help the Lebanese, according to the White House. The blast destroyed swathes of the city, leaving more than a quarter of a million people homeless. The economic effects of the incident are expected to be significant, with some economists forecasting that Lebanon’s GDP could fall by as much as 25 per cent as a result. The UK’s international development secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, has pledged another £20m to “stand by the Lebanese people” on Sunday, on top of the £5m the UK has already promised. Lebanon president admits knowing about explosive stockpile weeks agoThe German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced on Sunday that his country would give an extra €10m (£9m) to Lebanon.As part of his statement, Mr Maas said Lebanon had faced “overwhelming challenges” before the explosion, adding that there will be a lot to do “even after the worst of the rubble is removed”. France has offered 18 tonnes of medical aid and 663 tonnes of food, while the US Agency for International Development said it will give $15m (£12m) directly to those who need it most in Beirut, rather than to the Lebanese government.Additional reporting from agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He said: “Where is the evidence  Why has the prosecution not revealed it There won’t be a trial for my client for Madeleine McCann. I am certain.”Meanwhile, top forensic expert Professor Angela Gallop has said Madeleine McCann’s disappearance WILL one day be solved.Professor Gallop, a world-renowned scientist whose work has helped to solve numerous cold cases, said the riddle would finally be solved because “contact always leaves a trace”.Follow our live blog for all the latest news and updates.Phone records that prosecutors say place Christian B near the apartment from which Madeleine McCann vanished dont incriminate him in the case, his lawyer has said. Prosecutors have said that a pre-paid mobile phone owned by Christian B #pinged# a phone mast close to the McCanns apartment around the time Madeleine disappeared. Investigators continue to search for evidence that Christian B was on the -minute call and of who he was talking to. Representing the -year-old, lawyer Friedrich Fulsche said: #You cant say because of the fact that this cell phone was logged to this tower that he was standing near to the apartment of Madeleine MCaCanns disappearance. #He could have been  kilometres away.#Christian B wont ever co-operate with Madeleine McCann investigators, his lawyer has said.Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Friedrich Fulsche said it was not for his client to defend himself, but for prosecutors to establish his guilt.“Before our client starts to co-operate with the prosecutors office, you could order holy water as a long drink in hell,” he said.“That is not unusual. It is very normal not to talk to the police when you are suspected of committing a crime.“The prosecutors office has to prove that a suspect has committed a crime, and not the suspect prove that he hasnt.”Prosecutors in Germany have welcomed a ruling by Europes highest court that has dashed Christian Bs hope of an early release from jail. The -year-old is currently serving a jail term in Germany for the rape of a woman in Portugal in .He stood trial for the crime after being extradited from Italy, and is currently appealing his conviction on the grounds that he was initially extradited to face unrelated drug trafficking charges. The European Court of Justice this week told him the appeal is unlikely to succeed because he left Portugal voluntarily.Speaking to the PA, German prosecutor Julia Meyer said: #The advocate general shares our opinion.#We are pleased and wait for the decision of the court the next few weeks.#German police knew about an allotment previously used by Christian B for two years before searching it, the suspects lawyer has claimed. Investigators last week conducted an excavation of a plot in Hanover and a basement structure beneath.Representing Christian B, Friedrich Fulsche said: “I am very surprised they have started a search there now and not much earlier.“I was very surprised because the police had known for over two years that the garden was used by my client.”He speculated that the timing of the search had been an attempt to sway opinion against Christian B ahead of a then-upcoming ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning his extradition to Germany.Footage shows Christian B behind the wheel of a VW campervan just weeks before Madeleine McCanns disappearance. The -year-old is thought to have been living in a camper in Portugals Praia da Luz around the time Madeleine vanished from the resort on May  . In the footage, he can be seen laughing as he is filmed by three German travellers he had offered to drive from Portugal to Spain.The clip has been dated to March  .Watch the clip and read the full story here.Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B has “nothing to hide”, his lawyer has said.Police in Germany have said they have firm evidence, including mobile phone data, linking the -year-old to Madeleine’s disappearance.Lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said: “Where is the evidence “Why has the prosecution not revealed it “There won’t be a trial for my client for Madeleine McCann. I am certain.”He added that,the case does ever go to trial, his client would face the court “serenely and calmly”. “He has nothing to hide,” he said. Christian B allegedly boasted to a pal about performing a sex act in front of a room full of sleeping British girls.The convicted sex offender told a close friend that he crept into a holiday home in Portugal naked and started masturbating.He only fled when one of the teens woke up and began to alert her friends, its claimed.The friend broke his silence about the alleged incident after seeing this week’s police searches in Germany, the Mirror reports.He said: “The strangest thing he ever told me was about breaking into a room where four teenagers from Britain were sleeping on the sofa and floor.“He was naked and had left his clothes outside and he was masturbating.#When one woke up and tried to wake the others up he panicked and ran out.“He said he ran naked through the town. He told it like a funny story.”The new owner of Christian Bs old home has said she fears she is living over a body. The woman, a -year-old tour guide, has reportedly called on police to search the property, which sits on the edge of an allotment plot in the city of Braunschweig.Christian B lived at the house for the three years up to , and the woman reportedly contacted police after he was identied in a television report last month.Speaking to the Sunday People, the woman said: “I am worried he may have buried a body here.“I want the police to dig the ground and check.”A top forensic expert has said that #every contact leaves a trace# and that she is optimistic the Madeleine McCann case will be solved. Professor Angela Gallop CBE is a world-renowned scientist whose work has helped to solve numerous cold cases.Speaking to the Sun Online, she said: “There have been so many cases where it has looked so hopeless at the start, but where we have been able to dig out something which has led to a resolution.“I’ve always been interested in this case – after all this time it would be extremely tough.“But one thing I’ve found with some of these really dficult crimes is that you never say never about anything.“I’m an optimist by nature and an optimist now because of my teams’ success in helping to solve so many of these complex cold cases.“[The concept] that every contact leaves a trace I now know to be absolutely true. The dficulty is usually in finding the traces in the first place.”A German traveller who hitched a lt from Portugal to Spain with Christian B has said its scary to think who he was. The man, known only as Tomas, is one of three travellers who features in footage shot in Christian Bs campervan during a trip on March  .The trip took place around  months after Christian B committed a rape of a -year-old woman, a crime for which he was convicted in December last year. “He seemed like any other ordinary young man. He was cheerful and joked a lot and [was] happy to give us a ride in his VW van,# said Tomas.“He didnt mind us filming him and taking his pictures. He was happy to pose and must have known we could never suspect what a terrible man he really was.#It is scary to know now that he was a rapist of an elderly woman and targeted children. We couldnt have known that he was such a monster in truth.#The lawyer representing Christian B has called on prosecutors to disclose the evidence they say links his client to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Police in Germany have said they have firm evidence linking the -year-old to the case, though have withheld some of it. They have said previously that mobile phone data has placed Christian B near the McCanns apartment on the night Madeleine vanished. Lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said: “Where is the evidence #Why has the prosecution not revealed it #There won’t be a trial for my client for Madeleine McCann. I am certain.”The suspect modied his VW camper van to be able to hide a child, it is feared.The paedophile lived in the vehicle above a basement at an allotment in Hanover around the time three-year-old Madeleine disappeared.He once boasted he could have used his VW campervan to transport children.Dein Ghafou, who owned a garage complex Hanover used by Christian B, told police: “I told them he had been working on a ­Volkswagen Camper here and he would lt the roof up and then make it smaller again,” he told the Mirror.“He was always cutting the roof, raising it and then lowering it. He came and went here.”Neighbours of Christian B at the allotment said he lived in the VW LT camper van in  and .The lawyer of Madeleine McCann prime suspect Christian B has blasted as “an act of pure desperation” searches of his client’s former allotmentFriedrich Fülscher goaded cops and prosecutors in their bid to the nail -year-old paedo for killing Madeleine saying they’ve “backed the wrong horse”.Fülscher insisted the search of old allotment plot in Hanover this week, which uncovered a secret cellar beneath the earth, was an elaborate show to revive interest in the investigation. “The site has been known by prosecutors for years,” he said.“It is an act of pure desperation by them to appear to be working on it now. “It seems the public prosecutors office are finding it hard to admit they have backed the wrong horse.”Madeleine would now be  years old.She was born May , , and went missing a little more than a week before her fourth birthday.Authorities are also hopeful that social media could help find Madeleine, using her distinctive eyes to examine photographs on Facebook.The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will never co-operate with the police, his lawyer says.Convicted rapist and child abuser Christian Bs lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said his client would not help cops trying to find out what happened to the missing three-year-old.“Before our client starts to co-operate with the prosecutors office, you could order holy water as a long drink in hell,” Mr Fulscher told the Sydney Morning Herald.“That is not unusual. It is very normal not to talk to the police when you are suspected of committing a crime.“The prosecutors office has to prove that a suspect has committed a crime, and not the suspect prove that he hasnt.”A mum has claimed the Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B exposed himself to her daughter while trying to chat to her.Paedophile Christian B, , was caught with his trousers down under a slide in San Bartolomeu de Messines,  miles from Praia da Luz, Portugal, where Madeleine disappeared when she was aged three.The German national was arrested in  after he committed a sex act in front of four youngsters.Christian B was extradited to Germany and is currently behind bars for drug offences.A top forensic expert said Madeleine McCann’s disappearance WILL one day be solved.Professor Angela Gallop, a world-renowned scientist whose work has helped to solve numerous cold cases, said the riddle would finally be solved because “contact always leaves a trace”.Speaking to the Sun Online, Prof Gallop CBE explained: “There have been so many cases where it has looked so hopeless at the start, but where we have been able to dig out something which has led to a resolution.”Read the full story here.Several years ago, on the th anniversary of Madeleine McCann’s abduction, her anguished family thanked supporters for giving them hope in a heartbreaking letter.Kate and Gerry McCann addressed the message to “our dear friends” in Praia da Luz, Portugal.The poignant letter written in  said: “We miss her every second.“Despite the evil and hurt that has come our way, we have been very fortunate, having witnessed and experienced goodness and kindness in great abundance during this long and dficult period of stolen time.“We are especially grateful to our friends and supporters in Luz for being strong enough and brave enough to keep Madeleine and our family in your prayers and in your hearts.“Your love and compassion has given us fortitude over the years and sustained our hope in immeasurable amounts.“There will never be too many times to thank you… and so thank you for everything… but above all, for not giving up on Madeleine.“With our love and our very best wishes, Kate, Gerry, Madeleine, Sean and Amelie – and all our family.”Christian B kept kids’ clothes and swimwear in his mobile home, it has emerged.Convicted paedophile Christian B, , bought the red and white Allegro Bay RV in early  — three years after moving back to his native Germany from Portugal.Pals said he used it to drive regularly back and forth between Germany, Spain and Portugal and once boasted how he could allegedly “carry children and drugs” inside.Cops found the clothes and swimwear after seizing the RV as part of their probe into missing Inga Gehricke, who disappeared in  during a picnic with her parents.Christian B used a derelict crate factory at Neuwegers­leben as a weekend pad where he kept the RV.The items were found there in  along with USB sticks containing images of child sex abuse.Other images on the sticks included some of Christian B partially naked or wearing stockings performing a solo sex act.The six data sticks and two memory cards were found buried under the body of his dog at the factory, wrapped in a carrier bag.The suspect once lived in a squalid villa in Portugal – just a few miles from where the youngster went missing in The Algarve.Pics of the “disgusting and vile” farmhouse-style property show rubbish scattered outside and a badly overgrown garden.Neighbours in Portugal described its former resident as an “angry” man who vanished suddenly after leaving a bizarre collection of wigs and exotic clothing.One told Sky News: “He arrived in the mid-nineties and rented the place from the English owner.“He went back to Germany at one stage and moved another German guy in to look after it, then came back and threw him out on the street.“He was always a bit angry, driving fast up and down the lane, and then one day, around , he just disappeared without a word.”The woman then added: “About six months later I was asked to help clean up the place and it was disgusting, absolutely vile.“It had been trashed, with broken stuff like computers all over the place.“We found a bin bag and inside were wigs and exotic clothing, whether just fancy dress or something stranger I couldnt tell.”She revealed she was later contacted by Scotland Yard who quizzed her about her former neighbour.Christian B, who we are not naming for legal reasons, is the prime suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance and was born in Germany in  but moved to Portugal in his late teens.The -year-old paedo – who has twice been convicted for sex crimes against kids – was thought to live nearby where the holiday villa when Madeleine disappeared in .The pervert is believed to have been leading a “transient lestyle”, travelling to and from Portugal and Germany.He was convicted of raping of a -year-old American woman in the same resort where Maddie went missing, but is to appealing the charge.In Kate McCanns book, ‘Madeleine: Our Daughters Disappearance and the Continuing Search for Her,’ she revealed the details of Gerry’s final check on his daughter.She wrote: “After ordering his food, Gerry left for the first check just before :pm by his watch.“He entered the apartment via the patio doors and noticed almost immediately that the children’s bedroom door was further ajar than it had been.“He glanced into our room to make sure Madeleine hadn’t wandered in there, as she was prone to doever she woke in the small hours.“Seeing no little body curled up in our bed, he went over to look in on the children.”It adds: “Madeleine was lying there on her left-hand side, her legs under the covers, in exactly the same position as we’d left her.A top forensic expert has said she is confident the Madeleine McCann case will one day be solved.Professor Angela Gallop CBE is a world-renowned scientist whose work has helped to solve

The dficulty is usually in finding the traces in the first place.Just last week, German authorities examined an underground tunnel as they continue to investigate suspect Christian B as the new prime suspect in Maddies disappearance.The -year-old sex offender had been in Praia de Luz at the time of Maddies disappearance.And he was this year named as German police announced a major breakthrough in the decades old case - claiming they had concrete evidence that Madeleine was dead.As part of the investigation, it is hoped a tiny scrap of blue material held in the vaults of a Portuguese forensic lab could provide the vital link between Christian B and Madeleine. Tests uncovered a microscopic a DNA profile initially identied as semen, but later confirmed to be saliva.Scientists were unable to obtain a full DNA profile at the time but have continued to work on it with new testing techniques.Authorities now hope that continuing advances in DNA testing may yet provide a full profile for comparison with the convicted paedophile and rapist.Portuguese cops had launched an initial search when the little girl vanished in , with the politan Police then taking on the probe to find Maddie in . So far, more than£. million has been spent on the investigation.The case has drawn worldwide attention, with Madeleines own parents even accused over her disappearance as theories over what happened to the three-year-old abounded.But despite the sometimes grim nature of forensic work, Prof Gallop has remained motivated.She said: “People’s freedom, and often their sense of justice is at stake.“Also family feelings andthey have lost a loved one – there is the need to provide proper closureat all possible.“All of these things you are well aware of, and I think it just drives you to do as well as you possibly can.“Stick at it and be as careful, innovative and accurate as you can – that’s what keeps you going.”But she is also quick to point out it hasn’t just been her but a team of scientists who have helped solve these cold cases.It was in  that her team managed to piece together what happened to Rachel Nickell, a -year-old woman who was murdered on Wimbledon Common, in South-West London in .Thanks to Prof Gallop’s team, a tiny trace of DNA that had previously been missed was found, leading to the conviction of Robert Napper  years after Rachel’s death.In another investigation with staggering attention to detail, Prof Gallop and her team found a tiny blood stain on the shorts of John Cooper.The blood belonged to Peter Dixon, who had been killed alongside his Gwenda Dixon in Pembrokeshire in .Cooper was ultimately given a whole le order for the  double murder of siblings Richard and Helen Thomas along with the Dixons in .It is this fastidiousness to detail and objectivity in investigating that Prof Gallop is keen to pass on.Due to cuts around police funding, more forensic investigations are being done in house.Prof Gallop said: “I’m just left wonderingthis is appropriate.By her own admission, she wasn’t that interested in school and struggled towards the end of her university about what she was going to spend her le doing.Then one day a friend showed her an advertisement in the paper to work in forensic science.She said: “I realised I wanted to do something that involved applied science, as opposed to pure research for example, and that was more immediately important for people in general.“One of my friends came over and said have a look at this ad in the newspaper – is that applied enough for you ”Starting her career working for the Home Office Forensic Science Service in , she has since started her own forensic laboratories and even been awarded a CBE in .So what has kept her going through her career of more than four decades Prof Gallop explained: “I find it fascinating, the whole investigative aspect to it. It’s like peeling an onion and seeing what each layer reveals.“I was pretty awful at school until the last few years but they always used to say I was very tenacious.“If something interested me, I would always stick at it until I really understood it.“That’s been handy to have – that attitude of needing to get to the bottom of things.”And while others may use CSI-type shows and podcasts to relax, Prof Gallop mostly stays away from the recent trend of true crime.She said: “Personally, I can’t watch much of it. Butit provides entertainment for others, that’s fine.“People need to be entertained but I will inevitably get irritated by the inaccuracies and the way things are portrayed. As ever, I think real le is much more interesting.”However, she does admit to having a soft spot for Inspector Morse - as he works around her birthplace of Oxford – and a touch of Agatha Christie.She has written a book herself – When the Dogs Don’t Bark: A Forensic Scientist’s Search for the Truth.In it, Prof Gallop examines the lessons she has learnt over more than  years in science.She added: “We all know these days about cognitive bias where,you are expecting something, you may be more likely to think you’ve found it.“Andyour budget is restricted, and you’ve only been able to do a few tests on one or two items, you’ll only get half the picture and you could draw wholly inappropriate conclusions and end up misleading people.”She added: “I’m also worried that all the lessons we’ve so painstakingly learned about how to solve dficult cases will be lost. It’s all about combining novel approaches to find evidence with new technology to analyse it – not usually one or the other on their own.”And she pointed out how effective forensic science could be when it was used properly.She said: “It has been demonstrated time and time again, that it is so much cheaper to spend slightly more money on forensic science up front than having endless re-investigations and public inquiries.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety.

The measures we are putting in place - a hierarchy of controls about hygiene and bubbles within schools - are the most effective method of reducing risk.Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, who is advising the Governments coronavirus response, said the brief window before schools reopen must be used wisely otherwise new restrictions will be needed.He wrote in the Observer: Most urgently, we need to ramp up testing. We are not where we need to be. We must improve contact tracing, so were identying more cases and providing better, faster data locally.If we dont, we may not be able to reopen schools without introducing new restrictions where. These are the trade-offs we face -we do not act now.Shadow education secretary Kate Green called for greater support from ministers in making schools safe with extra resources and for them to boost the tracing of potential infections.I do think the Government could be doing more to support themparticularly, for example, making sure weve got a really robust test and trace system in place, the Labour MP told Times Radio.Its really, really important that we dont write off a generation of Covid children - they need to be back in class the whole of our futures depend on this.National Education Union deputy general secretary Avis Gilmore called for ministers to be clear about supporta second wave of the virus strikes.Robust track, trace and test alongside health and safety checks in schools and colleges are necessary, she said.If, based on scientic evidence, there is a choice between schools being open and other sectors having to close to keep the R below one and thus avoid a second spike then there is no contest - that is what should happen.Mr Gibb said this week the Government cannot decree that classroom education is prioritised, instead saying decisions will be made by local health chiefs.But a Number  source insisted that Mr Johnsons expectation is that schools will be the last to close.The PM has been clear that businesses including shops, pubs and restaurants should be forced to close first, with schools remaining open for as long as possible, the source said.Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, is among those who have suggested more restrictions may be needed when schoolsafter saying the nation has probably reached near the limit or the limits of what can be done to reopen society safely.It comes as another , tested positive for Covid-, compared with  on the previous Sunday.The Government said , people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, up by eight from the day before.

But ministers dismissed the suggestion as Boris Johnson set himself on a collision course with teachers and union leaders over the planned reopening of classrooms next month. Britain recorded its highest daily increase in infections since June yesterday – ,. It is the first time the figure has gone above , for two months, and  higher than the  new cases reported on Saturday. Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, claimed testing staff and pupils should be “part and parcel of what running a safe school within these very dficult times means.” She said the tests should be carried out regularly “and that may well be weekly”. Avis Gilmore, deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Robust track, trace and test alongside health and safety checks in schools and colleges are necessary.” But Nick Gibb, the Schools Minister, rejected the pleas for such regular Covid- testing. He said: “All the advice we’ve had is the measures that we’re putting in place, the hierarchy of controls about hygiene and so on and bubbles [small groups] within schools, is the most ­effective method of reducing the risk of transmission of the virus.” There are around . million school pupils in England, , teachers, plus teaching assistants and other staff members. The UK’s total test capacity is estimated at , per day – with only around , tests processed daily last week. In the case of a local lockdown, the Prime Minister is thought to favour ordering pubs and shops to close so schools can stay open. Boris Johnson said there was a “moral duty” to get children back into schools in September. Mr Johnson insisted we “now know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely”.  Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has warned rules on other sectors would have to be tightened when pupils . Prof Whitty is among those to have said the UK has “probably reached near the limit” of what can be done to reopen society safely. Schools in Scotland start a “phased ” from tomorrow.

Ministers have ‘paused’ the government’s shielding rules - which until last month required millions of people with a broad range of conditions to stay at home. Even as tighter lockdown rules were reintroduced in Greater Manchester, the shielding programme was still paused in those areas, meaning people in vulnerable groups were able to leave the house for the first time in four months. But the plans under consideration would be a “stiletto, not a sledgehammer” - and would pinpoint especially vulnerable people in a local area and tell them to stay indoors.

Weaver Vale MP Mike Amesbury could be turfed out of the s office block in Runcorn, Cheshire, as Boris Johnsonaposs controversial planning rules are extended across the country. Developers plan to turn the block into  flats - seven of which will be smaller than the Governmentaposs recommended minimum space standards. A previous application for  flats, which would have seen a third smaller than the minimum standard, was withdrawn in December after local outcry. But under new apospermitted developmentapos rules being rolled out as part of Mr Johnsonaposs aposProject Speedapos, developers are allowed to convert office blocks into flats without applying for full planning permission. Councils are only allowed to object to the proposals on a very limited number of grounds. The Prime Minister said the new rules would make it easier to build better homes where people wanted to live. But Mr Amesbury is formally objecting to the plan. He warned the developeraposs proposal doesnapost mention any plan to replace the building’s s single-glazed windows or efforts to remove any asbestos that may exist in the building. And he said proposals for just  parking spaces are insufficient. Mr Amesbury said: “It’s bad enough that the current rules allow developers to turn ancient, run-down office blocks into cheap flats but under the Government’s new Developer’s Charter, these appalling conversions will become the norm. [Communities Secretary] Robert Jenrick claims the planning system doesn’t work but the truth is that most applications are approved. This is about the Tories giving a leg up to their developer friends, pure and simple - at the expense of local communities.”  He added: I will fight these plans tooth and nail butthe Government passes these changes into law, there is nothing to stop The Tories’ rich developer mates from doing what they like here in Runcorn or anywhere . I fear we are now facing a new era of slum housing in this country. “People in Runcorn and across the country are begging for the Government to put their street before Downing Street: they need good quality housing, not matchbox flats in converted s office blocks.

And the PM must act NOW to prevent it, a former government chief scientic adviser warns today. Sir David King said: “We need a proper test and trace system by September. Otherwise full school opening will put us right back.” Sir David says we are “nowhere near” the safe reopening of schools. He is urging Boris Johnson to “get it right” in August – or face a second wave of coronavirus infections. And he blasted the Government’s track and trace policy as “disastrous”. Sir David, , heads the Independent Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies shadowing the Prime Minister’s scientic team. He said: “The Government has a month to deal with the level of infectivity as it stands now. Reopening schools should be a priority, but we believe we are nowhere near the point where it can be done safely.” He said the R rate of infection number is expected to rise by about . with all schools open. On Friday, government figures showed the national rate as between . and  – the tipping point – as infections rise again. “We need a proper test and trace system by September,” said Sir David. “Otherwise I’m sure school opening will put us right back. We will see the Government backing lockdowns and, yes, I do think this could happen nationally.”  Sir David – who set up Independent SAGE amid concerns about political interference on the official advisory committee – said: “Test and trace is still failing dramatically. Tracing here is one phone call and you are asked to isolate. There is no follow-up as to whether people do.” He urged the PM to take track and trace from private firm Serco and let councils run it. “The Government made a disastrous mistake giving contact tracing to a firm with no healthcare expertise,” he said. “The Serco contract is up for renewal this month. They’ve had roughly £million so far. They’ll get £ millionit’s extended. This is not working. When you hit , new cases a day, it’s an enormous number for any national body to deal with. But break it down into local regions and the numbers become manageable.” Sir David said the Government should follow other countries and put isolating members of multi-generational households in hotels to avoid infecting relatives.

But the three-star Newquay business has a good reason for the price surge - they actually donapost want anyone to take it.The Kilbirnie, a -bed hotel in the town, advertised a “superior double room with a sea view” on Booking for the huge sum, reports Cornwall Live.It would have set you back over £, on Saturday night - but on the plus side, you could have made a saving on Trivago … of £. Just when you might be thinking they’re trying to make a quick buck out of all the tourists desperate for a post-lockdown break in the sun, click on Expedia and the same room is just £. In a bizarre twist, the hotel is advertising the room at such an exorbitant price to STOP people staying. And the room itself isn’t available anyway – the Kilbirnie is fully booked. Hotel manager Gary Ricketts explained that a glitch in a booking system has meant rooms have been sold to guests via online vendors which aren’t actually available, so this is a move to ensure there are no more disappointed customers. He explained: “Three dferent customers booked rooms through Booking last week and expected to stay here, but we were fully booked. “This is a way of combating that – it’s crazy, no one’s going to pay £, to stay for the night. It’s true that our rates are at a premium, as are everyone’s, but we know no one’s going to pay that amount £ maybe but not £,. “It’s to combat the fact we don’t have any rooms and yet they might appear on the site.” Gary added: “People are seeing these rooms on booking sites and expecting to come to Cornwall but there’s very little availabilityanything everywhere is full. “They’re saying there’s an issue with the system. It’s an issue either on our side or their side. No one can find out what the problem is. “I know of at least two other hotels in Newquay alone that have had this problem. “I’d rather deal with the problem of someone wanting to pay that than someone coming down, expecting to have a room and we haven’t got one. If someone wants to pay over £, they can stay at my house!” He said it wasn’t as simple as just removing the listing as a room at their hotel might still appear available because of the system error.

He was the highest-paid performer in the world and the first Brit to sell a million records. Not bad for a lad who worked in a coal mine aged . Arguably Scotland’s greatest ever performer, Harry – born  years ago this week – became a friend of Hollywood stars and royalty, and the first popular entertainer to get a knighthood. But his success was blighted by tragedy when his only son, John, died in  fighting in the First World War. After John’s death, he threw himself into the war effort, raising money for wounded soldiers, and helping to enlist men. And he started the tradition of entertaining the troops at the front, for which he was knighted in . Among Sir Harry’s most popular songs were Roamin’ in the Gloamin, A Wee Deoch-an-Doris and the perennial favourite, I Love a Lassie. Churchill said: “By his inspiring songs and valiant le, [he] rendered measureless service to the Scottish race and to the British Empire.” Sir Harry once said: “Happiness is one of the few things in this world that doubles every time you share it with someone .” He was born Henry McLennan Lauder on August ,  in Portobello, Edinburgh, to mum Isabella and dad John, a skilled potter. Both his parents were from well-connected and well-off families and Harry, the eldest of seven, grew up in relative affluence. In , the family moved to Derbyshire, where John got a job designing porcelain. But shortly after the relocation, he died of pneumonia. Isabella moved the children back to her family in Arbroath in Angus, using John’s £ le insurance to help pay for the journey. Harry, then aged , had to work at a flax mill to help support the family and pay for his education. A couple of years later, they moved in with Harry’s uncle’s family in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire. The three eldest boys became coal miners, an experience Harry said he was “proud” of. He once said of the mines: “I was entombed once for six long hours. It seemed like six years. There were no visible means of getting out.” But there was some light amid the struggle. Harry fell in love with Ann Vallance, the daughter of a colliery manager and the pair wed in June .  As a child, Harry found he had a knack for singing and started performing at school and entering competitions. His first professional appearance came in , and shortly afterwards he joined a concert party that toured Scotland. By the turn of the century, he’d made it to London. Variety magazine said of his first performance in the capital: “In , a Scotch coal miner stood on the street opposite the Tivoli Music Hall. “He had taken a week off to visit London to seek a vaudeville engagement. Before the week was out the miner was booked for  consecutive weeks.” Aged , he had made it. His famous character – kilted, bandy-legged, sentimental, with an eye for a bonnie lass and a wee dram and carrying a knobbly stick – made Scottish culture, or caricature, known the world over. In , Harry undertook the first of  tours of the United States. He made the first of his  recordings in  for The Gramophone Company. Radio was another lucrative medium for Sir Harry – he was once paid £, for one broadcast featuring three of his songs. By the time First World War broke out, Sir Harry was an international star. He sang for the troops, raised funds for the war and soldiers’ charities and formed the Harry Lauder Recruiting Pipe Band which toured Scotland and England. Reports say he convinced more than , men to enlist.  But then tragedy struck when John – a Captain in the th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders – was killed in action in , in Pozieres, northern France. Sir Harry was told John was shot by a German sniper. Devastated, Harry wrote it had felt like “everything had come to an end” and “the board of le was black and blank”. Anne convinced Harry he should go back on stage, as those who worked on his show relied on him. Three days later, he was back performing. He broke down when he sang The Laddies Who Fought and Won, about boys coming home from the conflict. Archie Foley, a Harry Lauder historian said: “As the curtains closed, he fainted.” During this  tour, he went to the French war cemetery where John was buried. He wrote: “As I lay there on that brown mound, all that he had been, and all that he had meant to me and to his mother came rushing back, opening anew my wounds of grief.

Laurel Phizacklea, two, wasnapost expected to survive birth because of a cruel condition which occurs when the babyaposs abdominal wall does not form during pregnancy. Her parents, Kelly, , and Sean, , were offered a termination at their -week scan when doctors diagnosed their unborn child with a major exomphalos. But Laurelaposs parents decided to give her a chance and the tot defied medics predictions when she was born at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge in June . Most babies with the condition have the organs reinserted into their body at birth, but due to the unusually large size of Laurelaposs exomphalos, doctors warned she wouldnapost be able to have them internalised until she is three years old. Laurel was left with a protruding bump from her tiny tummy - which her parents have to wrap in bandages to support her external organs, in case the weight of them were to pull anything  out of her body. Skin has formed around the organs, and Laurel can eat, drink and go to the toilet like any other toddler - but her parents have to keep an eye on their aposdaredevilapos tot, as any injuries to the exomphalos would be irreparable. The mound doesnapost bother the little girl, who loves to cradle her exomphalos when her bandages are removed for bath time, often stroking it and saying aposah tummyapos.  Kelly, a volunteer supporting parents in neonatal care, from Cambridge, Kent, said: I donapost know how we remained positive throughout my pregnancy with Laurel. It really looked asshe wouldnapost survive birth - but Sean and I never gave up hope and she has done us so proud. Her pouch of organs on her tummy is a part of her and she doesnapost let it get her down. Laurel is a true inspiration and amazes us every day. Laurel and Sean, a car dismantler, were over the moon when they discovered they were expecting their first child in October . The couple excitedly attended their -week scan to get their first glimpse of their baby - but were blindsided by the news that something was wrong. They said that our babyaposs organs were on the outside of the body, Kelly said. I couldnapost believe that was even possible. Doctors explained that the coupleaposs unborn child had exomphalos - a type of abdominal wall defect which occurs when a childaposs abdomen does not develop fully while in the womb. Early in all pregnancies, the intestine develops inside the umbilical cord and then usually moves inside the abdomen a few weeks later. In exomphalos, the intestines - and in this case the stomach, liver and bowel - remain inside the umbilical cord but outside the abdomen. Doctors also determined that Kelly and Seanaposs baby had a spinal deformity - and the pair were offered a termination. We couldnapost quite believe what we were hearing when they offered us an abortion, Kelly said. People kept saying: aposItaposs OK, you can try againapos - but I didnapost want another baby. I was so in love with this baby and we knew we would do everything we could for her. Amazingly, after just three-and-a-half-months in Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, Laurel was able tohome. We knew sheaposd need the big operation further down the line, but just having her home was so special, Kelly said.  We quickly realised she was an adventurous baby, so knew weaposd need to keep an eye on her so she wouldnapost damage her exomphalos. Surgeons warned the couple thatLaurel damages her external organs, thereaposs nothing they can do - so the family are patiently waiting until Laurel turns three and can have her organs internalised. If inserted into the body too soon, and when her frame is too small, the diaphragm wouldnapost be able to cope with the sudden lack of space with which to operate. As it is, Laurel will have to aposlearn how to breathe againapos when she undergoes the operation at the beginning of .

To fill the time, many people have taken up new hobbies and some families have said their new shared interests have brought them closer together - and they plan to continue them going forward. As the governmentaposs restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey with Very has looked back at how we all spent the strictest months of lockdown and how people view the “new normal”.Both kids and their parents have the opportunity to do new things, with  per cent of mums and dads with teenage kids saying theyaposve tried something for the first time or more often than normal. Cooking and baking is the most popular aposnewapos activity, with  per cent of parents with teenagers and  per cent of people with younger kids surveyed listing it. Gardening and exercise were next up on the list in both groups. Meanwhile, their kids have also enjoyed cooking and baking, at  per cent, while  per cent have tried their hand at gardening. Arts and crafts and growing their own fruit and veg also made the top five.Interestingly, the exclusive Daily Mirror and Very survey showed that gardening was far lower down the list for kids younger than , with exercise in second place after cooking and baking.Boys were more likely to have spent more time playing a musical instrument and doing DIY. And for many, the group activities have brought them together as a family. Describing the positives of lockdown, one parent wrote: Being able to help more with the kids home schooling as normally I am in work. Building a veg garden and growing our own veg has been a fun thing for all of us.  And I feel we have all grown closer as a family. Meanwhile, other families used the opportunity to exercise and to improve their fitness. Some even opted to do this all together, either through group work outs or by making it a competition. One parent said: Getting myself fitter by running more on my treadmill. The rest of family doing it as well, so we are fitter as a family physically and mentally. Some made the most of their one trip out of the house for exercise by going out for a walk with loved ones. One wrote: Going for a walk with my daughter and spotting all the wildle and breathing cleaner air. Another added: Going out for walks and discovering areas around where I live that I never knew were there. While everyone has obviously faced their own challenges in lockdown, some people have found itaposs also brought some advantages, Veryaposs research found. Parents of younger kids are more likely to have found the lockdown fun compared to those with teenage children, but an incredible amount say the restrictions have brought them closer as a family.

Mariusz Stepien was searching a field near Peebles with friends on June  when he found a bronze object buried half a metre underground. The group camped in the field and built a shelter to protect the find from the elements while archaeologists spent  days investigating. Among the items found were a complete horse harness - preserved by the soil - and a sword which have been dated as being from  to  BC. Mr Stepien said: I thought Iaposve never seen anything like this before and felt from the very beginning that this might be something spectacular and Iaposve just discovered a big part of Scottish history. I was over the moon, actually shaking with happiness. We wanted to be a part of the excavation from the beginning to the end. I will never forget those  days spent in the field. Every day there were new objects coming out which changed the context of the find, every day we learned something new.  Iaposm so pleased that the earth revealed to me something that was hidden for more than  years. I still canapost believe it happened. As he was getting strong signals from the earth around the initial object, Mr Stepien contacted the Treasure Trove Unit to report his find.  They also found decorated straps, buckles, rings, ornaments and chariot wheel axle caps. Evidence of a decorative rattle pendant from the harness was also discovered - the first one to be found in Scotland and only the third in the UK. The hoard has been moved from the site in a large block of soil and taken to the National Museums Collection Centre in Edinburgh.

Minnie was found with a heavily swollen eye by a member of the public in Hinckley Road, Leicester, in May. She was then taken in by the RSPCA who described Minnieaposs eye as horric and set to work to remove the injured eye. Thankfully, Minnie survived the operation and made a quick recovery.Not only did she survive but she also met her new best friend, Oleg, LeicestershireLive reports.Oleg is a Russian Toy Terrier and had suffered a broken leg which had been untreated for a month. He was signed over to the RSPCA after his owners could no longer take care of him. Because he had been untreated for so long, his leg had to be amputated. But he too made a speedy recovery. The two became best friends whilst in the centre together and were inseparable said Laura Prince, who is an animal care supervisor at the RSPCA Block Fen Animal Centre. It was just a coincidence really that they both happened to be at the centre at the same time, she said. Minnie came into us first and a few days later Oleg arrived. As they both required surgery they were housed in the vet suite and it was there they showed positive interest in each other. When they were both well enough we let them socialise together. They spent the day together in my office and went on walks together and at night they went back into their separate kennels. This worked well for them whilst in our care as it gave them some iety to their day and company for each other. As they both recovered from their operations and began to feel well in themselves they started to become more cheeky and getting up to mischief in the office, we knew at this point they needed to find a forever home where they could settle and get used to having a loving family to care for them.

She headed out for a walk in the sunshine as she wore a gilet over a red top and donned a traditional tartan skirt after over five months isolating at Windsor Castle. Following a conversation with what appears to be an aide at the estate, the Queen then took her beloved Dorgis for a walk.  Sophie Wessex, Edward and their children joined them as the family enjoyed the exceptional weather.It was decided they would not attend church this weekend in a bid to stop people gathering outside.Her Majesty will not be required to wear a face covering for her traditional summer break despite concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic.Before their arrival, courtiers spent weeks planning how to ensure the castle remained safe. Due to the very small number of staff – dubbed the HMS Bubble – that are in close contact with both the Queen and Prince Philip, masks are not needed. The Sunday Times reports that aides are low in number at Balmoral. Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, Sir Edward Young, the Queen’s private secretary, and her trusted pages Paul Whybrew and William Henderson are on site serving the Royal family.Major Nana Kofi Twumasi-Ankrah, the Queenaposs equerry, will also join head groom Terry Pendry, personal assistant Angela Kelly and four other aides at the castle. In order to enable the Queen to ride her beloved fell ponies, only one groom is allowed access to the animals.

Whether you’re Pakistani, ­Bangladeshi or Indian, there’s one shared value – the need to sacrice personal happiness for the overall good of the family, the family name and the community. And while this is a noble value, for many Asian boys born and bred here, it can cause immense stress and anxiety which goes unrecognised in the Asian community and the wider one. My cousin Tariq, who is in his s, says while it’s great that Asian women are finally being heard, men are still suffering in silence. Being a male in this culture means you are born with responsibilities. You are the head of the family after your father, keeper of the family name and you are expected to live with your parents and look after them in their old age. You are expected to marry an Asian girl, and then your we takes over the cooking, cleaning and general household chores. This is a generalisation, but it is true for many Asian men. My cousin is a British Asian. He was born and educated here, but he was still expected to have an arranged marriage. Only trouble is, he fell in love with a non-Asian English girl in his s and she fell pregnant. He had to keep her and the child, and his love for them, a secret or risk bringing shame on the family. He was expected to go to ­Pakistan to have an arranged marriage and bring that girl back to the UK to show what a good son he was. Tariq sacriced his happiness for his cultural expectations and has suffered in silence for decades, not able to express how he felt.He has a relationship with his first son and is happy with hiswe and their children, but it has been an emotional battle – and he can’t help wondering how his le would have panned outhe had followed his heart.Mental health struggles are seen as a sign of weakness in Asian men, and many have turned to drugs and self-harming, sinking into depression, with anger and frustration turning to violence. Even in , young Asian men are facing these same pressures and expectations. It is torture for them. Many men are leading double lives, while the ­community has its head in the sand over their unhappiness and mental health. They are stereotyped beyond belief, dealing with racism and ­prejudice outside their community and being under pressure from inside it.

Unfortunately Jason was busy, but Asda flung open their doors exclusively for the Tipton Twins. And they did it in style wearing unicorn face masks... and headed straight for the drinks section. Britain’s oldest identical twins, they have shopped in the supermarket since it opened more than  years ago and were applauded by staff when they ed to the store. Bosses at the supermarket giant opened their doors at am yesterday to give the ladies – unable to go throughout the pandemic – the run of their favourite shop. The twins were so keen toto the store, they even agreed to self isolate for seven days to protect others at their residential complex. “They spoilt me rotten,” Doris said. “I’ve had my whisky and lemonade. I used to get a bottle every Tuesday. It was lovely to put my shoes on after being in slippers for six months. I might not put my slippers on again.” Lils pointed out they put the Daily Mirror in their trolley and said: “We love it because our photo was in it right next to Jason Statham in a towel.  “It wouldn’t take me long to rip that towel off. We love Asda because the people that work there are all lovely. We always have a giggle with the staff. We want to come back tomorrow “We used to go every Tuesday morning on the ring and ride, we’d do our shop then enjoy a bacon butty and a natter in the cafe. I was dying to go back shopping – nearly as much as I want to meet Jason Statham.” The pair won fans online when arguing over who likes the actor, , the most after revealing they watched every Fast and Furious film.  Lils does have a favourite member of staff, adding: “I love the woman on the chickens she’s a cheeky bugger. She was off today but sent her love.” Doris added: “It’s worth doing the seven days in isolation for this. It’s special getting your own things and not relying on someone . They don’t check the dates.” The twins who made GMB host Piers Morgan blush by telling him the secret to a long le is “plenty of sex” have , followers on social media.  Lil’s granddaughter, Kerry Clarke, , said: “It was just lovely, the experience they had today money couldn’t buy. It was so special. To see how happy they were. “Aunt Doris put the mask on and her glasses steamed up and they had both had a bit of problems getting them round the hearing aids.” The twins are amazingly close despite having vastly dferent lives. Factory steel polisher Lils had five children but raised them mainly as a single mum.

Forecasters say Monday could be the start of the joint-longest extreme heatwave on record - with C a possibility three days running. But severe thunderstorms are also expected during this period with some areas due to see a month’s rain in just three hours.The predicted mm deluge could cause flash flooding and yellow weather warnings are in place nationwide.Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell said: “Over the coming days the extremely hot weather is going to start to feel quite humid and oppressive.“That humidity is what will help create the thunderstorms and we have issued warnings across the UK from Monday to Thursday. “Almost anywhere could see torrential downpours with local risks of flash flooding, hail and high winds.” Coronavirus travel bans have forced millions more Brits to take staycations and day trips rather than flying abroad.On Sunday huge queues of traffic were reported at ‘honeypot’ beaches up and down the UK coast. Officials in charge of Lulworth and Durdle Door, Dorset, closed roads and warned people to stay away. Thanet District Council said Ramsgate Main Sands beach in Kent was “extremely busy”, with high tide making social distancing dficult. Blackpool Police also reported its beaches being busy with a “larger than usual” number of children going missing.  In some areas holidaymakers slept on the sand or camped on grass verges on Saturday to secure parking for the following day. Kara-Jade Haywood, who visited Bournemouth beach at .am today, said: “Every car in the car park had people sleeping in it and the beach was basically a campsite. “Some people were just sleeping on the sand. The car park was full at am with people sleeping in cars and the free parking at the clf top was already rammed with cars. “Some were even sleeping on the grass hill.”  HM Coastguard dealt with  inidual incidents across the UK on Saturday, its highest call-out total for over four years. Many beaches were placed on ‘red alert’ by councils, with the car park closed at Camber Sands, East Sussex. Britain is currently hotter than C Khartoum, Sudan, and the C Males, in the Indian Ocean. Saturday saw .C after Friday’s .C - the hottest August day in  years. And at pm on Sunday a temperature of C was recorded in Herstmonceux, East Sussex. Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said the mercury could rise above C on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  She said: “C is forecast daily, with a low chance of C. “It’s exceptionally hot weather until midweek in the South-East. “Temperatures reaching C three days in a row did not happen before , and since  have only happened in  and , and only for three days in a row. “But potentially severe thunderstorms are forecast to bring torrential rain which could lead to flash flooding.” The average amount of rainfall for England in August is around mm meaning some areas will see one month’s worth in a matter of hours. But there is some uncertainty about exactly where the worst storms will hit, forcing forecasters to issue warnings for the entire country. The Environment Agency said: “Local flooding is possible from surface water and fast-responding rivers on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. “There may be travel disruption and properties may flood.” In Norfolk, police have issued a warning after a swimmer drowned in a water-filled former quarry.  The man, aged in his s, was seen “getting into dficulty” around Saturday lunchtime in water at Bawsey Country Park near King’s Lynn, Norfolk. The death prompted Norfolk police to issue a warning. Superintendent Malcolm Cooke said: “Without wanting to prejudge what has happened here I would urge people to take the utmost care around water and to be aware of hidden dangers such as fast flowing currents, underwater obstacles and weeds.” The hot weather, caused by a  mile wide ‘plume’ from Spain, also led to huge crowds at bars on Friday and Saturday night. Large groups of revellers in Manchester, Blackpool, and Portsmouth were seen standing side by side despite threats that pubs could be closed again. Dr Julian W Tang, a Professor at the University of Leicester, said social drinking carries a higher risk of spreading Covid- than travelling by plane. Describing pubs as a “perfect storm” for spreading coronavirus , he said: “If the air space is poorly ventilated, that air that’s full of virus is not going to go anywhere. “It’s going to linger there until the virus dries up and dies over time.

When Zoe asked whether that was professional, the man responded: I was only having a laugh. Zoe was fuming, and blocked the account in case she received more topless pictures. I reached out in a professional manner, and he sent that out of the blue, she blasted. My modelling has nothing to do with this side of my work. Zoe believesanything her OnlyFans work could be seen as empowering. What I do as an extracurricular activity doesnapost define me, she said.

Grace said: They told us they were thinking he would only last a few minutes, but he ended up lasting a while. Which was good for us because we got more time with him. Grace said she experienced a normal pregnancy and no early scans indicated any issues. She said: From all the other scans heaposd been fine.

She added: It was pretty daunting anyway, but then I ended up being in agony.They had to do a procedure for me because the fluid in hislungs were full, so they had to put tubes in my stomach into his lungs to drain it, and that triggered my labour.I was  weeks pregnant.

We could see him  hours a daywe wanted. There was one nurse called Leah, and she had him for about five days. We got quite close with her and she was the one who took his tubes out when it was time.

The huge rodents, also known as nutrias, have taken over Krauss Baker Park in Texas. A picture of at least of dozen of the swamp rats in the park has circulated on social media, with experts urging the public not to feed them. Local park authorities say the animals can spread parasites to bodies of water that could lead to human infectionsthe water is used for drinking or recreation.  Urban Wildle Biologist Rachel Richter told KSAT : The reason for the thriving population of nutria in Krauss Baker Park is that people are feeding them at this location.People generally mean well when they offer food to animals, but they don’t realize that they’re doing far more harm than good. Feeding wildle is a huge problem that has negative impacts on our local ecosystems and often leads to human-wildle conflict in our communities. The swamp rats can eat up to three pounds every day - or % of their body weight.A colony of them is said to have formed in the area last year, but there are fears more could arrive. On female nutria could produce two to three litters each year, with up to  offspring each time. Looking like beavers, swamp rats have brown fur, long tails and orange teeth. Richter added: They are harmful to humans because they degrade water quality in water bodies that might be used for recreation or drinking water. They are also vectors for pathogens and parasites that could contaminate a water body and potentially infect people. They also have a negative economic impact through the environmental, agricultural, and structural damage they cause.Meanwhile, closer to home, a terried woman claimed huge monster super rats have invaded a street and even destroyed a car. She says the grim infestation has turned her neighbourhood into an attraction - with people descending hoping to catch a glimpse of the large rodents.The -year-old, who doesnapost wish to be named,  told Yorkshire Live  : Itaposs horrible I canapost let my children out to play in the garden as itaposs just not safe."},{"url":null,"title":"woman who gouged eyes out","story":"NewsWoman who gouged her eyes out after taking meth shares joy at getting prosthetic eyeballsKaylee Muthart, , has been blind since a meth-induced psychotic episode in , but said her family cried with joy when she was given new prosthetic eyeballsShareByDave Burke:,  AUG NewsKaylee Muthart has been blind since the devastating psychotic episode two years ago \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

No one wants their plants to die, but what happensthey do  You could go out and get more - costing yourself another great expense - or you could try something rather quirky.A mum has come up with a bizarre way of ensuring the pricey plants in her garden always look green and healthy.Gail Woollaston, , from Birmingham loves a bit of DIY, so she decided to aposreviveapos her dead plants all on her own - and her method had her two children in stitches. The parent went out to her nearest hardware store and purchased some green spray paint. Iaposm sure you can figure out where this is heading... Gail then applied the paint to the brown leaves of her plants and within seconds, they looked good as new.She shared her little trick on Facebook, where she soon went viral. I thought my garden was looking a bit untidy so I decided to come up with my own solution and I think it worked, she wrote. I am DIY obsessed - I up-cycle anything and this was going to be a fun experiment for me. I paid a lot of money for the plants and I didnapost want to get rid of them - I had tried everything to bring them back to le but it wasnapost working. The mum went on to admit that the first time she tried it, the colour of the paint wasnapost quite right and her plants ended up looking unnaturally bright. However after mixing another colour in, things improved. My friends have said that they wouldnapost have known any dferent, she added.

They said I was too small after youth team level.“Usually it’s a case of, ‘He’s too small,’ being an easy excuse but I was about ft  when I was !“I was gone then, thinking my career was done before it had even started but luckily enough I got picked up by Dundee.“It went quite quick from there. I played a few U-s games, established myself and had a good season.“When they were short of players for the reserves I’d come up and join them sitting on the bench.“Luckily enough I managed to come on for a couple of games, done well and just managed to build my way up.“Next minute there was a few injuries in the first team and boys not wanting to play and I was making my full debut at Brechin away.“I was like here we go, Brechin away for my debut. I remember walking into the changing-room thinking to myself, ‘I’m buzzing,’ but looking back now I question why!“It was fantastic, though, and my career has took off since then.”One man who McDonald feels should take particular credit for his success is ex-Dee gaffer Alex Rae.Former Rangers midfielder Rae replaced Alan Kernaghan in the Dens dugout in  as player-manager and McDonald initially feared for his midfield position.He added: “I knew straight away I was done but he’s the manager at the end of the day so I was still young and ready to accept it.“He came in and he was at it. He put himself straight into a reserve game and, to be fair to him, he was absolutely brilliant.“He was a player and absolutely battered us. He was the biggest signing for Dundee when I was there.“It was such a high-profile player and manager to have besides all the Italians.“When he came in it was a bit of a wake-up call because he raised the standard as such.“He was quite hard on people but it was what the club needed at the time.“He was hard on me because he could see I had potential to go on to another levelI wanted to.“He was the same with Robbo , DickerandSwankie – the lot of them.“He helped me, to be fair, because he was a centre midfielder he helped me massively.“He was smashing people in training on a daily basis. Normally managers want you to take care in training a little bit but he was wanting you to go in hard.“If you were pulling out of a tackle, he was hammering you so it got feisty at times but he loved that everyone was playing hard for their places.“He brought that mentality to the club.”McDonald began to establish himself in Rae’s side, rejecting interest from Celtic and Everton, before moving to Burnley for £,.He was a standout in Scotland’s second tier but not at any point did he find it easy.McDonald said: “After a couple of goals you do gain a bit of confidence and then there’s the media hype and that.“It did start to feel easier as time went on. The more I played, the more I got into it and felt more comfortable.“I’d never at the time say it was easy when you’re going to places like Airdrie away and they’re absolutely battering you.”Of the transfer interest, he added: “I’d see so many people and heard so many stories of people going to Celtic and being a number.“They had a -man squad, some incredible players right the way through their set-up, such strength and depth throughout the whole club.“I had a chat with my agent and family and said I don’t think I fancy going there at all.“I knew there was a couple of clubs interested down south still. That was the swaying point and I thought I needed to give it a blast and go there.“I had the choice of Burnley and Everton and went to Burnley. I don’t know how that one worked out to be honest.“It was Owen Coyle who sold it in the end. He was incredible.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – United back in the big time and Danny Mullen in at Dundee\" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – United back in the big time and Danny Mullen in at Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-united-back-in-the-big-time-and-danny-mullen-in-at-dundee embed # secretMFquPRpdMj\" data-secret\"MFquPRpdMj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

But that’s OK.Yes, Hemmings is almost definitely a better goal-scorer and probably a greater all-round player than his replacements but he doesn’t want to be with the Dark Blues and Danny Mullen and Alex Jakubiak do.Having watched them extensively at St Mirren in recent times, their commitment to the cause, I believe, will be immediately evident to Dundee fans.Mullen, in particular, is a passionate sort.He performs best when riled and up against it, his energy seemingly endless and with a phenomenal work-rate to boot.Prolic he is not but he is good for a goal, and no stranger to a wonder strike.The -year-old former Livingston man loves being in the final third, gets his team up the park and is surprisingly good in the air despite not being the tallest frontman.Of course, a lot of this is known to Dees, with Mullen scoring three times against them in their   relegation season.The nippy forward also bagged a crucial goal against city rivals Dundee United in the Premiership Play-off Final that term, proving he can be a man for the big occasion.A lot of Buddies fans were disappointed to see Mullen let go but their loss is the Dark Blues’ gain.He could make all the dference in getting Dundee back into the top flight.Jakubiak, too, was a favourite among the Paisley faithful and a serious target for boss Jim Goodwin.His wage demands proved too much for St Mirren so it is curious to see him at the Dee.His quality is without question, however, and paired with Mullen they may just fill Hemmings’ void.They might not have made the best start to the season but Motherwell should be the benchmark for Dundee United.Going by last term’s standings, outwith the Old Firm, ’Well are the Premiership’s top side.Despite their opening day - defeat at Ross County on Monday night, Stephen Robinson’s side hold a title United should be aiming for – the best of the rest.Third is the most anyone in Scottish football can realistically hope for with the big two from Glasgow about.And why not the Tangerines  They are one of Scottish football’s biggest and most historic clubs after all.Hearts would usually lay a claim to being Scotland’s third power but, with the Jambos now in the Championship, it’s open for a few others.Aberdeen and Hibs would be the other obvious candidates but the Steelmen have shown what can be achieved on a smaller budget.Whatever the result is at Fir Park today, the Terrors shouldhome inspired to lay claim to ’Well’s unofficial crown.The myth of English football exceptionalism persists.This week it was the wholly unexceptional Jamie O’Hara bumming up the Premier League while laying into our game at the same time.The former Tottenham midfielder claimed relegated Bournemouth would be a bigger job than European football with Rangers for Steven Gerrard.Utter nonsense.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

I am really sorry that this slip has affected that too on this occasion, but that not only shows the extraordinarily dficult location and the extreme conditions yesterday which caused the landslides but also emphasises the real problem that any replacement route will have in terms of constructing it in such a very challenging spot.#Nonetheless, a solution that guarantees uninterrupted access has to happen and I have also fought for that alongside many local people. However, such a complex undertaking inevitably takes time.#The £ million that has been spent to date has been vital in reducing incidents like this and also ensuring that they get cleared as quickly as possible and that is the work that will be going on today.  That needs to take place as quickly, but also as safely, as possible.#Meanwhile I will be working with the Transport Secretary in order to urge whatever acceleration of the design and planning process for a replacement can take place and I would welcome support in that from any other quarter including opposition parties.#All traffic is currently being erted via the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.  The ersion route is being patrolled and monitored to check for any issues and ensure traffic is kept moving.  Temporary traffic lights are currently in place on the A at Inveruglas after yesterday’s heavy rain affected a retaining wall, causing some damage to the road.  Traffic Scotland are also providing additional advanced warning signs for road users to inform them of the closure at the Rest and Be Thankful so motorists can plan an alternative route in advance.Western Ferries have also added additional sailings on their usual Gourock to Dunoon route to help accommodate motorists.Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #Further assessments need to be completed by geotechnical specialists of the hillside and both roads to check for any further concerns, and until these checks and the clear-up is complete the A and OMR will remain closed.In the meantime, Argyll remains open for business and we encourage road users to follow the ersion route in place for motorists.  Western Ferries are also running additional sailings for their Gourock to Dunoon crossing to accommodate road users.Please check Traffic Scotland for most up to date travel information.#Real-time journey information is available on www.traffiscotland.org, twitter at @trafficscotland or the mobile site my.trafficscotland.org."},{"url":null,"title":"assessment and clear up operation continues at rest and be thankful","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be serialised on this page very soon."},{"url":null,"title":"column-tourist-home-help-love-area","story":"I WAS on holiday a couple of weeks ago and on one of the days I went to the local amenity site.There I found lots of people who, like myself, were pretending that clearing out the house was the next best thing to being in some far-off beauty spot.A few days later, I went out on an early morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the simple things that sometimes familiarity overlooks.I can take time to appreciate things that normally the hurry and the care of le make miss.Maybe being a tourist at home will help me love Musselburgh and East Lothian more.As a Christian, I know that my faith is not about denying the dficulty and pain that surrounds us.People of faith look to see the possibility of Godrsquos love reaching out to them, and from them to others, when le is hardest.Living with faith is about seeing the world in a way that expects to find hope.I know that recent months have been hard for people in so many ways.But I also have heard so many people say that they have seen more clearly what is important to them and the people they love because they have needed to slow down, to live more simply, to keep closer to home.Perhaps we have an invitation to reflect on the things that we have seen in a new way over the past months, things that we have appreciated and enjoyed.Perhaps we can all find hope in a promise we make to ourselves: we will enjoy the good things we have seen around us in new ways, and to hold onto the positive changes we have made in these hard times, even when our livesto lsquonormalrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"bus-route-extended-take-edinburgh-royal-infirmary","story":"From Monday, Prentice Coachesrsquo  service will provide a direct link from the eastern side of Musselburgh to the hospital.There will be seven weekdayjourneys, setting off every hour from Seton Sands between am and pm, withjourneys from the hospital between am and pm.On a Saturday,  journeys will alternate with  journeys to provide a mostly hourly service from the hospital.This extension to the hospital service will be for a trial period to gauge customer demand.A spokesman for the Hadington-based bus firm said: ldquoService  has always been very popular with passengers but, due to being in a low fare zone, revenue was poor this added to the drop in overall passenger numbers due to Covid- has meant it has been very dficult to justy reinstating the route.ldquoWe hope the added option of travel to the Royal Infirmary will in time boost passenger numbers and then hopefully in due course we can expand the number of daily journeys.Meanwhile, a new  service is being launched on Monday.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union.

No corroboration would be needed for group B to justy the complaint and resultant charges against group A, but immediately on doing so, it would be acting in a way that could \"stir up hatred\" against group A. Group A would then have a valid complaint which could presumably result in the group B being charged. There would also be documentary evidencethat group B had acted against group A.Comedy potential aside, the implications of the bill on the future of free speech in Scotland are scary and anyone who is not familiar with the proposals should be finding out more.

Seventy-five years ago I walked out of Changi prison weighing only six stone, and since that time I have remembered comrades who never came home, but I also know that I am alive today because those terrible weapons of war were used.I have recalled those events every day since, they never leave me, and I do have a sense of guilt that I still enjoy le whilst people in Japan remember with sorrow family members they have lost.Eleven years ago I went back to the River Kwai to pay respects to those pals who are buried in Kanchanaburi Cemetery andit was very pleasing to find Japanese tourists there doing likewise. I also say \"never again\".Jack Ransom , Largs.DAVID Pratts article discussing the Cold War legacy of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not mention the part played by the United Kingdom Government in the further development of these nuclear weapons.The UKrsquos development of nuclear weapons involved testing these weapons in Australia and on the small North Pacic island of Kiritimafrom  to . This has resulted in long-term suffering to the native Australian population and to the native inhabitants of Kiritima. There were also around , British servicemen involved in these tests. Many of these servicemen died at an early age, from a multitude of rare and unexplained illnesses, a large number of their wives had miscarriages, often multiple, and many of their descendants are now suffering from ious unexplained illnesses.For years successive governments have denied that these deaths and illnesses were in anyway linked to the servicemenrsquos presence at these tests. At present the British Nuclear Veterans Association is campaigning for the Government to award a medal to the men involved in these tests.

That adequately demonstrates firmer power in action within that relationship.A cost to Scottish students that was not mentioned was the increased housing costs. Large numbers of well-funded international students have driven up the price for local accommodation and has pushed many Scottish students to live further away from their place of study, particularly for the less well-off. An extra hour of daily commuting is a large cost over four or more years.We were told that our universities let out a collective sigh of relief that they will not have to refocus on Stemsubjects, health workers or teachers. This is the wrong attitude and is looking at education costs without consideration of value. Give the universities the money but only for areas of greatest consequence. Train more doctors, dentists, scientists and engineers here in Scotland.Tom Walker, Loanhead.LETrsquoS KEEP FIGHTING TOGETHERI HAVE noticed that during this coronavirus pandemic ndash currently ongoing contrary to popular belief ndash that the usual snipers from both sides of the independence debate continue to have a sneaky shot when the opportunity arises.

Thanks should also go to Jason Leitch for the clarity of his guidance both to the Scottish people in general and directly to the wider UK audience when answering specic questions - you are a credit to Scotland.Every political leader in Scotland should step forward and take a bow on current performance in tackling Covid- and take a vow to continue working together until normal service is resumed. The time will come when you can all resume your normal ndash but insignicant ndash bickering, but in the meantime, thanks for all your efforts in showing a united front and keeping Scotland safe.In the words of my -year-old mum, ldquoI donrsquot really bother much about politics, but I feel safe in Scotland, wersquore in good hands with Nicola.Letrsquos keep fighting this current pandemic together and make it our priority to lead by example by keeping Scotland safe.Tom Cassells, Ayr.SPORTSCENE SPOILEDTHERE was considerable excitement and anticipation at the prospect of theof Saturday night Sportscene after a long absence of  years.That was because the Scottish football public had inferred the programme was going to be the hugely successful line-up of Jonathan Sutherland, Steven Thomson and Michael Stewart. They are a marriage made in heaven because they are experienced, intelligent, articulate, get on well together and their sense of fun and banter reflects that. Few BBC Scotland programmes get a bigger audience. It was the jewel in their crown.What on earth have they done  Gone is the highly articulate Michael Stewart, who has played at the highest level and speaks with authority. Were they leaned on Some critics have suggested this is the familiar London-based tick-box political correctness, given Sportscene is inflicting Shelley Kerr, Leanne Crichton and Julie Fleeting on us. For some time now they have failed on the likes of Saturday Sportscene Results where the likes of David Currie have rescued them repeatedly. On Championship Sportscene they are rescued by Steven Thomson. They detract from both programmes. Both presenters have had to resort to questions where the reply was framed by the question.Yes they are intelligent, articulate and friendly but they are experts on the womens game. They do not have the background knowledge of the mens game outwith the big five clubs, so the expertise and spontaneity are jettisoned to the detriment of the programme.They do have some excellent guests like Marvin Bartley and James McFadden, who merge their knowledge of the game with a great ability to poke fun at themselves, but neither is a pundit.This has been a great disappointment.

While peanut allergy in its several forms is frequent in Britain and a cause of misery to many, both adults and children, I have yet to see a case in East Africa, probably because no additives or preservatives are added to the peanuts.Simsim or sesame seed butter is even richer than the groundnut version, with a tart taste and no sweetness but rather a hint of the savoury.

Occasionally, he likes to get up and demand a cuddle, but mostly hersquos just enjoying the nap and the fact that therersquos nothing much to do today.Ali says she could not have survived lockdown without Clyde. The young dog got her through the worst period of her le, she says, and then when things were looking a bit better, lockdown hit and he got her through that too. Being on your own for weeks on end is disconcerting, says Ali, but it helped to have the dog at her feet. You canrsquot be truly alonetherersquos a dog around.Ali isnrsquot the only one who feels that way. The Battersea Cat and Dog Home has been doing some research recently into how our relationship with pets has been affected by the lockdown conditions and the conclusion is that, for many of us, the negative effects have been eased by having a dog or cat about the place. Many pet-owners report that their anxiety about the situation has been eased or reduced by their pet.This is certainly true for Ali Ramsay. The -year-old from Glasgow used to be a Flight Lieutenant in the RAF and was totally immersed in the military le. ldquoIt was my work le, my social le, my fitness le ndash I played volleyball for the RAF, she says. ldquoIt was everything.Then she was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes chronic pain, and she was medically discharged from the service. It was the beginning of a long dark period in her le.ldquoI didnrsquot want to leave the RAF, she says. ldquoI had  more years of career ahead of me and I wanted that career, but because of my condition, I was medically discharged. It wasnrsquot a choice. I had no career, no purpose. And then I had tribunals just to get my disability pension so I had financial worries. I would have lost my houseit wasnrsquot for my family and forces charities helping me out. So I was in a bit of a dire state.It got so bad that at one point, she says, she considered suicide ndash she was depressed because of the pain and had lost all the enjoyment in her le. But thatrsquos when she contacted the Scottish charity Bravehound which matches dogs with veterans to improve the quality of their lives. Suddenly, there was some purpose back in Alirsquos le and it was brought about by a chocolate Labrador called Clyde.ldquoI needed the dog sooner rather than later, says Ali, ldquoor I wouldrsquove found myself not being here. I was going through hard times and I needed the dog to live. The dference between ending my le and living was having a dog. It gave me something to live for, and a project, and a focus. He was the dference between having somebody  to care for when I didnrsquot care about myself.The positive effects of Clyde have also been amplied by the lockdown. Before the restrictions were imposed, Ali was attending regular training sessions with Clyde and meetings with other veterans and then, suddenly, it all stopped. No more meetings. No more socialising, although the training sessions have continued on Zoom.ldquoI was in my home  , says Ali, ldquoand the only thing to get me out was walking Clyde. And although everyone was socially distanced, even saying hello to another dog walker, I had some human connection. Also, having Clyde around the house got me through it. I would talk to him ndash although hersquos a dog, hersquos another being and I was able to talk to him and interact with him all the time. Hersquos either lying beside me at my feet or on the bed. And he loves cuddles.Fiona MacDonald, the founder of the charity that matched Ali and Clyde, says she has seen similar effects with many other people during lockdown.ldquoDogs are more important now than ever, she says. ldquoIn the current climate when wersquore being asked to stay at home and are feeling isolated, theyrsquore helping people leave the house, stay active and prevent them from feeling alone. The unwavering companionship of a dog can do amazing things for people ndash they literally save peoplersquos lives.However, itrsquos not all positive. For a start, Bravehound, like other charities, is facing a shortfall in funding because of the financial impact of coronavirus and is calling on people to sponsor puppies. There are also concerns about the effect lockdown may have on pets and other animals: the Dogs Trust, for example, says it has seen an increase in the number of animals being abandoned.Lockdown seems to be having two effects. First, itrsquos led to an increase in the number wanting to adopt or take on a pet ndash Google searches for ldquobuy a puppy were up more than % during lockdown ndash which in principle is a good thing. But therersquos also a worry that the easing of lockdown will bring up a new reality and problems for some owners and that there will be an increase in the number of dogs being abandoned or handed into places such as the Dog Trust.Susan Tonner, the manager of the Dog Trustrsquos centre in West Calder, has said one of the reasons people may be struggling to cope with their pet during lockdown is the financial and economic stress that the crisis has caused, but it can also be the change in circumstances: suddenly, the change in routine causes behavioural changes in the dog and the owner is unable to cope.Mike Flynn, the Scottish SPCA chief superintendent, tells me the effect of the public health crisis on pets is a concern, but that he remains hopeful. ldquoWe believe Scotland is a nation of animal lovers, he says, ldquoand wersquore hopeful that we wonrsquot see an upsurge in pets coming into our rescue and rehoming centres that were purchased or adopted during lockdown.ldquoHowever, wersquod urge anyone thinking about taking on an animal to remember that they are a long-term commitment. Once the restrictions end, people willto work, school and socialising as normal and could find that an animal may not fit into their le as easily as before. We appreciate these are uncertain times for many people but abandoning an animal is never acceptable under any circumstances.Another potential problem is that an increased demand for pets may also lead to potential owners buying from unscrupulous owners and breeders. The Dogs Trust, Cats Protection and other organisations and public figures including Paul OrsquoGrady, recently published an open letter calling on the public to#research animal breeders and sellers thoroughly#online before buying a pet.Christine Middlemiss, the UK Governmentrsquos Chief Veterinary Officer, says prospective owners needed to beware of the kind of seller who breeds animals purely for profit and has zero concern for their welfare.ldquoThe devastating consequences include crippling vet bills and, in the worst cases, animals#having to be put down, said Ms Middlemiss. ldquoItrsquos vitally#important#that people not only research the breed of animal they want but also the person selling it to them.And even for those animals who do not get sick or who are not abandoned, the end of lockdown could be tricky. For months now, many dogs have had their owners around the house day in, day out, which is the way dogs like it . But now that the restrictions are being eased, people are starting to go out more and some are going back into the office, and that can cause extra stress for dogs.Ben Evans, a dog trainer and advisor to Burns Pet Nutrition, says owners should take action now to acclimatise their dogs to the new reality and prevent them from developing separation anxiety or behavioural problems.ldquoOwners need to normalise the fact that being alone is not a big deal by doing plenty of it in short bursts, he says. ldquoStart off with just - seconds, gradually building this up to minutes and eventually a couple of hours. Leaving and ing should be relatively uneventful as animated greetings or goodbyes can build up anticipation or anxiety.ldquoItrsquos also important to desensitise dogs to any signs that indicate you are about to leave. Try picking up and putting down car keys throughout the day, opening and closing doors without leaving, picking up and moving shoes and bags, or putting on a coat and walking around with it before removing it. All these steps will help to prevent these possible triggers from causing anxiety.Fortunately, Clyde isnrsquot one of the dogs whorsquos going to be facing a separation from his owner and Ali says shersquos feeling positive about the prospect of coming out of lockdown. One of the things both owner and dog have missed during the period of the restrictions is a swim: both of them used to be regulars at a hydrotherapy pool ndash it helped to ease Alirsquos physical pain and Clyde loved it too ndash and she hopes that they will be able to get back to the pool soon.Ali is also getting out on longer and longer walks with Clyde. ldquoI donrsquot necessarily enjoy walking because of the pain, she says ndash she sometimes uses a stick and sometimes has to use a wheelchair. ldquoYou donrsquot go walking on your own when yoursquore in pain but Irsquoll put it up with it more because he needs the walk and he distracts me from the pain. Clyde is one of my coping mechanisms. Even stroking him or cuddling him is a distraction. It releases all the happy chemicals and lowers my heart rate and blood pressure.For Ali, the fact that Clyde has helped make lockdown bearable ndash as well as everything  he does for her ndash has made her appreciate him even more. As she talks, Clyde is still lying fast asleep at her feet. Ali says her relationship with him is deeper than itrsquos ever been. He makes her happy. He has eased the pain. He saved her le.To find out more about Bravehound and sponsor a puppy, visit bravehound.

Opponents fear that some sections of the original structure could disappear and be lost.Controversy surrounds the plan which is supported by central government in France, but opposed by the Mayorrsquos office.If the re-development takes place, it will be hoped to have the work completed in time for the  Olympics.When the Paisley-based architectural reclamation company got wind of the scheme, they wrote to the Gare du Nordrsquos operations director to declare an interest in relocating any of the old ironwork, back to Scotland.ldquoWe have simply asked for our details to be kept on file so that we can at least make attempts to bring anything of importance that might become available back to the city where it was produced, said Glasgow Salvage partner Scott.ldquoThese spectacular pillars and roof supports are extraordinarily beautul andany of it is threatened with demolition or is scheduled to be scrapped, we want to be in with a shout, and have provided a strong declaration of interest to that effect.ldquoWhen any items as fine as this become available, they really should be brought back to Glasgow, as it is such an important part of the cityrsquos proud engineering heritage.ldquoEvenwe just got a chance to bring a few pieces back to the city where they were made, that would be terric.Paris city hall has pledged to fight a central government commitment to the redevelopment of Gare du Nord, Europersquos busiest railway station. Opponents have labelled the proposal a potential urban disaster.Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Greacutegoire, responsible for overseeing all urban development, has promised to look at all political and legal options to stop the scheme in its tracks.He has described the current plans as ldquoabsurd.Central government created the backlash when plans were unveiled to in effect triple the footprint with anambitious plan to create commercial space and increase the area available to rail travellers, with , square metres for shopping, offices and leisure facilities and around , square metres more allocate d to the arrivals and departures halls.The railway station is currently used by around , passengers each day. It is predicted that number could rise to , by .A government statement recently issued maintained that the revamped complex should be ldquoa new setting for urban le, combining commerce, sport, culture and work, and that development should be underway ldquoas soon as possible.The proposed timetable would aim to bring the project to completion for the  Rugby World Cup and  Olympics and Paralympics.ldquoWe are not opposed to the stationrsquos renovation, which is necessary, Greacutegoire said, ldquobut the Gare du Nord should be a railway station before all , not a shopping centre first.In a recent open letter to Le Monde, the award-winning French architect Jean Nouvel, together with historians and town planners, claimed the renovation plan to create a glass structure with tens of thousands of square metres of shops, walkways, split-levels and escalators was ill thought out and would deform the historic structure.ldquoThis project is unacceptable and we demand a rethink from floor to rafters, they said, adding that it would be ldquoindecent to send travellers up and down ldquoa mess of walkways, lts and escalators, forcing them past shops to reach their s.They said that the vast areas of the ldquobeautul train hall would be ldquodenatured and warned that creating a giant shopping centre would pose a risk of killing off the commercial activities of smaller local traders.Speaking from their yard in Paisley, Stuart Haughey said it had been the warning about structural changes to the original layout that had first alerted them to the possibility of some of the old ironwork detail becoming potentially surplus and available.ldquoAs others have said, we too feel it would be vandalism to remove any of the original structural skeleton of the building which is such an integral part of its design and charm, but we would primarily be interested in saving any important architectural pieces for future generations to be able to see the accomplishments of the past.ldquoClearly, the cost of transportation back to Scotland will be a major consideration. ldquoThese are truly massive pieces, he said.ldquoThere are several haulage firms sending goods from here to Paris on a weekly basis, and always looking for aload. Irsquom sure something could be worked out.ldquo...and, then, of course, therersquos the rail network!ldquoMaybe we could try to organise some kind of special freight deal with SNCF and Eurostar and hope they are familiar with our historical links in the past through the Auld Alliance.In the letter which was sent off this week, the brothers state: ldquoWe specialise in reclamation of quality architectural salvage and would be very interested in bringing any artefacts back to the city in which they were so well made all those years ago.ldquoWhile appreciating that discussions on design and layout of the refurbished railway station and proposed shopping mall are at an early stage, we simply ask that you retain our contact details so that, in the event of any of the old structure being disposed of as part of these plans, we would at least be given the opportunity to make efforts to have those relocated to Glasgow, possibly as a combined effort with others involved, and in consultation first with Glasgow City Council."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-view-responsible-stopping-coronavirus","story":"If the renewed strict lockdown of a major city is a blunt instrument, it is one that the Scottish Government has shown no hesitation in wielding and, in doing so, proven itself swt, decisive and consistent with its own stated policies.

That clear message is not merely theoretical or rhetorical, but a bald statement of necessity.The purpose of lockdown was to contain and dampen the spread of the virus, to protect the most vulnerable through shielding, and to allow time for the restructuring of services ndash particularly the NHS ndash so that they would not be overwhelmed.It was not intended, and could never have managed, to eradicate the disease, or confer immunity. Covid has not gone away, and the renewed rise in cases on the Continent suggests that relaxing restrictions is a balancing act that requires constant vigilance and, where necessary, local containment.Given the requirements for restarting the economy, and the basic psychological dficulties of coping with a sustained, universal lockdown, things have to start cautiously ing to some trade-off with the disease. As things stand, the Scottish Government looks justied in having placed Aberdeen back into special measures, dficult though the decision must have been.Blanket restrictions of this sort, which create so much dficulty for those not directly affectedmay be necessary now.

Those who, after donning their masks and queuing correctly before entering shops, then blithely ignore the requirement to maintain distance need to be reminded of their responsibilities. Penalties should be enforced on those who fail to self-isolate on theirfrom foreign holidays.It is understandably dficult to maintain these rules in environments such as pubs, but those landlords who have made determined efforts to reorganise their businesses for their customersrsquo safety should not be penalised for the irresponsibility of those happy to throw caution to the wind. Local authorities already have ample powers to withdraw licences from unruly venues the warning that they will not hesitate to use them to protect health in this emergency might win the attention of those which have been too casual in their approach.As schools prepare toafter a long and damaging hiatus, the First Minister is surely right that education is a greater priority than the freedom to have a pint in a scrum by the bar. The example of Aberdeenrsquos footballers suggests that some young people, buoyed by their own sense of invulnerability and relatively low level of susceptibility to the diseasersquos worst effects, have forgotten that the rules ndash as with masks ndash are not primarily for their protection, but of those who are vulnerable to devastating outcomes.That may seem like excessive caution, unnecessary for the majority, but it illustrates why Aberdeen had to reenter lockdown. If iniduals take greater care with their own behaviour, such scattergun approaches may be avoidable, but they are inevitablepeople do not abide by the rules, whether or not they think they have much relevance for their own circumstances. Scotland has come a long distance, but it cannot afford to lose its way at this critical juncture."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11672294.jpg?type=article-full","title":"calum-murray-pathway-sustainable-future-clear","story":"ldquoWe are seeing real interest, particularly from businesses who have already done a good deal to lower their carbon footprint and who now want to find meaningful ways of offsetting the rest of their carbon output, he says.Murray points out that things have moved on hugely from Scotlandrsquos initial mass reforestation efforts in the mid-s to s. Those efforts were driven almost solely with an eye to commercial s and led to a general perception that these woods were dark, forbidding deserts as far as wildle and flora were concerned.For some years now new forest plantings by Tilhill Forestry and other forestry companies have focused on creating woodlands that encourage bioersity as well as providing commercial s that consistently outperform global stock markets.ldquoToday, there is a well understood need for the planting of new forests to create a balance between commercial requirements and the need to create forests that enhance the natural environment, Murray comments.One of the benefits of companies turning to forestry as a way of offsetting their residual carbon footprint, is that it makes money available for schemes that perhaps would not be commercially viable without additional financial support.ldquoThere are some great government grants for tree planting, but we often find customers struggling with potential projects in marginal land that just fall short of being commercially viable. This is where the investment from carbon-offsetting schemes can lt the whole project, leading to the planting of many hectares of forests that otherwise would not happened, he comments.Tilhill and other established forestry companies act as brokers to connect companies with a requirement for carbon offsetting, with landlords who have schemes that could be viable, given additional sources of investment.As Murray notes, commercial forestry does not just lock up carbon for the forty years or so that the trees are maturing. When the wood is turned into building timber, the carbon in the timber continues to be locked away for many decades thereafter.ldquoThe whole forestry industry has learned the lessons from the mistakes of the past. I walk through commercial woodlands every day and they are alive with deer and a wide iety of birdle, as well as a range of wild flowers.Many commercial forestry projects these days also include a iety of deciduous tree plantings in order to create a balance. When it comes to locking up carbon, Murray points out that it doesnrsquot matter whether the driving idea behind the creation of the forest is commercial, or a desire to restore some of Scotlandrsquos indigenous woodland. Both take carbon out of the atmosphere. However, fast growing commercial woodlands comprised largely of Sitka Spruce will lock up more carbon faster than deciduous woodlands, which mature at a much slower rate.ldquoIt is dficult to overstate the importance of commercial forestry to Scotlandrsquos rural communities.ldquoIt brings much needed jobs to rural areas at all phases in the le of a forest, from the initial planting, through the letime maintenance of the forest and in the harvesting, he says.Murray adds that as well as the wider societal and environmental values that woodland brings, through the positive impact it has on carbon sequestration, reforestation also improves an arearsquos water quality and helps with both flood mitigation and bioersity.ldquoWe are seeing a real uptick in investors who are attracted both by the idea that investing in forests helps to preserve the environment for their children and grandchildren, and by the recognition that s from forestry tend not to be correlated with the ups and downs in the mainstream equities and bonds markets, he says.The combined appeal of a goodon their investment along with the idea that they are helping to combat climate change, is stoking investor interest in the sector. ldquoForestry particularly favours those seeking long term capital gains and increasingly it will favour lsquoheritage investorsrsquo, those for whom ecological and climate change mitigation concerns rate as high or higher than concerns over the scale of monetary s, he notes.One of the positive stories over the past year was that Scotland finally managed to achieve the Scottish Governmentrsquos planting targets. ldquoThe Scottish Government has set an annual planting target of , hectares of new forest. Last year we actually achieved in excess of , hectares of new plantings, Murray says.The governmentrsquos target is set to rise to , hectares a year by . However, Murray points out that to meet the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to go carbon neutral by , we should already be planting , hectares a year across the UK. England, which is still doing very little new planting, needs to take a leaf out of Scotlandrsquos book and get busy planting, he says.Tilhill Forestry is currently running a project called ldquo#PlantTreesAplentyIn. This is a campaign launched by Tilhill to encourage farmers, landowners and companies to plant trees on their unproductive land.As Murray explains, as part of this campaign Tilhill can help landowners and farmers decide what trees to plant and where to plant them. Todayrsquos new woodlands offer opportunities for wildle, recreation and will play a part in mitigating climate change.Planting a well-planned woodland on land that is marginal for agricultural use can help to provide shelter for cattle and sheep, as well as providing the farmer with a decent pension on retirement.This article appeared in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day series, under the topic of Nature and how we boost our ecosystems.For more information on the#PlantTreesAplentyIn please visitwww.tilhillTo participate in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day coverage on the nd August please contact Stephen McTaggart on  or by email atstephen.mctaggart@heraldandtimes"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11672398.jpg?type=article-full","title":"celeb-2020-five-scottish-castles-used-uk-series","story":"The hugely popular show will be swapping the New South Wales jungle for a ruined castle somewhere in the UK ndash with speculation growing that it could be in Scotland.Ant and Dec will host the series as celebrities undertake gruelling trials and challenges to win food and treats in the lead-up to one of them being crowned king or queen of the castle, rather than the jungle.ITV recently confirmed that the  series of the show would go ahead amid the coronavirus crisis but did not offer details on where filming would take place.:UK filming location revealed for Im A Celebrity as show set to take over ruined castleReports suggested on Sunday that the location has been confirmed as a castle in North Wales.But where could the filming have taken placeit came to Scotland Herersquos fivecastles in Scotland that could have been used:Caerlaverock CastleWhere: Dumfries and GallowayThis awe-inspiring castle is one of the finest in Scotland and would surely make for dramatic television.It has a moat ndash which could be perfect for water trials.And itrsquos twin towered gatehouse and imposing battlements make for a suitable backdrop for the special series.Doune CastleWhere: StirlingshireIf yoursquore looking for a castle suit for a TV production crew then look no further.Doune Castle featured heavily in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Game of Thrones and Outlander.Itrsquos imposing tower and open grass courtyard could be utilised perfectly for Irsquom a Celeb.Blackness CastleWhere: Near FalkirkThis th century castle showcases spectacular views of the Firth of Forth ndash could that be perfect for Ant and Decrsquos speedboat arrival Like Doune Castle, Blackness also has a history of hosing film locations ndash with Mary Queen of Scots and Outlander.Aberdour CastleWhere: FeIf size is what TV production crew are after, then Aberdour could be in with a shout.The th century fortied estate hosts a large and imposing suite of buildings, with a large open garden perfect for our celebrity campsite.High walls could also prove a bonus ndash keeping unwanted eyes away from the site.Eilean Donan CastleWhere: Inverness-shireWe all know that when it comes to Irsquom a Celebrity, ITV like to go big.And where bigger than Scotlandrsquos most iconic castle, Eilean Donan.Itrsquos one of the most recognised castles in Scotland ndash which could prove a selling point when going from the beautul beaches of Australiarsquos Gold Coast and mysterious jungles to the less-spectacular sights of the UK.What have ITV said Kevin Lygo, ITVrsquos director of television, said: ldquoWe announced last week that we were doing all we could to make the series and Irsquom thrilled that we can bring the show to viewers, albeit not in the jungle.ldquoWe have a great team both on and off screen and I know they will produce a hugely entertaining series.Richard Cowles, director of entertainment at ITV Studios, said: ldquoWe pulled out all the stops to try and make the series happen in Australia.ldquoUnfortunately, due to the ongoing Covid- pandemic and despite us looking at many dferent contingencies, it became apparent that it just wasnrsquot possible for us to travel and make the show there.ldquoHowever, we are all really excited about a UK version of Irsquom A Celebrity.

The second time we went out together we found a solid silver Edward I coin dating from  ndash . This might date back to the time when there was a market close to the old Ogstoun Cross.Mr Campbell said:ldquoThe very first time we went out detecting together we found a time capsule outside St Michaelrsquos Kirk which sits in the grounds of the school. ldquoIt was only thirteen years old but nobody knew it was there: it must have been buried by a couple of former students. That was just in our lunch-hour during the tattieholidays. We realised there was a lot waiting to be found.Since then the two friends have found a coin from Charles II reign in the rsquos, a George III shilling from , a florin from  as well as a throwing disc which could date from the time when Prince Philip attended the school. Mr Campbell described the moment they unearthed the old throwing disc, which dates back to possibly the s.ldquoWe were in front of the main school building and got a hit. We dug down to the stone foundations of the original drive but the target was below that. ldquoOur hole was getting bigger and bigger until we spotted a substantial brass ring. At first, we were worried in case it was a grenade or a bomb but then we realised it was the brass edge of a vintage throwing disc. These had a brass surround and centre with wood in the middle and was probably thrown by a pupil in the rsquos or rsquos. What we donrsquot know is how it ended up under a layer of heavy stones.The pair have also found bullets and shell casings on the North Lawn ndash an area which would have been used as a sports field by both Prince Philip and Prince Charles when they attended the school. These munitions date from WW when the school was requisitioned for use as barracks by the army. The pair have also found a silver George V sixpence from .ldquoThat was only an inch and a half under the surface, said Mr Campbell. ldquoIt would have been a devastating amount to lose for the person who dropped it.The archaeology under the ground at Gordonstoun is so rich because it has been protected by high levels of security around the school.ldquoEven though wersquore employees, we had to seek permission from the bursar before we could start detecting, said Mr Marchi. ldquoShe said that was fine as long as we found something valuable enough to pay for a new school master plan! All our finds are of a very low value so far but we love finding things that tell a story.The schoolrsquos archivist is now helping the pair by sending them historic pictures of the grounds and gardens which they use to identy new hotspots to try but, despite the excitement of it all, it has to take second place to the day job.ldquoThe only problem is that I get nothing done when I go to see the archivist because I get so absorbed in the old maps, so Irsquom trying to stay away! said Mr Marchi.The Principal of Gordonstoun, Lisa Kerr said:ldquoGordonstoun has a fascinating history and itrsquos so interesting to see what has lain undisturbed just under the surface of the ground for centuries.

Yet, it was as predictable as it was depressing. Ironically, in choosing to lsquomoderatersquo down the performance projections of working-class children it highlighted what happens when middle-class mediocrity is embedded in the system. There was no imagination here no measure of intellectual rigour. The SQA stuck to a template designed to convey, as always, the fig-leaf of a modest reduction in the attainment gap. It was also a metaphor for the way Scotland is run.Nicola Sturgeon and her Education Minister, John Swinney ndash brass necks reinforced to an industrial standard ndash seemed satisfied that the credibility and integrity of the lsquosystemrsquo had been maintained.

Those examination league tables were all that mattered, those shallow and contaminated measures of a schoolrsquos real worth.The effects of coronavirus have been disproportionately harsh in Scotlandrsquos poorest communities. In Inverclyde, home to our most deprived neighbourhood, deaths from Covid- are three times higher than the average. Pupils from these areas have experienced disproportionately the emotional and psychological effects of sickness and death among family and friends. This year, of all years, they might have felt they were entitled to a break. Every other year the system of academic preferment is programmed to reward affluence and economic muscle. Perhaps this time they might be judged on a level playing-field, after all theyrsquod been through. Dream on.Certainly, the pass rates might have been unusually higher but this has been the most extraordinary of years. Future generations would have understood. This week our children discovered there is no mercy in the hallowed system.Yet, all that was required was the capacity to think bigger and to imagine better to be spontaneous and nimble. Instead, all these children got was a rule-book waved in their faces and a letter telling them the computer said no. It seems the Scottish Government are much more focused on plans to criminalise the lieges. But hey the system has been preserved and therersquos just enough movement in the numbers to earn a tick.The Government has betrayed our most disadvantaged children when they needed their compassion. In two decades of unbroken left-wing, devolved administration in Scotland the same families, living in the same neighbourhoods are still experiencing the same wretched outcomes in their health and their chances of a better le. In England, the most right-wing government in modern political history saw this coming and made the necessary arrangements to preserve fairness. The Conservatives actually tweaked the system to favour children in need. Sweet Mother of God!A normal political party would be held to account on these issues by its own dissenting voices and perhaps be threatened with eviction at a nearby election. The SNP, though, is not a normal party. While it bears the eternal flame of independence its supporters are cowed to silence lest they be accused of jeopardising the Holy War, the unforgiveable sin. Independence, for the SNP hierarchy, has become a safety harness rather than a cause.In the two decades since devolution we have seen the rise of think-tanks and lobbying firms. These make a virtue of moderation and centrism and are cherished by the SNP because they instruct us all to sit up straight, behave ourselves and keep our mouths shut. All of them are inter-connected but not in a way thatrsquos visible to the naked eye.They harbour a few dozen of the elect who wield influence on policy and strategy. Together they form an intellectual and philosophical black hole where radical ideas disappear and die. In exchange for this they get invitations to sup at the Bute House Presidential Palace or get thrown a seat on a quango or a health board. Thus, the triumph of middle-class mediocrity is assured.This week, an outfit called the Commission for School Reform stepped up to provide relief for the Scottish Government. Its chairman, Keir Bloomer, architect of Curriculum forExcellence, said: ldquoIf anything, I think the overall set of results demonstrate that they [the SQA] have been slightly lenient.The Commission for School Reform is one of those prattling colloquies which occupies the same territory as think-tanks.

If you want to see what complacency and self-congratulation looks like google Scottish think-tanks and prepared to be stupefied by one of their many, sleepy treatises.Since the start of lockdown the Scottish Government and all the indolent quangos which feed from them have had a chance to prove their worth. All they had to do was find a solution to the exams dilemma that didnrsquot penalise children who were already marginalised by their precious system.

The captain of the nuclear-powered sub radioed for permission to attack.The defence secretary, following Cabinet agreement, later recalled that it was the easiest decision he had to make.At :, on May , the torpedo tubes were loaded with three unguided Mark VIII torpedoes with impact fuses and and -pound warheads. These missiles pre-dated the Second World War but were reliable for the close-range attack, unlike with the latest wire-guided Mark  Tigerfish torpedoes, which captain and crew found unreliable.At three minutes before pm the captain ordered the firing of the torpedoes.The first stuck the target near the bow, essentially blowing it off. The second detonated in the machine room and tore through the crewrsquos nearby mess area which was full of sailors changing sht. The blast killed  of its , crew.The side-effect,it can be so described, destroyed the shiprsquos electricity systems, knocking out the pumps and making it impossible to send out a distress call. The third torpedo missed entirely, struck a nearby ship but failed to explode.The cruiser which was now listing badly to port was a -year-old American-built warship that had survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.In , it had been sold to Argentina and renamed the ARA General Belgrano. It would not see out  and survive the Falklands War.When he was asked later about the sinking of the Belgrano, the Conquerorrsquos captain, Chris Wreford-Brown, responded wryly: ldquoThe Royal Navy spent  years preparing me for such an occasion. It would have been regarded as extremely drearyI had fouled it up.The Sun newspaper greeted the sinking of the Belgrano with surely the most infamously memorable headline of its controversial le ndash GOTCHA ndash although the text claimed the sinking of another Argentine ship.The Belgrano had been sunk outside the -mile maritime exclusion zone that Britain had imposed around the Falklands and, according to reports, had actually been heading for port.There had been a Peruvian peace proposal  hours earlier, which Britain would later acceptand in a live television interview on BBCrsquos Nationwide the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, denied that she had received it. The Belgrano was a threat to British ships, she said, justying the action.In the Green Room after the show, Thatcherrsquos husband Denis, drink in hand, lashed out at the producer saying that his we had been ldquostitched up by bloody BBC p**fs and Trots.The controversy over the sinking did not end with the war .And it simmered in the most unlikely place, inside the Civil Service in the Ministry of Defence.At the time, Clive Ponting was a -year-old senior official, an assistant secretary, earning pound, a year, more than pound, today. He was in charge of the MoDrsquos Defence Secretariat  and was heading for the very top.Thatcher had told the House of Commons the Belgrano was steaming towards the -mile exclusion zone imposed by Britain around the Falklands when she was torpedoed, with the loss of  of the shiprsquos company.However, Ponting had drafted two papers stating that the cruiser had altered course and was moving away from the zone.When his papers, which became known as the Crown Jewels, were withheld from the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Ponting, in July , sent the two documents in the post to the Labour MP for Linlithgow, Tam Dalyell. The documents revealed that the Belgrano had been sighted a day earlier than officially reported, and was steaming away from the Royal Navy task force, and outside the exclusion zone, when attacked and sunk.Dalyell had resigned from the shadow Cabinet over the reconquest of the Falklands and was as voluble opponent of Thatcherrsquos. He had spoken in Parliament against the action and was therefore an obvious destination for the ldquojewels. Dalyell realised they were political dynamite.He passed them to the select committee, whose chairman contacted the defence secretary Michael Heseltine, who then ordered a leak inquiry.The papers were soon traced to Ponting, who was interviewed by two MoD police officers, who told him they were not sure an offence had been committed. They suggested he quietly resign.However, ministers demanded his prosecution. It came in the wake the MoDrsquos embarrassment over the case of Sarah Tisdall, a junior civil servant jailed the year before for sending photocopies of documents concerning the deployment of US cruise missiles in Britain to . On August ,  ndash  years ago next week ndash Ponting was charged under Section  of the  Official Secrets Act.His defence, before a security-vetted jury, was that he had leaked, and to an MP, in the public interest. The judge, Mr Justice McCowan, was having none of it ndash he had considered halting the trial and giving the jury a direction to convict ndash and in his summing up he said ldquothe public interest is what the government of the day says it is.Ponting was convinced he was going to be jailed, so much so that he brought his toothbrush and the sayings of Buddha to court for the verdict. But when it came, which no doubt enraged the judge, he was found innocent. He immediately resigned from the Civil Service and weeks later published his first book, The Right To Know, then joining the politics and international relations department at Swansea University.The acquittal also enraged the Conservative-dominated Commons and, in , a new Official Secrets Act came into force, which removed the defence of acting in the public interest, on which Ponting had relied. Ponting was no archetypal rebel. After getting a First in history he joined the Civil Service and when Thatcher came to power in , he led a team identying savings which the MoD could make, showing how the military could save millions on stock and food supply costs, and questioning whether the armed forces needed , full-time bandsmen. Thatcher praised him in Cabinet, laughed at his jokes and put him forward for an OBE.As an academic he was a prolic, somewhat controversial, revisionist historian.His  biography of Winston Churchill depicted him as a racist who, among other measures, wanted to forcibly sterilise the ldquomentally degenerate and send tens of thousands of Britons to labour camps.One reviewer said of the book: ldquoPonting shattered the Churchill illusion for his readers, leaving them little to piece together, just marble shards on the floor of his looted temple.He retired in  and after the  Brexit vote moved with his we to Kelso where, on July  this year, he died."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-2020-sources-suggest-castle-wales-new-location","story":"Eager Scots fans had hoped the show, which is moving to the UK for the first time in its -year history, would be filmed north of the border.It was confirmed this week that the th season would be filmed in a ruined castle, and eyes immediately turned to the host of buildings across Scotland that could perhaps be eligible.But it looks as though the show will not be taking to the likes of Eileen Dornan Castle or Doune Castle- after sourcessuggested it will be filmed within the grounds of -year-old Gwrych Castle folly in North Wales.:Five Scottish castles that could have beenused for UK seriesLocal legends suggest the castle ruins are stalked by the ghost of its past owner, Winred Cochrane, the Countess of Dundonald, who died in .This is perhaps where the only Scottish connection with the location comes forth.

Most have had new outbreaks. The exceptions are Taiwan, Mongolia, Fiji and New Zealand.Australia adopted very similar responses to the pandemic and it is important to note that most states and territories are in the same position as New Zealand. But Victoria and, to a lesser extent, New South Wales are seeing a signicant resurgence.The key dference is that New Zealand committed relatively early to a clearly articulated elimination strategy and pursued it aggressively. An intense lockdown proved highly effective at rapidly extinguishing the virus.This dference can be seen graphically in this stringency index published by Oxford Universityrsquos Our World in Data.There are key lessons from New Zealandrsquos COVID- experience.Total all-cause deaths also dropped during the lockdown. This observation suggests it did not have severe negative effects on health, although it will almost certainly have some negative long-term effects.We have gained a much better understanding of COVID- over the past eight months. Without effective control measures, it is likely to continue to spread globally for many months to years, ultimately infecting billions and killing millions. The proportion of infected people who die appears to be slightly below %.This infection also causes serious long-term consequences for some survivors. The largest uncertainties involve immunity to this virus, whether it can develop from exposure to infection or vaccines, andit is long-lasting. The potential for treatment with antivirals and other therapeutics is also still uncertain.This knowledge reinforces the huge benefits of sustaining elimination. We know thatNew Zealand were to experience widespread COVID- transmission, the impact on M#ori and Pasika populations could be catastrophic.We have previously described critical measures to get us through this period, including the use of fabric face masks, improving contact tracing with suitable digital tools, applying a science-based approach to border management, and the need for a dedicated national public health agency.Maintaining elimination depends on adopting a highly strategic approach to risk management. This approach involves choosing an optimal mix of interventions and using resources in the most efficient way to keep the risk of COVID- outbreaks at a consistently low level. Several measures can contribute to this goal over the next few months, while also allowing incremental increases in international travel:New Zealand cannot change the reality of the global COVID- pandemic. But it can leverage possible benefits.We should conduct an official inquiry into the COVID- response so we learn everything we possibly can to improve our response capacity for future events.We also need to establish a specialised national public health agency to manage serious threats to public health and provide critical mass to advance public health generally. Such an agency appears to have been a key factor in the success of Taiwan, which avoided a costly lockdown entirely.Business as usual should not be an option for the recovery phase.

The village of Dounby is only slightly older.The story begins with Hosen Market, which was held three times a year at Geoth, north-east of the present village. According to my grandmother, Johina Leith, nee Kirkness, who was born at nearby Newhouse in , and wrote some notes on Dounby, the market began at Hosen in Birsay but drted across the parish boundary to Magz o’Geoth’s ale-house.Grandma was told that, after Magz gave up her ale-house, JosephMackay, who had built the Smithfield Inn, was responsible for the market’s next move.“It would be good for business to have the market near the ale house, so Josie marshalled public opinion into taking up a public subscription to buy a stance nearby with proper title deeds. According to George Wylie, in his book, Showyard on the Heather, , the subscription to buy the land was raised in . But Josie and the market had arrived on that spot almost simultaneously, four years earlier.The West Mainland Agricultural Society was formed in . Two years later, they advertised a Cattle Tryst at Dounby, “for the dispersal of the Best Fat and Grazing Stock of the district.New roads and steamships meant that farmers could export and Dounby Farm, between the main Harray and Birsay road and the new junction road through Sandwick, was the obvious place to sell animals.  is also the year that Josie bought land at the junction from Magnus Smith, owner of Dounby Farm, and built his inn. He married Margaret Davie from Firth in  and by the following year, according to the Orcadian, inn and market were thriving.“The market stance at Dounby, it is believed, is the best in the mainland… It is central and easy of access from all quarters, being held at the intersection of two roads. There is a good and commodious inn on the ground, conducted in a superior manner by Mr and Mrs Mackay, where a iety of refreshments can be had and a rest enjoyed. Sometime in the s, Josie built the larger Smithfield, which held the inn, the Post Office and one or two other businesses over the years. Grandma thought that it was probably the Post Office who fixed the name of Dounby Farm onto the village. It was certainly settled by , when the Dounby Public School opened.The first Dounby Show was held on a field loaned by William Hourie, tenant of Dounby Farm and was a great success. There were over  entries and more than  spectators. I was amazed to find that my g-g-grandfather, Robert Leask of Coldomo, Stenness was one of the prize-winners. It must have been quite an operation to get the animals to the Show then. Grandma had fond memories of the days before cattle trucks.“At one time it was interesting to watch the animals come up from Dounby, past the corner and then turn for Harray, Birsay or Evie, each with their tickets on. At the dinner in the Smithfield Hotel on the evening of the first Show, it was suggested that there should be a Flower and Produce Show and it was held in the Dounby School just six weeks later. After that first year, the two shows were on the same day and the crowds flocked to Dounby.The stock show was held on Dounby Farm until the Society bought five acres of uncultivated land from James Flett of Curcabreck in  and built a wall around it.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

through the system, the head of the admissions service has predicted.School leavers who have had their gap year plans disrupted by Covid- will be among those who choose to bypass the main application scheme in favour of searching for a course through clearing, Ucas said.With less than a week to go until students receive their A-level results, nearly three in four of the UKrsquos top institutions have vacancies on their undergraduate programmes on the clearing website.Clare Marchant, Ucasrsquos chief executive, believes as many as , applicants could find a place via clearing, up from , last year, despite fears about the impact of Covid- on the student experience.More than , courses at the elite Russell Group universities still have spaces for students in England via the clearing process, according to a recent analysis by the PA news agency.Ms Marchant said it was a ldquogood year for prospective students in Britain who wanted to attend university in the autumn as institutions will be competing to fill their courses at a time of uncertainty.The ldquofragile situation, where the number of overseas students could fall amid Covid-, alongside the fact there are fewer -year-olds in the population, plays to UK ldquostudentsrsquo strengths, she told PA.ldquoI think we will end up with signicant numbers through clearing, Ms Marchant said.ldquoI think itrsquos going to be probably the busiest yet.Clearing has become an increasingly popular route to securing a university place in recent years, in part due to reforms that lted the cap on the number of students universities could recruit.It is also used by students who may have changed their mind about their course or university and want to find somewhere new, or those who have done better than expected and want to trade places.This summer, Ms Marchant expects to see students whose gap year plans have been affected by travel restrictions due to the pandemic ndash or students who had planned to do year-long internships before starting higher education ndash also applying directly through clearing for a university place for this autumn.The National Careers @exam_helpline will be back once again with free, impartial advice and guidance on dferent choices available to you.To find more: https:t.co TUnnJIzemdash UCASAugust , ldquoI am expecting there to be a number of those, the Ucas boss said.ldquo lsquoIrsquom not going to defer, or Irsquom going to come in for the very first timersquo.A number of top universities, including Warwick, Bristol and Sheffield, said they have already heard from applicants ndash who were due to start in  after a gap year ndash requesting to start the course this autumn instead.But Ms Marchant admitted that more local lockdowns in the weeks to come could ldquoinfluence student choice ahead of enrolment in the autumn, as she added the situation was ldquoexceptionally fragile.An analysis, conducted by PA, shows that as of Friday evening, for applicants living in England, there were , courses with availability across  UK universities and colleges.Seventeen of the  Russell Group universities had vacancies on courses for English residents ndash a total of , courses between them ndash on the Ucas clearing site ahead of results day on Thursday.The Russell Group universities which had the most courses available were Glasgow with , Southampton with  and Liverpool with .A-level students had their exams cancelled this summer due to Covid-.Instead, schools and colleges were asked to submit the grades they thought students would have receivedthey had sat the exams.Exam boards have moderated the grades ndash which students receive on Thursday ndash to ensure this yearrsquos results are not signicantly higher than previous years and the value of studentsrsquo grades are not undermined.Last week, Mike Nicholson, director of student recruitment and admissions at the University of Bath, told Times Higher Education magazine that universities could have less wiggle room this year to admit students who see their predicted A-level results downgraded and who miss out on places.Student number controls ndash and a lack of accommodation or classroom space to comply with social distancing ndash may be barriers to admitting students who fail to meet their offers, Mr Nicholson warned.Universities in England are only allowed to recruit % more UK students than their targets this year to prevent institutions from over-recruiting to make up for lost revenue as a result of Covid-.But Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute , believes it is a good time for British students to apply ndash despite the cap on places and the ldquocontroversies over exam results.He said: ldquoA big second wave would obviously be a disaster for universities and students but I am clear in my own mind that ndashI were  this year ndash I would be planning on going this year, in part because the alternatives are so ropey.ldquoThe biggest challenge for universities, therefore, may not be recruitment but retention after students have arrived on campus.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

can sign up for further information about the scheme from today, before it becomes operational in September.A £ million investment will fund the development of new technology to ensure the process can be fully digital and streamlined.The measures are needed because the Northern Ireland protocol requires it to remain in alignment with EU rules on goods, effectively creating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea from January  after the transition period ends.That means that digital import and safety and security declarations will be needed to avoid tarfs on trade within the UK and that goods destined for Ireland or the EU pay tarfs when they should.The Trader Support Service will take care of those on businesses’ behalf at no cost, with officials indicating it should be seen as an enduring commitment rather than a short-term fix.The new service is outlined as part of the publication of new guidance on the protocol for businesses moving goods into and from Northern Ireland.Further support could be provided to cover health certication requirements for agroods.Separately, a further £ million has been committed to the Peace Plus programme to support reconciliation projects across the island of Ireland from -.Mr Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis will promote the package during a joint visit.“Today’s £ million investment underlines our absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period,” Mr Gove said.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £ million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the BelfastAgreement.“As part of our ongoing engagement with Northern Ireland businesses and the executive, we are also publishing further guidance for businesses on the operation of the protocol.“As we continue to engage with businesses and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period.”Mr Lewis, said: “Businesses have always been at the heart of our preparations for the end of the transition period.“This new Trader Support Service backed by funding of up to £ million reinforces this approach – it is a unique service that will ensure that

The BBC is a  for engagement and debate, but ideas which fall outside the scientic mainstream should be scrutinised and challenged, which did not happen in this instance.A letter of apology was also issued by BBC Northern Ireland#s head of news, Adam Smyth, in response to the complaint.In the letter, Mr Smyth said the BBC#s editorial guidelines in this area have been reinforced with news teams.Newcastle was the scene of a major Covid- cluster in recent days.Three businesses in the town reported outbreaks of the virus among staff this week.One of the businesses Kent Amusements, located on the Central Promenade, announced on social media it was closing until further notice.A Covid- testing unit has been opened at St Mary#s Primary School in Newcastle.Local Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard welcomed the move.He said: I am encouraging anyone in the Newcastle area who has developed COVID- symptoms to avoid contact with others and to urgently get tested for the virus.

But most of all we need the public to support our industry.Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industryhas set our six ways of coping in the event of a local lockdown.The organisation#s Northern Ireland director Angela McGowan it#s about building confidencenew temporary restrictions are implemented.Businesses know thatinfection rates spike in an area then new local lockdowns may well be required to protect public health, she said.Local lockdowns are how governments manage the risk of infection and reopening the economy safely, so we must get good at them. The local Executive will need to act fast on new information, so there may be limited notice, but we must aim for a #no surprises# approach as far as possible.

And in  the Belfastlaunched its morning AM edition in tabloid format. Thebecame fully tabloid size on March , . Today it is Northern Ireland#s most popular newspaper - with millions reading both online and print editions. Fty years ago, to mark our centenary the Tele ran ‘The Kind of Ulster I Want’ competition. The young people of Northern Ireland in  were invited to pen a short essay detailing their hopes and dreams for peace and harmony in the future - and what NI would look like in the future.. At the time, -year-old Valerie McCambley, winner of second prize in the - age group, won a £ voucher which she said she would be putting towards a trip abroad with school the following year. “We must realise now before it is too late, that we are tomorrow’s Ulster,” wrote Valerie. “We must affirm that  is now for our history books, but  is for us.”Meanwhile, Jeffrey Nelson, from Belfast, wrote that he “would like to see Ulster full of happy people who have nice homes and who live in peace with their neighbours”.He said he was going to buy an Action Man with “real hair” with his £ consolation voucher. As we gear up to celebrate  years of publication, the Belfastwould love to hear from those past competition winners to find out what they make of Ulster in  - how they ended up spending their voucher.

You must also wear a face covering on public transport.Q: Will I be fined or punishedI don’t comply A: In theory yes, in practice it is highly unlikely. It is unclear who —anyone — will enforce the new regulations.The Department of Health said: “The Northern Ireland Executive expects that people who are able to wear a face covering will do so in order to help protect themselves and others but breaches of the requirement could attract a fixed penalty notice of £ . The amount of a fixed penalty notice increasesthere are further offences.”But the PSNI has said its officers will not enforce the wearing of masks, but will “engage, explain and encourage people to make the right choices”.Wearing a face covering has been mandatory on public transport for almost a month, but to date no fines have been issued. It is also unclearthe PSNI has even spoken to anyone about non-compliance.Retail unions have said their members will not enforce the rule. Major retailers in England and Scotland, where the regulations are already in place, have not challenged shoppers either.Q: What should I do when I see people not wearing face coverings A: Nothing. Official guidance urges shoppers not to challenge anyone who does not cover up. It states: “It is important that we all respect one another and remember that the reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible.”Q: Who does not have to wear a face mask A: Exemptions includeyou are under the age of ,you are a member of staff or employee of the shop or shopping centre, temporarilya member of staff or employee or a police officer asks you to remove it to check your identity,you have a reasonable excuse not to.Q: What is a reasonable excuse A: Guidelines outline a range of circumstances where people may have a ‘reasonable excuse’ not to wear a face covering in a shop or shopping centre, such asit is distressing or you have a relevant medical condition.These include:* If you need to seek medical assistance or to provide care to someone who needs assistance, such as a vulnerable person or in an emergency* If you need to avoid injury, illness or escape from harm* If you have a physical or mental illness or impairment, or a disability that means you cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering* If putting on, wearing or removing a face covering would cause you severe distress* If you are travelling with, or providing assistance to, someone who relies on lip reading to communicate* If you need to remove it to avoid harm or injury or the risk of harm or injury to yourself or others* If you need to eat, drink, or take medication* If you are asked to remove your face covering by a police officer or other official.Q: WhatI cannot wear a face covering A: There is no need to get a letter from a doctor or the government to show that you do not need to wear a face covering. If you have a condition which means you cannot wear a face covering you only need to say,asked, that you cannot wear a face covering because you are exempt.Q: What is a face covering Any type which covers your nose and mouth. You should use a reusable, cloth face coveringpossible to help protect the environment. Emerging evidence suggests that the risk of transmission may be reduced by using thicker fabrics or multiple layers but it should still be breathable. A vent is not recommended. Masks with valves allow air breathed out to pass unfiltered into the environment, along with potential droplets, defeating the key purpose of protecting those around you.Q: Why do I need to cover up A: Covid- usually spreads by droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking. These droplets can also be picked up from surfaces,you touch a surface and then your face without washing your hands first. The Department of Health says the best available scientic evidence is that, when used correctly, wearing a face covering may reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets in certain circumstances, helping to protect others.Q: Will a face mask protect me A: Official advice states that face coverings are mainly intended to protect others, not the wearer, from Covid-. The Department of Health says they are not a replacement for social distancing and regular hand washing. It warns people not to get a  sense of security about the level of protection they may offer.Q: Where should I wear a face covering A: From Monday, it is mandatory to wear a face covering in “a relevant place”, which the Department of Health defines as generally meaning “a shop or shopping centre”.It adds: “As well as ordinary day to day shopping for items such as clothes, food or electrical goods, a face covering is required in any other indoor place where goods or services are available to buy or rent. This includes, for example, a bookmakers, a food takeaway business or a dry cleaner.”Q: Where do I not need to wear a face covering A: It is not mandatory to wear a face covering in a business that is able to maintain social distancing by using a system of ticketing or appointments. This might include, for example, a cinema, a hairdresser or a solicitor.You do not have to wear a face covering in a bank or a business that operates like a bank.Department of Health guidance accepts there are circumstances where it is not possible to wear a face covering.These include:* Where you are eating or drinking in a restaurant, pub or café. * If you are a customer of a food takeaway business, or a shop that sells food or drink for immediate consumption, and it provides seating for its customers, you may remove your face covering while eating and drinking at those seats.* You do not have to wear a face covering in a gym or other place where the purpose of your attendance is aerobic exercise.

He was awarded the Nobel peace prize, with the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble.Respect and admiration for Mr Hume stretched far beyond his home city, spanning both communities.On Wednesday it brought dignitaries from across Ireland to St Eugene#s Cathedral, including Irish president Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach Micheal Martin, the First and deputy First Ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill, and Secretary of State, Brandon Lewis. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood led a delegation of party figures past and present, including veterans Dr Joe Hendron, Alban Maginness, Brid Rodgers and Austin Currie. More contemporary figures were Claire Hanna, Nicola Mallon and Mark H Durkan.Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others Fr Paul FarrenFr Farren said the path towards peace was not easy for Mr Hume. The priest spoke of his compassion, referring to how he comforted families bereaved in the  Greysteel massacre.In a time in our world when often small mindedness and self-focus seems to be the driver, John never put anybody or any specic group first. He put everybody first, he added.He didn#t focus on dference and ision. He focused on unity and peace and giving that dignity to every person.

It was compassion - a compassion that bubbled over in the cemetery in Greysteel that drove John on the final and often lonely and always dficult road to peace.Fr Farren said this desire to create peace came at a heavy cost.He added: Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others. His vision revealed what could be and with time and determination and single-mindedness and stubbornness he convinced others that peace could be a reality. He never lost faith in peace and he never lost faith in his ability to convince others that peace was the only way.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added. The university campaign acted as a prelude to the civil rights movement and was part of a building of frustrations felt by Derry people. Ultimately the protest had no impact on the final decision but it may have saved Magee campus, which had been earmarked for closure. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann, civil rights veteran and former neighbour of Hume, believes it was the university campaign that set the tone for the former SDLP leader’s style of politics in the decades to come. At this stage people will be familiar with the motorcade to Stormont in protest over Lockwoods decision, he added. But he says, as signicant, was a Guildhall Square rally ‘jammed with people’ where a youthful John Hume spoke not of ‘unionist discrimination’ but of the need for ‘togetherness’ to bring about reform. “There really you have the microcosm of his politics and strategy for the rest of his le, it was all there.” In  a Peace and Conflict Studies course was formed at the Magee campus in Derry, an internationally renowned programme offered by leading academics from the International Conflict Research Institute . In recognition of Hume’s peace-building efforts, Ulster University announced funding for the John Hume and Thomas P. ONeill Chair in Peace, to be established at the Magee campus. Set up in honour of both politicians, the Chair is a full-time academic position in peace and conflict resolution studies which helps to train the next generation of peacemakers from around the world. Presidents and leaders from around the world, including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, spoke to audiences at the campus. However, there was widespread concern in Derry when a decision was made to relocate the course to Belfast a number of years ago. ‘JOHN’S VISION’ Current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that throughout his le, John Hume stood up for Derry and all its people. “He understood the transformative impact of education and knew all too well the structural inequalities forced upon the people of this city,” he said. “John campaigned for university provision in Derry that could deliver the skills and opportunities our people need to grow and prosper, even against the backdrop of a campaign of violence that plagued the lives of those in the city. “Delivering on John’s vision for Derry is a priority for me and for the SDLP. I am committed to ensuring that everyone in this city has the opportunity to make a live for themselves here. “Johns lasting legacy should be that we never allow our young people to be raised for export. Derry needs a full-scale university, nothing  will meet the needs of our people.” Meanwhile, the Derry University Groupwhich has been lobbying for an independent university in the city described John Hume as one of the greatest educators and thinkers the city has known since Colmcille. GarbhaacutenDowney of the DUG said: “He taught us of the importance of a university as a centre of learning, industry, science and arts, heritage, philosophy and discourse as the focal point for community engagement, and the lead agent for positive change and self-empowerment “He worked throughout his career to establish a university here to serve as the bedrock for the new, peaceful society of equals, which he had envisaged for Derry from his earliest days as a social champion. “The campaign to build a university, begun by John Hume sixty years ago, is still unfinished. It has been described as the last remaining civil rights issue. “There could be no more fitting legacy to John Hume than for his home city to finish this job now.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said concerns had been raised by constituents whose requests for their license renewals to be issued in Irish were not honoured. “The right to have your details printed in Irish on your licence is protected within the European Charter for Regional and Minority languages,” she said. “Following the commitment to an Irish Language Act within New Decade, New Approach, I would have hoped that the use of Irish on official documents would be encouraged within agencies, as opposed to prevented. googletag.cmd.push “I was contacted by a family who had applied for their licence renewals to reflect their fluency in the language, and to have their names and addresses in Irish on their Photographic licences, and was concerned that their demand had not been acted upon by DVA staff. “A driving licence, like any official ID, is often a source of pride and an opportunity to express ourselves. “It is therefore key that citizens have their identity expressed as they wish on theirlicence, not as another would interpret it.” The Department of Infrastructure has confirmed applicants may request their name in Irish on their license. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson said: “An applicant for, or holder of, a Northern Ireland driving licence may, at any time, request that their name appears in traditional form. “Such a request does not constitute a change of name and the applicant or holder is not required to provide identity documentation bearing the name in Irish. “Where an applicant for, or holder of, a Northern Ireland driving licence requests that the address is displayed in Irish, such a request will be met provided the relevant council confirms that the street name has been legally adopted. “Currently this does not extend to other addresses.It was agreed in New Decade New Approach that the Executive Office would bring forward language legislation and appoint a Commissioner to protect and enhance use of the Irish language. “It is important that this legislation is brought forward as soon as possible, and I will seek to ensure that my department plays its role and fulfils its commitments.” Ms Sheerin welcomed the Department’s response and clarication. She said: “I am delighted that the minister has written to me to confirm that this was an error, and that the department understand it is a persons right to have their name printed in Irish. “Where their council has a street sign policy in place which has legally adopted their street or road into Irish, they are entitled to have their address displayed as such.” Ms Sheerin also confirmed the constituents had now received their licenses with their names printed in Irish.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A delivery van was hijacked at Rathlin Drive in the estate on Tuesday afternoon before being set on fire. It was one of three vehicles hijacked in Derry on Tuesday. Local politicians condemned the hijackings and said they had destroyed the livelihoods of the workers involved. Community workers today said there were widespread concerns about the attacks in Creggan this week. In a joint statement, Conal McFeely, Tony O’Doherty, Shauna Deery and Gerry Quinn of Creggan Neighbourhood Partnershipsaid there were also concerns about police activity in Creggan which included, they said, house raids, stop and search tactics and other disruption activity by the TSG   TIU . googletag.cmd.push “We, as the community, need to listen and to speak out, to ensure that everyone fully understands the negative consequences of such events and the social, economic and reputational damage to iniduals, families and the wider community,” the statement said. “Creggan has been fully compliant to public health guidance, and extremely resilient and considerate during the Covid lockdown – an exemplar in how a community should respond to a crisis. “According to current statistics, this area has among the lowest reported crime figures in the city and, contrary to the widely-reported, albeit ill-informed, perception, Creggan is in fact a very safe and caring community. googletag.cmd.push “The last number of weeks, however, have seen a number of serious incidents which we believe require further investigation. “CNP believe there is an underlying context to this week’s disturbances, which has gone largely unreported and hence has, again, led to a very one-sided picture of this area being portrayed.” The community workers said young people and families had told them that they are being deliberately targeted by highly aggressive, frightening and quasi-legal policing procedures tactics. “And it is incumbent on us, as a socially-just community, to take account of all available evidence, to establish a full and fair perspective of the situation. “CNP in no way condone or excuse the activities leading to the physical, mental and reputational damage done by, or to, any person or property in this community. “We are aware, however, that there is a specic context to recent events – this response did not happen out of nowhere. “And we also believe that there is a responsibility on all of us to examine that context and engage with young people and local residents – both to listen to their concerns and to ensure that they understand the extremely negative consequences of the destruction of community or private property, and the knock-on affects in relation to the traumatic impacts on affected iniduals and the denial of public services to the area. “There is a growing concern about the ‘cause and effect’ nature of ongoing police activity in the area and recent community disturbances. “Many within this community believe that current police actions only serve to undermine public confidence in policing and indeed the independence and effectiveness of the local and regional police oversight bodies which are supposed to hold police to account. “Our public representatives and church leaders should be concerned, and not be afraid to speak out, about how our area is being policed and is being impacted by the resulting destruction of community or private property.” The Creggan community workers said that following a process of mediation with relevant groupings, it has been established that there is no impediment to the resumption of all delivery and maintenance services in the area. “Tensions are high in the area at the moment – there is a great deal of hurt and frustration which needs to be acknowledged and the specic reasons for these sentiments need to be explored. “CNP believe there is a critical need for an independent review of the recent disturbances – and their context – and will engage inclusively with the entire community to ensure that any such process will be as fair and transparent as possible.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The league leaders were in danger of dropping their first points of the season after Walter Figuiras first half goal had given the Candystripes the lead, but an own goal from Colm Horgan and a follow up from Roberto Lopes maintained the % record this season. Derry kept their shape throughout an uneventful first half, with Rovers bossing possession, but without ever really causing a threat, a half chance for Danny Lafferty, on histo the Brandywell, the only effort Rovers had in the first half hour. googletag.cmd.push The first half was drting uneventfully towards half time when the first goal arrived out of absolutely nowhere. Eoin Toal collected the ball on half way and decided to join the attack, bursting between two Rovers players before finding Walter Figueira on the left wing. Toal continued into the penalty area in anticipation of a cross, which was duly delivered, but incredibly, the ball eluded both Roberto Lopes and Alan Mannus with the ball sneaking into the net past the bemused Rovers players. Stephen Bradley was far from happy with his teams inability to test Peter Cherrie and midway through the second half he had used all of his substitutes to completely change the look of his attack. googletag.cmd.push Those substitutions had the desired effect as Rovers finally levelled on  minutes, but there was still an element of luck about the goal. Gaffney did well to pick out a cross from the right and a glancing header by Williams went over Cherrie but onto the post before it bounced off the unfortunate Colm Horgan and into the net. Rovers were relentless after that, and, buoyed by the goal, they went in search of a winner, and they thought they had it when Farrugia went in from the left and picked out Williams, but he was denied from close range by a superb save by Peter Cherrie. But the goal was coming and City were unable to defend the resulting short corner, Burke receiving the ball in the area before sending it into the mix where Lopes was on hand to fire it past Cherrie to turn the game completely on its head with just eight minutes remaining. There was a chance late on for a City equaliser when Ciaron Harkin and Colm Horgan combined to set up Figueira, but his effort was too close to Mannus who gathered comfortably. City continued to push in five minutes of added time and they came so close to levelling when Adam Hamills cross was met brilliantly by Harkin who headed onto the crossbar before Mannus somehow kept out Toals follow-up.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

Photo: Press Eye PA WireThe scale of support required to help firms deal with the paperwork is testament to how serious the barriers to trade and business will become now that Northern Ireland is to be left behind as a colony of the EU, semi-detached from the rest of the nation.As for Mr Gove’s claims that this package underscores Westminster’s “absolute commitment” to Northern Ireland those who heard him and other members of the government loudly and repeatedly deny that an Irish Sea border would ever be accepted will understandably treat the comments with contempt.Yesterday’s announcement is bad news for everyone in Northern Ireland. Regardless of your stance on the constitutional question, the erection of a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain means you will be hit in the pocket in the months and years ahead.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It makes no economic sense. Far from yesterday’s announcement displaying a commitment to Northern Ireland it underscores a historic betrayal of this part of the United Kingdom.The fact that the DUP DAERA minister, despite his previous affirmations to the contrary, is now overseeing the imposition of the Irish Sea Border infrastructure at our ports, adds to the sense of betrayal that I as a unionist feel.The evaporation of opposition to the Betrayal Act by those in a position to take a stand, through the governmental positions they hold, is a great disappointment and disservice to future generations.Just last week we saw north southery turbocharged while the wedge of an Irish Sea border Is driven through the east west links. Arlene Foster declared her sanguinity to the Dublin government’s ‘shared island unit’ while the Republic’s Prime Minister made clear today its purpose is to anticipate a break-up of the UK. History, from a unionist perspective, will not judge kindly those at both a national and local level who facilitated and whitewashed the catastrophic consequences of the Betrayal Act.Jim Allister QC MLA, Stormont——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySchool leavers who have had their gap year plans disrupted by Covid- will be among those who choose to bypass the main application scheme in favour of searching for a course through clearing, Ucas said.With less than a week to go until students receive their A-level results, nearly three in four of the UKrsquos top institutions have vacancies on their undergraduate programmes on the clearing website.Clare Marchant, Ucasrsquos chief executive, believes as many as , applicants could find a place via clearing, up from , last year, despite fears about the impact of Covid- on the student experience.More than , courses at the elite Russell Group universities still have spaces for students in England via the clearing process, according to a recent analysis by the PA news agency.Ms Marchant said it was a ldquogood year for prospective students in Britain who wanted to attend university in the autumn as institutions will be competing to fill their courses at a time of uncertainty.The ldquofragile situation, where the number of overseas students could fall amid Covid-, alongside the fact there are fewer -year-olds in the population, plays to UK ldquostudentsrsquo strengths, she told PA.ldquoI think we will end up with signicant numbers through clearing, Ms Marchant said.ldquoI think itrsquos going to be probably the busiest yet.Clearing has become an increasingly popular route to securing a university place in recent years, in part due to reforms that lted the cap on the number of students universities could recruit.It is also used by students who may have changed their mind about their course or university and want to find somewhere new, or those who have done better than expected and want to trade places.This summer, Ms Marchant expects to see students whose gap year plans have been affected by travel restrictions due to the pandemic ndash or students who had planned to do year-long internships before starting higher education ndash also applying directly through clearing for a university place for this autumn.The National Careers @exam_helpline will be back once

said.ldquo lsquoIrsquom not going to defer, or Irsquom going to come in for the very first timersquo.A number of top universities, including Warwick, Bristol and Sheffield, said they have already heard from applicants ndash who were due to start in  after a gap year ndash requesting to start the course this autumn instead.But Ms Marchant admitted that more local lockdowns in the weeks to come could ldquoinfluence student choice ahead of enrolment in the autumn, as she added the situation was ldquoexceptionally fragile.An analysis, conducted by PA, shows that as of Friday evening, for applicants living in England, there were , courses with availability across  UK universities and colleges.Seventeen of the  Russell Group universities had vacancies on courses for English residents ndash a total of , courses between them ndash on the Ucas clearing site ahead of results day on Thursday.The Russell Group universities which had the most courses available were Glasgow with , Southampton with  and Liverpool with .A-level students had their exams cancelled this summer due to Covid-.Instead, schools and colleges were asked to submit the grades they thought students would have receivedthey had sat the exams.Exam boards have moderated the grades ndash which students receive on Thursday ndash to ensure this yearrsquos results are not signicantly higher than previous years and the value of studentsrsquo grades are not undermined.Last week, Mike Nicholson, director of student recruitment and admissions at the University of Bath, told Times Higher Education magazine that universities could have less wiggle room this year to admit students who see their predicted A-level results downgraded and who miss out on places.Student number controls ndash and a lack of accommodation or classroom space to comply with social distancing ndash may be barriers to admitting students who fail to meet their offers, Mr Nicholson warned.Universities in England are only allowed to recruit % more UK students than their targets this year to prevent institutions from over-recruiting to make up for lost revenue as a result of Covid-.But Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute , believes it is a good time for British students to apply ndash despite the cap on places and the ldquocontroversies over exam results.He said: ldquoA big second wave would obviously be a disaster for universities and students but I am clear in my own mind that ndashI were  this year ndash I would be planning on going this year, in part because the alternatives are so ropey.ldquoThe biggest challenge for universities, therefore, may not be recruitment but retention after students have arrived on campus..push,i[r].l*new

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles. The council hopes the new leisure centre will welcome visitors from across the borough and beyond to its new -metre pool, a young children’s indoor leisure water feature, a ,m state-of-the-art gym, multiple studios, health and wellbeing suite, sensory room, eight-court sports halls, spin studio, soft play area and an on-site café.It also incorporates an outdoor water sports provision offering a wide range of water based activities including windsurfing, water skiing and paddle sports.

TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsNew store and  jobs in pipelineA major new chain store is on its way to Lurgan and could bring  jobs to the town, a local councillor has said.By The NewsroomFriday, th August , : pmUpdated Friday, th August , : pm\"\"The application, lodged by applicant Inaltus Ltd on behalf of Curly Properties Ltd is for a retail development with car parking, landscaping, access and associated site works developed atvacant lands north of Millennium Way, Lurgan.Originally submitted in  the planning proposal has been recommended for approval by Council’s planning officers and will,approved, see Home Bargains arrive in town.Speaking in support of the application, Councillor Joe Nelson said it would bring “signicant economic benefits… including some  new jobs” to Lurgan.“I believe the site location is ideal for this development as it provides adequate car parking in situ and is located on Millenium Way which is in fact the relief road for Lurgan Town Centre,” say the SDLP councillor.“Bringing this development to the town while keeping the town centre free from extra congestion is the ideal position.“I strongly support these proposals and trust that the material considerations, associated with the economic and other benefits of the scheme, will be considered in detail by the Council planners.”Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley has expressed “strong support” for the application.“The proposals will see the delivery of a Home Bargains store for Lurgan along with signicant economic benefits including a multi-million pound investment into the local economy and the creation of some  new jobs,” said the DUP MLA“At a time when many people are losing their jobs and many businesses are having to close, proposal such as this, where successful major retailingbusinesses are willing to commit to Lurgan, the Council must give very serious consideration to these proposals.”However, an independentreview of the application by Tom Stokes Associated Planning expressed concerns that rather than support the town centre, the application,approved, is “more likely to create an alternative retail destination to the town centre”.The report said that with  per cent of the Lurgan town centre’s turnover allocated to just two stores, the remaining smaller conveniencestores in Lurgan could be “vulnerable to impact” by the approval of this application.The review also suggested that the proposal would be better suited to the former Tesco site in Castle Lane as it is “a key regeneration site in the town centre”.However, in response to this, the application’s agent, Inaltus Ltd, said: “If this site did not suit Tesco’s servicing requirements, there are no grounds for TSA to suggest it will suit Home Bargains.”In conclusion Inaltus Ltd’s response to TSA assessmentstates that whilst some aspects of the TSA Review can be agreed “other aspects are illogical and do not form a sound basis to refuse the proposal on”.It also notes that no objections have been lodged in over  months and called for the application to be brought before Council’s planning committee.The application is now set to appear before Wednesday’smeeting of the planning committee, with officer’s recommending that the application is approved.-------A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
