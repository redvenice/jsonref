But he found life hard.‘My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it’d be a better life,’ Raj says.         ‘My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it’d be a better life,’ Raj (pictured) saysIn 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben, and his three sons came to England. Raj recalls the moment he arrived as a teenager, speaking no English. ‘London was very beautiful and very clean. It was so different from our village in India, where we only had electricity for a couple of hours a day.’From the day he arrived in Thatcher’s Britain, Ashok worked as a grocer, initially with his brother in a corner shop in Tottenham, North London, before saving enough to open his own: Lena Stores in Islington, which he took over in 1998.Yes, the customers came to Lena Stores for groceries, but mostly for Old Mr Patel, who would dispense free lollipops to children and gossip to their parents and grandparents.The shop itself is tiny, about a quarter the size of a typical Tesco Express. The freezer cabinet filled with Magnum ice creams, bags of peas and (very good value) £1 garlic bread baguettes, has a handle held together with gaffer tape.The lino floor is scuffed. The superglue is stacked next to the Patak’s vindaloo sauce, and the balls of garden twine are shoved into a cardboard box along with large nail brushes, a shower mat and some 13-amp, three-way mains adapters.But amid this chaos lies a staggering array of food, drink and household essentials. It is a microcosm of all that is best — and surviving still — in Britain’s high streets.Not the Britain of self-service tills and chains selling vapid coffee.No, the Britain of quirky independent shops, run by dedicated, hard-working families who choose to open their doors and serve their customers — even when they are grieving.Napoleon may have meant it as an insult, but Britain still is a nation of shopkeepers — just. Nearly one in ten people in Britain works for a shop and the retail sector makes up five per cent of the British economy.         In 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben (pictured together), and his three sons came to EnglandOf course, most of our groceries are bought from one of the big four supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons. But there are thriving corner shops, despite all predictions they would be killed off by internet shopping and the march of the supermarkets.Of the 46,388 convenience stores in Britain, about 33,000, or nearly three-quarters, are independent, according to the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS). That number has fallen in the past few years, but not dramatically so.‘About 15 years ago, all the prophecies were that there would be no more independents left. That’s definitely not happened,’ says James Lowman, ACS chief executive.True, more and more convenience shops are now owned by a big supermarket chain. ‘But it’s a very slow move,’ Lowman adds. ‘The best shops in Britain are still run by independent shopkeepers, who are close to their customers.’And few were closer to their customers than Ashok Patel. After he died — he was fully diagnosed with cancer only last month — a tribute was posted on a local online message board and it triggered an outpouring of grief that was immediate and heartfelt, giving lie to the idea that there is no sense of community in inner-city London.The residents felt they had lost not just a local shopkeeper but a pillar of the community.One, Emily Grazebrook, said: ‘When I first moved to the area ten years ago, my husband and I had very little money, as we had put it all down as a deposit for a flat.‘I went into Lena and asked if they would take a cheque for some groceries. Ashok and Raj welcomed me to the neighbourhood and told me to put my cheque book away — I could pay them when money came in the following week. I was so moved by their kindness.’         When I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. ‘We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,’ Raj tells meThat struck a chord with me. If I ever nipped out to get some vital missing ingredient and then found I’d forgotten my wallet, Old Mr Patel always told me I could pay him later. He never kept a tally of all the credit he trusted that you’d remember — which I would sometimes do, with a pang of embarrassment, only days later.When we moved into the street, my eldest child was just six, my youngest not born.But all four of my children have taken their first crucial steps to independence by being sent to the end of the road to buy cereal or a loaf of bread, knowing Mr Patel would help them find the item and count out the correct change. They were always safe there.When I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. ‘We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,’ Raj tells me. ‘And we have seen so many grow up. When they first arrive, we can’t see them from this side of the counter.’Toddlers barely able to peer above the rack of Kit Kats and Lion bars, but soon old enough to buy stationery or their first can of beer before going off to university.‘Many of the naughty teenagers who have caused trouble grow up and come in later to apologise to us,’ he adds. But there was one incident when the youths were more than just naughty: they were dangerously violent.One December morning in 2012, three men, aged 25, 22 and 18, entered the shop, drunk, wielding knives and intent on stealing alcohol and anything else they could get their hands on. Ashok Patel was manning the shop on his own that day and he kept a baseball bat under the counter. ‘When the boys came, he fought back,’ recalls Raj. ‘I always said if he was ever threatened, he should just hand over the cash. It’s not worth it. But he always got so angry. He said: “I’ve been working long hours, seven days a week, I’m not going to give away my money.”’ And he didn’t.Then 63, he fought the three thugs, whom the judge later declared, when they were sentenced, ‘deliberately set out to commit a robbery on a vulnerable person’. At first, Ashok was successful, pushing them out the door. Then he slipped and the three youths returned, with one stabbing him in the head, another using the baseball bat to attack him.‘The blade was this close to his brain,’ his son says, holding his thumb and finger half an inch apart. He was left in a pool of his own blood, while the three stepped over him to steal beer, milk tokens and £220 in cash.Remarkably, Old Mr Patel was back behind the counter within a month, with his arm in a sling and his head bandaged like Mr Bump. He’d gladly show his scar to any customer.‘He was a very strong man,’ says his son. He certainly was.‘He just loved working in a shop,’ adds Raj sadly. ‘He loved meeting people and being part of the community.’The number of Gujarati shopkeepers in Britain is falling markedly — mostly because their children and grandchildren have little desire for the long hours and meagre rewards. Raj’s children, Keya, 24, and Jaimini, 22, both went to Brunel University. One is now a businesswoman, the younger training to be an accountant.‘My father was very proud of them,’ says Raj. ‘I’ve asked if they want to take on the shop, but they don’t want to.’It is easy to romanticise this first generation of immigrant shopkeepers, who worked all hours to make a better life for their families. But they are as much a part of Britain’s story as the coal miners, wheelwrights and lamp-lighters of previous generations.The majority of us no longer attend a parish church or a local butcher at whose counter we can gossip, but most still have a corner shop. If you’re lucky, it will be run by someone like Mr Patel.Only when they are gone will we understand how these shops and shopkeepers have helped weave the fabric of this country together. Run by families who kept the shutters up and the lights on, rather than cause an inconvenience. "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrew talk FBI oath friendship Jeffrey Epstein lawyer says","story":"Share this articlePrince Andrew must talk to the FBI about Jeffrey Epstein abuse, lawyer demands - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Pictured Man raised alarm family waiting end times Dutch house","story":"Share this article Creconat is associated with a timber company called Native Creative Economy, also based in Meppel, which is owned by Josef B, according to De Telegraaf. Police raided the premises on Monday, a neighbour said.

But now the revered museum is rebalancing its walls – massively boosting work by women and artists of colourIn his Poetics, Aristotle argued that poetry was a more scientific and serious genre than history. This was because, he said, history is concerned only with inidual and particular events. Poetry, on the other hand, is concerned with what might happen: that is, deep and general truths. In the newly revamped Museum of Modern Art in New York, which reopens on 21 October, the march of history, at least as it has been understood by MoMA in recent decades, is out and poetry is in.This lucid, but necessarily sealed-off, worldview has now been replaced with the kind of thematic approach familiar to British audiences from two decades of Tate Modern hangs. While still arranged according to a broad chronology, beginning with the 1880s on the fifth floor and descending to the present on the second, MoMA’s inidual rooms are organised around ideas, with titles such as War Within, War Without, Inner and Outer Space, and True Stories.The view of art history on show here is no longer one of straight lines and linear progressions, but one much more like the complex ripples set in motion by pebbles thrown into a pond. No longer will MoMA claim to tell a single story of modern and contemporary art. Every six months, the hang will substantially change.Some might say MoMA is letting itself off the hook: no definitive statements are made and everything is allowed to hover provisionally until the next remix. Lowry argues it is returning to the museum’s founding principles. The great first director, Alfred H Barr Jr, wrote: “Nothing that the visitors will see in the exhibition galleries, neither the works of art, nor the lighting fixtures, nor even the partitions, is at present permanent.”Barr understood, said Lowry, “that the museum was to be a work in progress, changing and evolving as the world of contemporary art changed and evolved”. The museum’s glaciation of its displays came later, in the 1960s and 70s, he said. Nevertheless, even in the brave indeterminate future, there will remain a few constants. Some works – Monet’s Water Lilies, Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon – will always be there. “We’d have a revolution if we took down the Water Lilies,” said Ann Temkin, chief curator of painting and sculpture, at a museum preview.Underlying the new mix-it-up approach is the argument that teleological art history – seeing the present as the logical culmination of the past – lacks contingency, fails to take into account the idea that once upon a time Cézanne, say, was just a bloke making strange paintings in the south of France, not an art history colossus whose work had a mind-blowing market value. So the new hang is not a “bang, bang, bang” of famous masterpiece after famous masterpiece, as Temkin phrased it. While we spoke, we were sitting with our backs to Cézanne’s The Bather, newly cleaned, with zingy blue details revealed of its background of rocks and water. To our right were Van Gogh’s Starry Night and Henri Rousseau’s The Dream. So far, so “bang, bang, bang”.But in a case in front of us was a selection of exquisite, earth-toned ceramics by American George Ohr, the self-styled “mad potter of Biloxi”. You could argue that these modest pots made in obscurity in Mississippi are irrelevant to the masterpieces of French post-impressionism. The point, according to Temkin, is to try to bring us back to around 1890 – when Van Gogh was painting in an asylum, Rousseau was collecting taxes, and no one knew what would be inscribed into the canon and what wouldn’t. Above all, she explained, the connections are visual. Gesturing at the warm-brown ceramics, she said: “You could almost make a Cézanne out of those colours.”Repudiating the Book of Genesis approach involves breaking up the patriarchal parade of white, male artists. So in a room titled Stamp, Scavenge, Crush – which centres on art using discarded or reused materials from the late 1940s to the early 60s, and features Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly – are also a photographic work by the African American Romare Bearden and a bedsheet printed by Ruth Asawa in 1948 with a stamp to create a dense, graphic pattern. This rebalancing has meant enlarging the collection – a process enabled by MoMA’s considerable resources and the tradition of American philanthropy along with its ability to sell off works in order to buy new ones. (British national museums’ constitutions prevent them from doing this.) Selling a Léger meant, Temkin explained, that the museum could purchase several works by “pioneering female modernists”. One, The Moon (1928), by Brazilian painter Tarsila do Amaral, acquired earlier this year, now holds court alongside Picasso, Brâncuși and Eileen Gray. Donations include the extraordinarily extensive and coherent Cisneros collection of Latin American art, which for the time being will be shown as a kind of museum-within-a-museum. A wall of shimmeringly delicate wire sculptures by the Venezuelan Gego are a particular joy.The labels beside works, specifically their date of acquisition, tell a story in themselves about recent innovations at MoMA. A wooden sculpture by Lebanon’s Saloua Raouda Choucair entered the collection last year. A set of works by Polish artist Edward Krasiński came in 2015. Ibrahim el-Salahi’s Prison Notebook, illustrated with ink drawings, made after he was wrongfully imprisoned in Sudan in 1975, was acquired in 2017. Despite its fragility and scale, it holds its own in a room themed around the conflicts of the 1970s opposite Philip Guston’s magisterial painting Deluge II, made at the same time. A dangling, curvaceous hemp sculpture by Indian artist Mrinalini Mukherjee was also acquired in 2017. Perhaps my eyes are drawn to familiar things, or perhaps it is just that curators in London and New York breathe the same air, but it strikes me that these last are all artists foregrounded by Tate Modern in current displays or recent exhibitions. At any rate, the message is loud and clear: the world is a big place, bigger than Manhattan and Paris – and great art is being made all around it.These themed rooms frequently draw on items from several of the institution’s mighty departments, creating a mix of, for example, photography, film, publications and painting. So for example, in the room with Asawa’s bedsheet there is a film of Merce Cunningham’s dance work Antic Meet – like a lot of film in the galleries, simply projected on to a wall, offered as part of the mix. One of the most rewarding moments in the current hang is a modest, unobtrusive room devoted to Frank O’Hara – from his manuscripts and early editions of books to artworks made by a host of greats to illustrate his work, and Larry Rivers’s portrait of the poet.All this has meant delving deep into the collection. Lowry said the museum had, to his eyes, become almost like two institutions in recent years – one that visitors had access to, and the other in store, where there was a much more varied and erse set of art. A work by the Indian painter VS Gaitonde, for example, was purchased in 1963, and languished unseen for years – now, though, it’s sharing wall space with Rothko. There is an entire case of radical zines and leaflets mailed to the museum in the early 1980s from Brazil – these items, from the Movimento de Arte Pornò, were unsought by the institution but dutifully catalogued and preserved.Some things, on the other hand, have been permanently banished from the galleries. Like Tate before it, MoMA will no longer bandy around terms such as cubism, post-impressionism, abstract expressionism, or conceptualism in its labels. “We were trying to imagine what we would say if we had a group of friends over to dinner who aren’t in the art world,” Lowry told me. “What would we want them to know? What would they need to know in order to have an interesting conversation?” It is certainly not, he argued, a “dumbing down”.The results of this particular innovation are, at this point, mixed – after all, you can eradicate art-world lingo and still bypass lucidity. Sometimes, refusing the actual word seems like a round in the hat game – in which participants pull a name out of a hat and describe it, without using the name itself. The introductory text of one room, titled Readymade in Paris and New York, seems, for example, to be a more or less a hat-game description of the word dada. Indeed, hanging beside it is Richard Boix’s drawing of members of the New York dada group (Man Ray, Duchamp, Katherine Dreier and others), with the word DADA writ large on it. But since the room introduction doesn’t tell you what dada is, you’d be none the wiser if you didn’t already know.All of these changes have been a long time coming. Back at the turn of the millennium, soon after Lowry was appointed, the museum experimented with a series of thematic displays called MoMA 2000. Some critics loved them some utterly rejected them. Lowry denies the museum rowed back after the mixed reception, but, rather, the displays marked the beginning of a process that has culminated in this month’s reopening, one that involved great institutional change. “It required over time a new generation of curators who came with fresh and new ideas and for whom interdisciplinarity was something natural. And we had to expand on training our vision,” he said. Over the last decade, research groups on Asian, Latin American and African art have been formed at the museum. Curators have travelled more. The great MoMA tanker has gradually turned.Unsealing the edges of modern and contemporary art in this way has, said Temkin, been “liberating, exhilarating. One thing I’ve been insisting on is changing the way people speak about gaps in the collection. It feels so wrong because it assumes there is a complete puzzle, and if we just find every single puzzle piece, one day it will be solved and complete. Right now, we are saying, ‘No, we don’t know – there is no way of knowing some complete art history.’”The museum, once a place of such authority, is now letting that authority go, admitting the impossibility of a fully coherent narrative, embracing the fact that it cannot tell the viewer everything. Strangely, its sleek and efficient spaces, so four-square, pale and elegant, renewed and enlarged at a cost of $450m (£356m), seem slightly at odds with this new intellectual porousness, despite architect Elizabeth Diller’s efforts to make it more friendly and open. It remains an intensely decorous, formal, demure museum (and it is $25 for a ticket, though the ground-floor displays, which currently include a room of paintings by Kenya-born Michael Armitage, can be visited for free). Perhaps a longing for unruliness was why I was so happy to see the holes punched out of the walls, revealing the grubby plywood sheets and dust balls lurking behind them, in a display devoted to the multidisciplinary performance artist Pope.L.The most striking example of MoMA’s new approach – as well as a relatively rare abjuration of broad chronology – is placing Picasso’s Demoiselles d’Avignon beside a visceral painting, by African American artist Faith Ringgold, documenting the 1965 Los Angeles race riots. (The 1967 work, American People Series #20: Die, was seen at Tate Modern in the 2017 exhibition Soul of a Nation.) The formal consonances between the works, made 60 years apart, are clear. MoMA’s contention is that the Picasso might illuminate the Ringgold – but also that the Ringgold might illuminate the Picasso. History, in other words, might not be working in only one direction. Which is where poetry comes in. Or, depending on your perspective and taste, the chaos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d54df609fd806505425143b2d260157c4490dfd1/0_9_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629ccf3bbb5dfe65ea8716398c7247c3","title":"david lachapelles lavazza 2020 calendar in pictures","story":"The photographer best known for his surreal celebrity portraits has teamed up with Lavazza to create their 2020 calendar.

Leaving aside the music for the moment, Elton’s public and maybe even private persona can be ided into two phases: first there was the raging drugs monster, as extravagantly talented as he was costumed. Now that he’s sober, there’s the more conservatively dressed, happily married elder statesman of British pop, a proper establishment figure, albeit one who’s still unafraid to pick fights with everyone from Keith Richards (“a monkey with arthritis”) to Madonna (“looks like a fairground stripper”). Both eras have yielded a steady crop of outstanding Elton anecdotes, often retold by Elton himself, who, possessing the kind of self-knowledge few of his fame and wealth retain, tells his stories better than anyone else. Probably the most infamous of all is the one about the time he’d been up for several days (this, clearly, was from the pre-sobriety era) when he decided something really needed to be sorted out. No, not his devastating drug addiction or his lack of sleep – the problem was the weather. So he called a chap in his office and told him to sort it out: “It’s far too windy here, can you do something about it?”Such is the wealth of material he has to choose from, this story gets only a passing mention in his outrageously enjoyable autobiography: “This is obviously the ideal moment to state once and for all that this story is a complete urban myth. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you that, because the story is completely true,” he writes, with a self-deprecating shrug. And then he moves on to the next tale, which might be about the night he and John Lennon refused to answer the door to Andy Warhol because, as Lennon hissed to Elton: “Do you want him coming in here taking photos when you’ve got icicles of coke hanging out of your nose?” Or it might be about the time Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone nearly came to blows over Princess Diana at one of his dinner parties. That he has celebrity anecdotes to burn is not a surprise. But the self-mocking tone is more unexpected from a musician so grand that at his 2014 wedding party he had one table dedicated solely to the Beatles and their families. Yet while his extraordinary talent justified his personal excesses, it is his self-awareness that has counterbalanced the narcissism and made him such a likable figure. This is, after all, the man who allowed his husband, David Furnish, to make a documentary about him and call it Tantrums and Tiaras.Elton has his own ghostwriter, of course – the “auto” in “celebrity autobiography” is always a loose concept – in the form of Alexis Petridis, this paper’s pop critic. Petridis has a journalist’s eye for the comically absurd, such as Elton’s predilection for sexual voyeurism competing with his innate tidiness (“They’d end up having sex on the snooker table with me shouting, ‘Make sure you don’t come on the baize!’ which tended to puncture the atmosphere a bit”), and he makes sure there is a laugh out loud moment on pretty much every other page. This gives a pacy originality to what could have been a by-the-numbers celebrity tale: the miserable suburban childhood, the early musical failures, the sudden meteoric success, the sex, drugs and dodgy financial advisers, the eventual redemption through marriage, parenthood and activism. The book could also have easily tipped into self-parody, with Elton as a musical Zelig figure, witnessing, in turn, the death of 1960s pop, the emergence of 70s rock, the brief burst of punk, the rise of 90s hip-hop and rap. Alongside all this is the glorious triumph of the gay rights movement in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, handily embodied by Elton himself, a pop star who once barely understood his own sexuality, but can now bring his two sons with Furnish, born by a surrogate, up on stage with him in Las Vegas, and has raised almost half a billion dollars for Aids charities. But Petridis wisely keeps the focus on the personal over the sweeping cultural: Elton’s immediate reaction to the Sex Pistols, for example, was not any cliched shock of the new, but rather delight in Johnny Rotten slagging off his friend and rival, Rod Stewart, on TV.But credit really must go to Elton, whose extremely amusing voice very much drives the book. The most acclaimed celebrity memoirs of the past two decades have been thoughtful disquisitions on the weirdness of fame itself – Rupert Everett’s autobiographies, and Feel, Chris Heath’s book about Robbie Williams. Me is not like that, and the most Elton has to say about fame is it’s a lot of fun, but probably not very good for you. His book is closer in spirit to David Niven’s memoirs with their litany of namedrops – although Niven, as far as I know, never wrote a line like “I sat around, wanking, in a dressing gown covered in my own puke.”Me is its own original thing because Elton makes fun of no one more than himself. He is utterly, astonishingly, hilariously self-lacerating. A half-hearted suicide attempt at the height of his fame could have been played for drama instead Elton merely asks: “Why was I behaving like such a twat?” He sums up the experience of writing songs for The Lion King, which ultimately won him an Oscar, as: “I was now writing a song about a warthog that farted a lot.” And yes, Elton was also mystified by the hysteria over the version of “Candle in the Wind” he wrote for Diana’s funeral.One subject he has strikingly little interest in is his creation of a catalogue of music that is now a licence to print money. He is very sweet about his friendship with his longterm lyricist, Bernie Taupin, but the process of how they write their songs is dealt with in a single paragraph, which concludes: “I can’t explain it and I don’t want to explain it.” And yet there’s no doubt his talent is miraculous. Some of his songs took as long to write as they do to listen to in one morning he knocked off “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters”, “Amy” and “Rocket Man” before breakfast.Elton has never come across as an especially warm celebrity: too sharp tongued, too ridiculous. Neither quality is played down in his memoir. And yet his clear-eyed honesty and his ear for the comic line make him a deeply appealing memoirist. By the end of the book I felt only regret that I am unlikely to get an invitation to join him on his yacht, where I could listen to him recall the time he asked Yoko Ono what happened to that herd of cattle she and John Lennon once bought: “Yoko shrugged and said, ‘Oh, I got rid of them. All that mooing.’”• Me is published by Macmillan (£25). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 020-3176 3837. Free UK p\u0026ampp over £15, online orders only.

While always the central protagonist in her dispatches from the frontline of her own life, she never pretended to be the heroine. Which makes it unsurprising that in an era with an appetite for autofiction, her mordant, vibrantly confessional autobiographical work should be experiencing a revival.Ditlevsen was a famous poet by her early 20s, but she did not consider herself young. Why would she, when a working-class childhood ended at 14? Already she had been sacked as a maid, for scrubbing a piano down with water been nanny to a boy who announced: “You must do everything I say or else I’ll shoot you” lived in a boarding house with Hitler’s portrait on the wall embarked on the first of her four doomed marriages and taken a lover who sent identical “dear Kitten” letters to all his mistresses.Ah, those men. The Copenhagen Trilogy reveals how uneasily Ditlevsen’s childhood conviction that she would one day become “a woman poet” sat with the prevailing belief – championed fervently by her domineering mother – that only marriage could protect a girl from poverty and social shame. Though Ditlevsen fulfilled her ambition to live by her pen, society’s message remained tattooed on her soul.Idly observing dogs outside the State Grain Office in Youth, she identifies wryly with “those masterless dogs that run around confusedly between people’s legs, apparently without enjoying their freedom”, and envies those with owners. “Some of them have a short leash that jerks impatiently every time they stop. Others have a long leash and their Masters wait patiently whenever an exciting smell detains the dog. That’s the kind of Master I want. That’s the kind of life I could thrive in.”Little wonder, then, that when a literary magazine accepts her first poems for publication, Ditlevsen’s imagination is fired not by the Woolfian dream of financial security and a room of one’s own, but by the eligibility of its ageing editor: “If he’s single, I have nothing against marrying him. Entirely sight unseen.”Though written years after the events they describe, the pages – fluidly translated by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman – have the immediacy of diary entries so fresh that the ink has barely dried. In reconstructing her own gaucheness, lack of education and shameless opportunism, Ditlevsen’s strength as a writer lies in her militant refusal to present her choices and their consequences – be they love affairs, backstreet abortions or chronic drug addiction – through the filters of hindsight or amour-propre.With characteristically dark wit, Ditlevsen titled the final, most powerful volume “Gift” – a word with two meanings in Danish: marriage and poison. The English title Dependency is equally apt within a few chapters, Ditlevsen, orced from the literary editor (because yes, reader, she did marry him), has escaped the pressures of a second doomed union and new motherhood and stumbled into the arms of her next husband, a quietly deranged doctor who fulfils her needs as no man has done before.To Ditlevsen the opioid Demerol, a shot of which he gives her as an alternative to foreplay, has a name that “sounds like birdsong”. Immediately, the mental and physical bliss it offers is infinitely more intense than the escapist rush she gets from writing. “I smiled thankfully at him,” she writes, “and the fluid went into my blood, lifting me up to the only level where I wanted to exist. Then he went to bed with me, like he always did, when the effect was at its peak. His embrace was strangely brief and violent.”As her dependency on Demerol and her supplier deepens, the narrative becomes utterly, agonisingly compulsive. It builds to a wrenching climax made all the more poignant by the fact that after five years of virtual captivity in the realm of addiction, Ditlevsen – finally clean, but a stranger to her own children – remains shakily aware that the gift of her third marriage lingers in her blood.And there it would stay. At the age of 58, after a series of mental breakdowns and a fourth orce, Ditlevsen put an end to her own life. Although the Copenhagen Trilogy is only a small part of her extraordinary legacy, its evocation of a working-class woman’s battle with masters, leashes and her own demons makes it a masterpiece in its own right.• Liz Jensen’s The Uninvited is published by Bloomsbury.

On the other side of the road is a field littered with assorted machinery.“There used to be an oil depot there, but now it’s closed,” she says. “They say it’s going to become a museum and a park.” The mother of four circles back towards the empty plot behind the station: “And this one is Dubai now.”For decades La Gare, Addis Ababa’s 101-year-old central railway station, had slumbered, gathering cobwebs in the shadow of the many high-rises that have sprung up in the Ethiopian capital in recent years. But lately it has been transformed.Today, above the Romanesque arches, the name of an Abu Dhabi-based property firm, Eagle Hills, glitters in gold. Company flags flutter along the road leading to the police-patrolled entrance. The iconic station hotel, Buffet de la Gare, which was bulldozed last month, is a heap of rubble next door. Woinshet’s home is also being demolished.Under Ethiopia’s charismatic prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who was recently awarded the Nobel peace prize after forging a peace deal with Eritrea shortly after his appointment in April last year, and his lieutenant in the capital, deputy mayor Takele Uma, Addis Ababa is undergoing its most radical facelift in a generation, with the old station as the centrepiece.The station will anchor a vast development project, also called La Gare, in the heart of the city comprising malls, offices, five-star hotels, more than 4,000 luxury apartments and a surrounding park, as well as, in theory, low-cost housing for the district’s current residents.Covering 36 hectares (89 acres), and with a price tag of $1.8bn (£1.4bn), Eagle Hills’ project was the largest and most expensive of its kind in the country’s history when it was announced last year. It is now already about to be surpassed: according to Takele, a Chinese company is investing $3bn in a 37-hectare, upmarket complex in Addis Ababa’s Gotera district. And more projects are coming, he claims, citing potential interest from European, American and Turkish investors.Earlier this year, Abiy hinted at recasting the capital’s skyline – currently a hodgepodge of drab Soviet-style tower blocks and cheap Chinese new-builds – as something closer to the gleaming megalopolises of the Gulf.“If you can change Addis, definitely you can change Ethiopia,” he told the Financial Times, adding that on his very first day as prime minister he had ordered a shiny, modernist makeover of his own office.For years Addis Ababa has resembled a building site – creaking under concrete skeletons and belching Isuzu lorries – but now, according to the mayor, the watchwords are “greenery” and “renovation”.“After we took office we said, look, instead of building new buildings, instead of starting new construction, let’s start by renovating and maintaining the existing city infrastructure,” says Takele, who says 448 public schools and 13 public hospitals are being refurbished.But there is much more to this wave of construction than that. Last week the palace of Emperor Menelik II, who founded the city in the late 19th century, was opened to the public as a museum, park and, soon, zoo – a pet project that the prime minister outlined in a 40-minute documentary broadcast on state television last month. Around the corner will be a new $58m national library, which Takele says will have a 3,500-seat capacity.And in February, the prime minister’s office unveiled futuristic plans to turn 31 hectares of filthy, litter-strewn river banks into public parks, bicycle paths and waterside terraces complete with outdoor cafes and restaurants. Though a more modest rehabilitation scheme had been in the pipeline for several years, this turbocharged version, known as Beautifying Sheger after the city’s nickname, was billed as Abiy’s personal initiative. It is projected to cost $1bn over three years, and work on the first 12km by a Chinese firm has already begun.Across the road from city hall – which is also undergoing a $54m renovation – ground has been broken for the Adwa centre: a $156m public entertainment complex designed to celebrate Ethiopia’s 1896 defeat of the Italians. Adwa, which will include a museum, library, meeting hall and cinema, is being built on some of the 600 hectares of disused land authorities have reclaimed from investors since 2018.One enormous plot of this kind, situated near the Sheraton hotel – and which, like the Adwa land, belonged to Saudi-Ethiopian businessman Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi – is being turned into a public park. Another park, with mountain trails and horse-riding, is planned for nearby Mount Entoto, and will cost $51m.The figures are eye-watering, and have provoked criticism in some quarters. “The scale of the projects is a bit scary when you consider the scale of the urban problems we have,” says the architect Bisrat Kifle.“Of course it’s important to clean our rivers – but the problem is priorities,” agrees Ezana Haddis, an urban planner at the University of Manchester. “We need to do it incrementally, and not on this scale.”In the case of Beautifying Sheger, China pledged to foot a quarter of the bill. Some of the rest will be paid for by Abiy’s “Dine for Sheger” campaign, a lavish fundraising dinner held in May at Menelik Palace for which guests paid $175,000 each to attend.As for other projects, Takele says the costs will be covered by the city budget, and points out that his administration is also working on a Rapid Bus Transit system as well as ambitious plans to overhaul the capital’s water supply by building two dams outside the city, to be funded by the World Bank and China’s Exim Bank. The private sector will be harnessed to build a new overpass system, helping ease traffic, and also to deliver low-cost housing on 1,000 hectares of land in the inner city, he says.He also claims that, unlike under his predecessors, nobody will be left homeless or even relocated to social housing on the edge of the city. “Now the plan is to build housing in the centre of the city, so they have access to everything.” He says the first phase of development at La Gare will be new homes for those, like Woinshet, whose old neighbourhood is being demolished.The government has also taken a minority share in both La Gare and the Gotera project, which Takele says means revenue for the administration long into the future. “It’s a new model of development,” he says.Abiy, for his part, has argued that Beautifying Sheger is “not development, it is an investment”, and said it will lead to an increase in the value of urban land from which the state, as ultimate owner of all land in Ethiopia, will benefit.Not everyone is convinced. Ezana argues that “these kind of projects are high-end projects” that will aggravate social segregation, despite the government’s promises to rehouse everyone on site.“Very few people in Addis could afford to live in these flats. So developers or someone else will buy them out,” he says. “They’ll be displaced by market forces.”Meanwhile, Slieshi Degefa of the River Basins \u0026amp Green Areas Agency has said that up to 10,000 residents could be relocated as part of efforts to clean the rivers and surrounding areas. Several residents complained that they had been told their homes would be demolished and they were uncertain about their future.“We are not happy at all,” says Mekbib, whose neighbourhood of 450 houses near the palace is to be cleared for a park. “They didn’t consult us. Two months ago they just arrived with a form to be filled in within two days. It was a total shock.”And then there are those who feel that, even if the government’s intentions are positive, the lack of consultation with professionals is worrying. Biruk Terrefe, aPhD candidate at Oxford University’s Department of International Development, argues that “the roll-out of big infrastructure that essentially still ignores existing plans ... and blindsides city administration officials sets a dangerous precedent”. In this sense, he says, the administration is acting much like past Ethiopian regimes – despite the new rhetoric.La Gare, for instance, came out of nowhere, catching almost all architects, policymakers and city planners by surprise. The deal seems to have been struck at the highest diplomatic level, between Abiy and the Emirati rulers, as part of a package of investment geared towards easing Ethiopia’s hard currency shortage. Even the city’s planning office was kept in the dark.The architect Nahom Tekle describes it as a “blank slate intervention” that ignores the city’s existing urban fabric. The old station sits at the southern end of Addis Ababa’s only historic avenue, with a view all the way to city hall on a hilltop in the distance. La Gare will obstruct this entirely.“How dare someone block this historic vista and view?” Nahom asks. “This is the only landmark urban space the city has.”Takele’s confidence, however, is undimmed. For him and the prime minister, it seems, gentrifying Addis Ababa is an endeavour that, like previous state megaprojects, Ethiopians should rally behind as a symbol of national pride.“The name Addis Ababa means ‘new flower’, and we need to make it live up to the name,” he says. “I’m sure one day this will be one of the best cities in Africa, and in the world – but we need to start now.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fca3e448fb2fc60feec5a1a2327be76aa28f099/0_0_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a62db3f8f81db8843bdb1b23aea289e2","title":"congratulations esther duflo female economists","story":"The long history of bias, discrimination and underestimation of women in the field of economics is why Esther Duflo’s prize is a such a great step forwardThis week, MIT’s Esther Duflo became the second female economist to win a Nobel prize. She and her husband, Abhijit Banerjee, also of MIT, and Michael Kremer of Harvard University, shared the award “for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”.In Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way To Fight Global Poverty, Duflo and Banerjee studied the poor not as “cartoon characters” but as human beings “in all their complexity and richness”. In 2003, they founded the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT to study poverty.A coincidence, perhaps, but it’s telling that Duflo collaborates with her husband. For decades, it has been common for female economists to marry fellow economists. The profession has been notorious for its lack of gender parity. It’s the reason we need more female economists like Duflo.A 2018 American Economic Association (AEA) survey found that nearly 100 female economists said that a peer or colleague had sexually assaulted them and nearly 200 claimed they were the victims of attempted assault. Nearly half of the women surveyed said they had avoided speaking at a conference or seminar because of possible harassment or “disrespectful treatment”. Seven in 10 women said they felt their colleagues’ work was taken more seriously than their own.The survey was part of a reckoning in economics on the topic of women. The University of California, Berkeley, undergraduate Alice Wu’s 2017 paper on gender bias in the economics job market reported that women are held to higher standards and get less credit for co-authored work. Wu scoured more than a million anonymous posts in online message boards where economists gossiped about hiring. She found that the words most associated with discussions of women included “hotter”, “hot” and “gorgeous”. Wu’s work led the AEA to address the status of women in the profession, including through the survey and a new code of professional conduct.Economists have long held biased views of women. In 1973, a year after Duflo was born, the US Congress Joint Economic Committee held hearings on the economic role of women following a Council of Economic Advisors report. Marina Whitman, then a CEA staff member and University of Pittsburgh economics professor – who would become a chief economist at General Motors – testified that “the economics profession has been slow in developing expertise on the special problems of women”.The topic of discussion was a passage in the MIT professor Paul Samuelson’s textbook Economics, published in 1948, about rationing. “Of course, there are always a few women and soapbox orators, who are longer on intuition than brains and who blame their troubles on the mechanism of rationing itself rather than on the shortage,” wrote Samuelson.The MIT economist had created a firestorm over remarks in the New York Times that female students at a Virginia women’s college wouldn’t be able to handle extra credit questions in the new edition of his textbook.Samuelson received letters. Patricia Eames, general counsel of the Textile Workers Union, asked why he had to “go around making male chauvinist statements”. The Columbia University professor Ann Harris wrote: “Your remark implies a sexual bias and helps to perpetrate the idea that women are no good at mathematics and economics and not much interested in such things anyway. I happen to know several women at Columbia who are economists or are studying to be economists. They find a great deal of male bias and prejudice faces them.” A public apology was offered. In Newsweek, he admitted he made “some derogatory remarks” and apologized to the college and “to the feminine sex in general”.Samuelson was part of a grand economics tradition of marginalizing women. Economics textbooks included biased representations of fictional characters and under-represented female business leaders, entrepreneurs and policymakers. That tradition is still strong, but we are making strides in seeing women represented more fairly in the field.This long history of bias, discrimination and underestimation of women in economics is why Esther Duflo’s prize is a such a great step forward. One can only hope that many more female economists will follow in her footsteps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/596b82f67ee5aa59b633dd54dbbfc85f2b1d4aa0/49_165_3392_2035/master/3392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a946c93c752d8aeafc21f257e52477e3","title":"impostor syndrome class unfairness","story":"Let’s stop using this shifty term. It just encourages people to blame themselves for deep structural unfairnessThe term “impostor syndrome” has enjoyed a lot of airtime in recent years, yet it’s always troubled me. One person who I’m sure has never suffered from it is Boris Johnson. Between fortifying racists and humiliating our country on a daily basis, I’ll admit that there aren’t many positives to be taken from his shambolic premiership. But one thing it has done is finally shatter any illusion that many of today’s politicians – and by extension business leaders, media executives and even lawyers – are there on merit. I’ve got a radical idea that instead of focusing on the symptoms of poor mental health, as we so often do, we should begin to look at some of the causes, starting with the assumption that those in power got there entirely under their own steam, and that millions still struggle to make ends meet because of their own personal failings.Watching a leader such as Johnson bumble his way from one disaster to the next should make us all deeply sceptical about this idea of social mobility. Not only does the concept necessarily create losers, but it also neglects to mention the elusive, middle-class “club” mentality that underscores so many success stories. Decoding the language, styles and tastes of the upper classes creates a huge amount of uncredited and unremunerated labour even for those who do climb the ladder and manage to work the system to their advantage. And once they do achieve success, the sense that they are impostors, and that their success is somehow undeserved, seldom goes away.The seemingly medical nature of the term “impostor syndrome” is also problematic, suggesting a psychological shortcoming on the part of those who suffer from it. But far from being the product of a pathology, what seems more likely is that impostor syndrome is a rather natural reaction of anyone from a working-class, disadvantaged or minority background to the various biases they face on a daily basis.What far-reaching and harmful message are we sending out when we paint the natural reaction of working-class and marginalised people as evidence of some kind of “syndrome”? Some will say it’s only a word, not a medical diagnosis, but it represents an attempt to inidualise a structural issue, and to place the burden of responsibility at the door of the undervalued, or excluded. This only adds to the list of things that working-class and marginalised people already have to contend with in the continuing struggle to achieve any kind of self-esteem.When we think about “impostor syndrome”, there are several underlying biases we should address: the unquestioned deference towards the displays of confidence taught by private schooling, not to mention the painting of confidence-verging-on-egoism as “normal” and “sane”, while everyone else is painted as deficient. But every month I see fresh takes in the media on how to overcome the feeling of being an impostor, by ironing out tendencies that erge from the prescribed, middle-class standards of professionalism, and embodying that same “confidence” taught by private schooling.It takes a huge amount of confidence to care for the elderly, to conduct yourself in front of a room full of screaming children, or to drive a bus on the streets of London. Yet the pervasive definition of confidence – the one that we’re told to perfect, if we want a white-collar job – precludes these notions. It’s about oratory, debating style and being able to push through your agenda at the expense of any kind of careful thinking, or discussion. How many instances of sociopathy have we collectively permitted as a result of this way of thinking?In a society that is drunk on market logic, that sense of impostordom may just be the guiding light you need to see things clearly. However, while it may go against the ideas peddled by most self-help and management books, I would suggest we don’t internalise the structural shame imposed by the corporate workplace, as well as by certain seats of learning and certain social circles. It’s important for all of us to remain vigilant to the many ways in which it dehumanises us and strips us of our identity.With class very much back on the public agenda, it’s time to consider some of the quieter but no less harmful permutations of a deeply classist society – starting with the idea that the issue is in our minds, and not a deeply entrenched system of bias and discrimination. That’s where the problem really lies.• Nathalie Olah is the author of Steal As Much As You Can"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dd24af614a8d67ae37a9739b03d0b3af29bc399/0_0_5791_3475/master/5791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705591045d8a4f9769814b416beb4346","title":"ontarios wild beauty and rugged adventure is all in the outdoors","story":"With vast and beautiful wilderness areas, and a staggering quarter of a million lakes, Ontario is the perfect place to experience outdoor relaxation and adventure“It is wonderful to feel the grandness of Canada in the raw,” wrote Emily Carr, an icon of 20th-century Canadian art, whose vibrant landscape works charted the colours and shapes of the country more evocatively than any before – or since.To speak of this grandness in the raw is to speak of Ontario, the country’s most populous province. Long before the 14 million who now call Ontario home got here, the place was shaped forever by glacial erosion that gouged and quarried so much of the land that falls within the province’s boundaries.The result left Ontario with upwards of 250,000 lakes, and while the province boasts Canada’s largest city in Toronto and its capital city in Ottawa, it is away from the urban centres that it truly offers itself as a paradise for nature lovers.Ontario is a place for all comers and all seasons. Adventure arrives adrenaline soaked or at a much slower pace … with plenty of options in between. And the best of those options usually come on, or at least very near, a body of water.In the rustic cabins and cottages that hug every one of those quarter of a million lakes, kitschy slogan wall hangings are ubiquitous, but the advice they offer is nothing if not accurate: “Life is better at the lake.”Head downstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and US border. Cruise the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence to take in stunning seasonal views. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originates from these parts.But of course there’s a lot more to do in 1,000 Islands than just cruise around. There is a plethora of outdoor activities of varying levels of intensity, available for everyone to partake in. Alongside the obligatory boating, swimming and paddling, try cycling the 1,000 Islands Parkway Trail in summer – a glorious, winding 24-mile stretch skirting the coves and bays between Gananoque and Brockville. Meanwhile, the cooler months bring with them a whole array of new activities, from hiking the Marble Rock conservation area to high-octane snowmobile runs through the island backcountry.Less than two-and-a-half hours east from the hustle of Toronto, Prince Edward County is an idyllic escape on Lake Ontario. Technically an island, it juts out into the eastern corner of the lake near the head of the St Lawrence River. A permanent home for almost 25,000 people, the county opens its arms to visitors who come for its mix of natural beauty, endless action options and one of the most happening artisanal food and drink scenes in Canada.Sandbanks provincial park is the undoubted star of the county, a sprawling natural expanse that connects three beaches and ranks as the world’s largest freshwater sand bar and dune system. Hiking trails crisscross the park and the pristine waters are perfect for a dip in summer. But don’t be afraid to take things up a notch nearby (especially when the breeze picks up) with some kiteboarding and sailing lessons under the expert tutelage of the AirTime Kiteboarding team. Canoe and kayak rental options abound too.No matter what you’ve been getting up to, it’s not difficult to work up an appetite in the county. The best way to do so might well be by first quenching your thirst on two wheels. Cycle-and-sip tours of the island’s up-and-coming wineries are outrageously good fun. But don’t miss out on the brewery scene either (the area is renowned for its ciders), with Midtown and Parsons being the pick of the bunch.Picton, the island’s main hub is full of excellent dining and drinking options such as Hartley’s Tavern and 555 Brewing Co, but perhaps the biggest name around is the Drake Devonshire, located in the nearby waterfront town of Wellington. Billing itself as the ultra-hip country sister to its iconic downtown Toronto original, the Drake Devonshire delivers just as consistently as its urban sibling when it comes to the kitchen. Splurge and stay overnight at one of its unique rooms where every artsy detail is obsessed over. The Drake team also recently opened a more cost-conscious – but still cool – option next door with their Motor Inn.Meanwhile, the nearby Muskoka region – or as Ontarians call it, “cottage country” – is both a relaxation and outdoor adventure hub.The region is, like so many others in Ontario, famous for its lakes – and there’s no shortage of action to be had out on the water or hugging the shoreline. There are plenty of great options for canoeing, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as angling and boating trips and tours aplenty. But for a truly wild thrill, try flyboarding, the newest adrenaline rush available on water. Think of a flyboard as a water-powered jetpack for your feet. It sucks the water from the wake of a boat or jetski through an 18-metre hose and propels you high up over the lake. If it sounds unbelievable, just try it for yourself in Muskoka.Back on dry land, step up your adventure settings with a visit to Muskoka Zip Lines and Aerial Park. Clamber over rope bridges and obstacles in the treetop aerial adventure course, or take the zip line canopy tour crisscrossing the park for a fast and fun high-altitude thrill over seven connected zip lines. For those inclined to keep their feet a bit closer to solid ground, take a horseback trail ride with Winding Fences Farm across the beautiful open terrain in the pastures surrounding the town of Windermere.Those looking for an all-frills, all-inclusive experience will find it at the JW Marriott The Rosseau Muskoka. Not only is this luxury resort and spa considered one of Canada’s finest, but its outdoor adventure options include stand-up paddleboarding, canoeing and kayaking from its exclusive lakeside beach, as well as a spectacular new 180-metre zipline that runs across the Five Bridges Trail on the resort’s grounds.Ontario’s adrenaline hotspot – the Blue Mountain resort, which not only boasts the province’s best winter sports but an amazing variety of activities the other nine months of the year – sits on the shores of another of the Great Lakes, Lake Huron. In the summer months, just 10 minutes from the resort is a private beach on the shores of Georgian Bay, where visitors can surf, and rent boats, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards, alongside other fun, family friendly activities on shore, from the Timber Challenge High Ropes Course to the Ridge Runner Mountain Coaster. Of course, when you’re ready to take things down a gear or two, the resort’s pedestrian-friendly village has a fantastic offering of restaurants, bars and pubs, as well as a great entertainment programme featuring live music and other events such as Movies Under the Stars.There’s also the perfect excuse to seriously chill at the Scandinave Spa Blue Mountain. Located in a tranquil forest, the spa has a strict “no electronic devices” policy to ensure maximum unwind time. But when you’re basking in thermal and Nordic waterfalls, hot baths and Finnish and infrared saunas, why would you want to be thinking about the outside world anyway?While no trip to Ontario could be considered complete without at least one trek through Algonquin provincial park in search of that blessed moose, or (from a distance) bear sighting, during the summer months fun on the water takes centre stage. Algonquin is home to dozens of lakes and small tributaries, and while some of them are only accessible through the backcountry, Algonquin Outfitters offers a number of excursions, from wildlife spotting day trips to canoeing. You could also try Parkbus, a fantastic and sustainable transport service that ensures city dwellers and tourists can fully connect with nature. Stops in Algonquin include paddlers’ paradise, Lake Opeongo and the serene Pog Lake.Of course it’s not just about the resort towns and big name outdoor destinations, there are plenty of adventures to be had throughout cottage country – with ample options to hike, get out on the water or just generally unwind. From Haliburton to Huntsville and south to Gravenhurst, there are local gems with water access for lazy morning kayaking and nearby trails for afternoon hikes. And for those who really want to get away from it all, Cabinscape offers tiny custom-made, ecologically friendly cabins perched in the wilderness of southern Ontario – and some of the options are so off-grid that they’re hike-in access only.But much like the wider province itself, it’s the far-off corners that reveal Ontario’s true character – a little rugged, a little wild, altogether unforgettable.Start planning your visit to Ontario this winter with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77a3e80682d475f792c650d6effaa0abd91318b/0_14_5477_3288/master/5477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f96a2f02190ba8c7daca455ac0ddf6b1","title":"how to be a sustainable student","story":"From cutting out beef to repairing old clothes, here are some tips for freshers who want to be green at universityAs university doors opened in September for a new year, an estimated 6 million people across the world took to the streets in a historic week of climate action.The power of this youth-led uprising reflected the urgency for action on the environment. So what now? For freshers starting a new chapter at university, deciding how to live your life is vital. Here are some ideas for how you can be sustainable as a student.What you put on your plate matters: nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gases come from agriculture, and most of those are from meat and dairy. Cutting out meat (if you’re able to) is an easy way to reduce your carbon footprint, and you’ll save money too.A meat-free diet has been recommended as the “single-biggest way” an inidual can reduce their impact on the planet. Meat and dairy consumption result in excessive land use, industrial emissions, methane, water use and deforestation.Universities are now reacting to this: Goldsmiths has scrapped the sale of all beef products from its campus as it seeks to become carbon neutral by 2025. “The growing global call for organisations to take seriously their responsibilities for halting climate change is impossible to ignore,” the university’s warden, Frances Corner, said.This year scientists devised a planetary health diet, presenting a way to address the environmental (and health) impact of our food choices. It recommends the global average consumption of red meat should be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts should double.Whatever you choose to eat, try to shop locally and seasonally. You’ll most likely avoid the plastic packaging you find in supermarkets, and these products will have a lower carbon footprint. If you have the space – even just a windowsill will do – try growing some of your own herbs or vegetables it’s amazing what you can get from just a window box planter. You can also reduce food waste by planning meals in advance, eating leftovers and sharing meals with friends.Forget fast fashion: keeping your clothes for as long as possible has much more than just monetary value. In the UK, clothing has the fourth-largest environmental impact after housing, transport and food. We throw away more than half of our fast-fashion items within less than a year.So recycle your clothes, mend them, or accessorise them. If you don’t have those skills see if there’s a sewing society you could join, or head to a repair cafe where people mend clothes for free. Try clothes swaps with friends, and instead of buying new items head to a charity or second-hand shop.If you want to buy new clothes, says Ynes Patat, a fashion student at the University of Northampton, “look at brands that appeal to your style but research to see if they do have sustainable qualities, like Patagonia or Pact (they prize themselves on being organic, GOTS-certified, fair trade and eco-friendly). Even some high street stores are turning to more sustainable fashion.”For some freshers, this will be your first time living alone, which means doing your own decorating, washing, cooking and cleaning. There are simple ways you can change your habits to live more sustainably. Wash your clothes at a lower temperature, and opt for a bamboo toothbrush or more eco-friendly sanitary products. Invest in a clothes horse so you stop using a tumble drier (you’ll be surprised how much your energy bill goes down). When shopping, see if there’s a zero-waste shop nearby – Sheffield students’ union has opened a store selling dried food, household products, toiletries and kitchenware all free from plastic packaging. Just turn up with your own container.Of course, the easiest way to make a difference is to cut out flying. A return trip from Manchester to Berlin produces about 214 kg of CO2 there are 15 countries where the average person produces less CO2 in a year. If you’re planning a weekend away with new friends, try and travel by train or bus instead.

Its owners, the Green family, are prominent Christian evangelicals and, under the guidance of the Hobby Lobby president, Steve Green, were behind the founding of Washington’s $400m Museum of the Bible in 2017.A statement published by the Egypt Exploration Society, which manages the Papyri project, claimed it was told by the Museum of the Bible that 11 fragments were sold to it by Obbink in two batches in 2010.The society and the university confirmed Obbink was under investigation. He continues to be employed at Oxford.  has contacted him for comment.The lecturer in papyrology and Greek literature has previously denied some of the allegations, telling the Daily Beast in 2018 that the claim he sold a fragment of the first chapter of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby was not true.In its statement, the Egypt Exploration Society, which owns the collection and conducted the investigation, said the issue had contributed to Obbink’s removal as general editor of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri project “because of unsatisfactory discharge of his editorial duties, but also because of concerns, which he did not allay, about his alleged involvement in the marketing of ancient texts”.The statement said file records relating to the missing fragments had also been removed. “These texts were taken without authorisation from the EES, and in most of the 13 cases the catalogue card and photograph are also missing.”The statement follows intensive investigations after reports in the Daily Beast this year speculated about the possibility that Obbink had sold a highly prized fragment – if it is real – of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby and the Green family.Commenting after the statement on Monday, Nongbri said: “The sale of the manuscripts and the attempt to cover it up by removing records is almost unbelievable. But the first thing to note are the words ‘so far’. We don’t yet know the full extent of this. More items may well have been sold to Hobby Lobby.”The Green family and Steve Green have been embroiled in multiple scandals over the long-running programme of purchasing biblical fragments for the Museum of the Bible. According to the Egypt Exploration Society, its investigations have revealed that 13 pieces in the museum’s collection are in fact the rightful property of the nonprofit society.In a statement, the Museum of the Bible said the antiquities were “sold illegally” by a “known expert”, adding that of the 13 items identified, only four were the property of the museum, with the remainder belonging to Hobby Lobby as part of the Green collection.The Green family has assembled what it describes as one of the largest collections of biblical antiquities in the world, many of which are on display in the Museum of the Bible.However, the Greens and the museum have been dogged by controversy over the provenance of some of its acquisitions. In June 2017, Hobby Lobby Stores was ordered to pay a $3m fine for illegally importing thousands of ancient Iraqi artefacts that were falsely labelled and shipped to the company through the United Arab Emirates and Israel.Commenting after that case Hobby Lobby said it “did not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process” and relied on dealers who did not understand how to properly ship the items.In a second high-profile controversy, the Green family and the Museum of the Bible were forced to remove five document fragments – described as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls – when they were identified as modern forgeries after reporting by the  and other media organisations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c9ec2c34980c96c8623ed134261c23dfcdd12a6/0_25_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84e5a067e9c6dfd74d8ae5baf02f6eeb","title":"little progress made in tackling air pollution in europe research says","story":"European Environment Agency found levels of fine particulate matter stalled after decades of reductionsLittle progress has been made on tackling air quality in Europe, new research shows, despite public outcry in many countries and increasing awareness of the health impacts of pollution.Levels of the dangerous fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, which can lodge deep in the lungs and pass into the bloodstream, appear to have reached a plateau across Europe, after more than a decade of gradual reductions. The results come from the European Environment Agency’s Air Quality in Europe 2019 report, published on Wednesday, which collates data taken from thousands of monitoring stations in 2017.In 2016, the latest year for which an accurate count can be made, there were about 412,000 premature deaths in Europe from PM2.5 alone, according to the EEA. From 2014 to 2017, the levels of fine particulate matter remained broadly flat, after long-term reductions in levels of the pollutant stretching back to 2000.The government has pledged to bring forward air quality commitments in new legislation announced in the Queen’s speech on Monday. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said more recent data than that included in the EEA report showed “positive progress”, including one fewer road zone showing breaches in safe levels of NO2 in 2018 compared with 2017.“We are working hard to reduce transport emissions and are already investing £3.5bn to clean up our air, while our Clean Air Strategy has been praised by the WHO as an ‘example for the rest of the world to follow’,” the spokesperson said. “Our environment bill will drive further improvements, increasing local powers to address key sources of air pollution and introducing a duty to set a legally-binding target to reduce fine particulate matter.”Campaigners urged ministers to include legally binding targets based on WHO standards, with a duty on public bodies to take action to meet the targets, and a right to clean air enshrined in law.Greg Archer, UK director at the NGO Transport \u0026amp Environment, said the bill must be strengthened: “The proposed environment bill will create an undernourished, toothless watchdog. Without ambitious targets and actions to tackle air pollution, people will continue to die unnecessarily.”Bates added: “Ministers must also scrap their multi-billion pound road-building programme, and invest in cleaner alternatives such as better public transport, cycling and walking facilities. This will not only allow people to breath more easily, it will also help address the climate emergency.”Levels of ammonia are also on the rise, driven by farming. Ammonia can combine with other pollutants in the air to harm human health, and is also damaging to plants and wildlife.  revealed earlier this year that 3,000 deaths a year could be avoided in the UK by halving ammonia emissions from farms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be196b54a2962e1a8382a662080fe76138855ce/179_0_5022_3015/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0928611701de36fb9e2c2245fa6030f","title":"wildlife photographer of the year 2019 winners in pictures","story":"Hailing from the Chinese province of Qinghai, Yongqing Bao has won the prestigious wildlife photographer of the year 2019 title for his image The Moment, which frames the standoff between a Tibetan fox and a marmot.

The unseeded Arsenal, who are England’s other team in the tournament and who could have faced the holders Lyon, were handed the kinder tie against Slavia Prague.It has been a tough year for Duggan, who joined Barcelona alongside the star of the Netherlands’ Euro 2017 campaign Lieke Martens to help usher in a new era of investment in Catalonia. She left Barça this summer after a season which the club ended empty handed, having lost a Copa de la Reina semi-final against Atlético and finished six points behind Atléti in the league.A somewhat surprising Champions League run, helped by a kind draw, to a first final was tempered by a bruising 4-1 defeat to Lyon. While Duggan was hardworking but fairly anonymous at one end of the pitch, a 16-minute hat-trick from Ada Hegerberg up the other end, after Dszenifer Marozsán’s early opener, stole the show and crushed Barça.Duggan was distraught that night. Tearstained and struggling to stay composed, she said: “It’s disappointing. As a footballer I want to come here and win, I don’t want to just be here for the occasion. I’m really sad, that’s understandable right now but I’m sure I’ll look back on it in the future and realise we created history.”Looking to put the defeat behind her she left for France with England, but her World Cup campaign was hampered from the off when she picked up a thigh strain in the first training session in the French Riviera. The forward supposedly shook off that knock but did not look her usual self when out on the left wing, with the toll of a long season also undoubtedly playing its part.But a new season brings a new journey. Duggan, having scored in Barcelona’s 2-0 defeat of Atléti in front of a league record 60,739 fans last campaign, switched to the league winners this summer.A rollercoaster start to the season, however, has showed that this is not the same Atlético Madrid side that outclassed Manchester City in the round of 32 last season. In their second league game of the season, for example, they suffered a humiliating and shocking 6-1 defeat to Barcelona.A 90th-minute goal from Virginia Torrecilla ensured a 3-2 victory in Serbia against Spartak Subotica in the Champions League round of 32 first leg before a tense second game ended 1-1 to set up the meeting with City.The team are third in the league, only a point behind Barça and second-placed Deportivo de la Coruña, and it is not quite time to panic in Madrid, but with the manager José Luis Sánchez Vera departing – for personal, rather than performance-related, reasons according to the club – Atléti are going through a difficult period. The fairly unknown Pablo López, who has managed men’s teams in Segunda B and the third and fourth isions, has stepped in until the end of the season.The trip to the north west of England will be his second game in charge, having started with a 1-0 win at Levante on Saturday. The game on Wednesday could not have offered a bigger test of his nascent tenure.City are flying in all competitions. Nick Cushing’s team are unbeaten and have only conceded once in seven games. Revenge for last season’s frustrating Champions League exit, beaten 2-0 at home after drawing 1-1 in Madrid, will be on their minds too. In Duggan, though, Atlético perhaps have the key to unlocking City if they can take advantage of her knowledge of the opposition manager and pick her brains on how to handle the 11 City players that she has played with internationally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b793ac86b8563ea512c9975d0b36a65ee4ac88ec/0_10_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c79392fe26307caa75385f9db7371fdf","title":"expel teams from tournaments over racism urges kick it out chief bulgaria england","story":"Boris Johnson has joined demands by anti-racism campaigners for Uefa to take strong action after the racist chanting that marred England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria on Monday night.European football’s governing body has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) for racist behaviour of its supporters after the incidents at the Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia, in which some home fans made monkey noises at Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford in the 6-0 victory for Gareth Southgate’s side.The BFU was also charged over Nazi salutes by fans and the throwing of objects from the stands, while they and the English Football Association (FA) were both charged over the disruption of national anthems. The FA also faces a separate charge of having insufficient travelling stewards.The match was halted twice during the first half under Uefa’s anti-racism protocols after Mings and Southgate alerted officials about the abuse, with television pictures at half-time also showing several fans using Nazi salutes. Their actions were condemned by the anti-­discrimination groups Kick It Out and Fare, while the FA chairman, Greg Clarke – who is also vice-president of Uefa – called for the authorities to now show “zero tolerance”. The sports minister, Nigel Adams, has ­written to the Uefa president, Aleksander Čeferin, offering support and asking him to take “urgent action” after the prime minister’s spokesman said the incidents were a “stain on football”.“The England players and management showed tremendous dignity and the prime minister commends the players who were targeted for this ­despicable abuse for their response,” he added. “We support the FA’s calls for an urgent investigation with tough penalties to follow.”A section of the stadium was closed for Monday’s game after Uefa imposed sanctions over racist incidents during Bulgaria’s qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June.The punishment will also apply in the home game against the Czech Republic next month. The next step would be to implement a full stadium closure, as was the case with Montenegro after England’s players endured similar racial abuse during the qualifier in Podgorica in March, although Uefa’s disciplinary panel is allowed to go much further and has the power to expel a country from a tournament.However, Bulgaria is expected to argue that those responsible for the problems were in the minority and dealt with by stadium stewards.A group of about 50 people, who are understood to have been members of club side Lokomotiv Plov’s “ultras” group Lauta Army, were asked to leave at half-time. Čeferin has defended Uefa’s punishments for racism as “among the toughest in sport” and called on for a “war” on ­discrimination but added that it would require the help of governments and the whole “football family” to tackle the problem.“Believe me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football,” he said. “We cannot afford to be content with this. We must always strive to strengthen our resolve.“More broadly, the football family– everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans – needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to ­marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.” He added: “Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments to0 need to do more.”But Kick It Out demanded that Uefa should consider a points ­deduction or tournament expulsion. “The fines from Uefa we don’t think are enough,” chief executive, Roisin Wood, said on the Today programme. “There have to be serious steps now, and that should include looking at expulsion or not letting people enter ­tournaments, because there has to be a clear message. This is 2019. These are ­professional players going out to play. You would never expect to get this in your workplace so why should ­professional players get it in theirs?”Gianni Infantino, president of Fifa, the world game’s governing body, said he wanted “all football governing ­bodies to join us and think together of new, stronger and more effective ways to eradicate racism in football”.He added: “As a starting point, I ­suggest that all competition organisers enact regulations which envisage life bans from stadiums for those who are found guilty of racist behaviour at a football match. Fifa can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.”Borislav Mihaylov, the BFU’s president, has resigned after the prime minister, Boyko Borissov, demanded that he stepped down following his comments before the match last week. The former Reading goalkeeper had urged Uefa to take action against ­England after the Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, said ­Southgate’s side would walk off the pitch if they heard racist chanting.That reaction was applauded by the Manchester City and England forward Sterling, who was also on the receiving end of racist abuse in Montenegro. “A good move credits to you M. Borissov,” Sterling wrote on Twitter. But the Bulgaria goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, saw it differently after the match, claiming the home supporters had “behaved well” and that England’s players had “overreacted a bit”.Yet the Aston Villa defender Mings, who was making his first international appearance on Monday, admitted he had spoken out because he felt a duty to report the abuse.“It didn’t affect my feelings,” he said. “I think I’m quite lucky in that way because I don’t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don’t have a voice. It was important that it was bigger than me, bigger than what I felt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41fecb00f68d5ca42905d5c28cd439856551e99c/0_58_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d725b7e22c2a758a0b5a2a63358bbdd7","title":"exeter city league two jack sparkes","story":"For Exeter full-back Jack Sparkes there is no shortage of inspiration around City’s training groundThirteen games in, only an inferior goals-for column keeps Exeter City off the League Two summit. Having finished ninth in May, two places and one point below the hallowed dotted line following successive play-off final defeats at Wembley, they are well versed in fine margins. Like last season, they have made a barnstorming start – Exeter have lost one league game and are a point shy of where they were 12 months ago – but the aim is to go one step further under Matt Taylor this time around.Depending on which way you look at it, they have either an experienced group sprinkled with homegrown talent or a youthful squad complemented by a series of senior professionals, including Aaron Martin, Lee Martin and Nicky Law, once of Southampton, Manchester United and Rangers respectively. Then there is Dean Moxey, whose career has come full circle having returned to his boyhood club two years ago, a player the highly-rated left wing-back Jack Sparkes grew up watching on the terraces with his dad. “As a little kid, you think: ‘This is where I want to be,’” says Sparkes, 19, who hails from Exmouth and spent last season on loan at Chippenham Town and Salisbury.For Sparkes, there is no shortage of inspiration. The exterior of the academy offices at the training ground are graffitied with cutouts of former teammates: Ethan Ampadu, Ollie Watkins and Christy Pym, as well as Jordon Moore-Taylor and Moxey. Matt Grimes, once of these parts, is Swansea’s captain, and the defender Jordan Storey joined Preston from Exeter in the summer. Ampadu helped Wales to a point against Croatia in a Euro 2020 qualifier on Sunday and Brentford’s Watkins is among the Championship’s leading goalscorers. Pym is flying high with Peterborough in League One. Glancing at the academy building, Sparkes says: “You can see up there, the amount of players that have come through. It’s good for the academy as well because it brings confidence to the players coming through. Dean, similar to my position and playing with me now, has really helped me this season Pymy, I used to be really close with and he helped me a lot Ethan, I’m really good friends with him and grew up playing with him from about the age of eight Jordan, and Watkins as well – in different ways they’ve all helped me.”Sparkes is not the only academy graduate making a dent in the first team, with the 20-year-old Archie Collins also impressing. There are high hopes for Noah Smerdon, signed in the summer via the 1931 Fund, a group of 60 supporters that donates £19 per month towards a player’s wages each season. In August the England Under-15 midfielder Ben Chrisene became the club’s youngest player aged 15 years, seven months and one day, eclipsing a record held by Ampadu. “The academy makes sure your schoolwork comes first, that’s No 1,” says Sparkes. “If you’re not performing in college or when you’re in school during the under-14s, they’ll say: ‘Look, focus on that rather than football for now.’ We had lots of meetings about the importance of having something to fall back on.”Few know the pathway through to the first team better than Taylor, formerly the club’s under-23s coach. “We try and instil the right values in them from an early age. The academy and the coaches work fantastically well with the young players here to try and improve them. It is probably my job and people in and around the first team to give them that opportunity and believe in them. They are never perfect, the finished article but we give them a secure platform to go and play. The young ones will get the headlines, and rightly so, because they are our products but they are alongside some senior and experienced players.”For one of those, Lee Martin, who was born up the M5 in Taunton but raised in south London, a return to the south-west last year was welcome. “I’m probably enjoying my football the most I’ve ever done in my career,” he says. “I got a little bit off track in my early 20s, certainly after the move to Ipswich and I lost a lot of confidence and sort of just drifted through.”It is not only Exeter’s players – young and old – who are flourishing, with Taylor’s reputation as a young coach also burgeoning. Last month the club rejected an approach from Lincoln for Taylor, who spent a chunk of the summer at the Toulon Tournament in France as part of his Uefa Pro Licence course, alongside Michael Carrick, Frank Lampard and Kolo Touré. “People talk about coaches being similar to magpies, where you take the best bits out of other people, but you’re still in your own body and that’s a fantastic phrase for any up-and-coming coaches. You have to get your own experiences but also use what others do every now and then. But you have to be comfortable in your own body and stick to your own principles. We have to keep moving forward and, as a club, we feel we are doing the right things.”• Forty days after sacking Kevin Bond, Southend are seemingly no closer to finding a manager after a deal to appoint Henrik Larsson collapsed at the 11th hour. The Southend chairman, Ron Martin, was confident of appointing Larsson and his former Celtic teammate Johan Mjallby by Thursday but said the “last-minute” breakdown in talks was because Tommy Johnson, who had been in talks over a head of recruitment role, “accepted an alternative offer”. Larsson, who attended Southend’s matches against Accrington and MK Dons, told Sportbladet: “I was ready to sit on a plane, fly over and sign on.” Southend are seven points adrift of safety in League One.• If Peterborough, determined to escape League One at the sixth attempt, fail to win promotion, it is unlikely to be owing to a shortage of firepower. No player has scored more league goals this season than Ivan Toney (10), and Mo Eisa has nine and Marcus Maddison six for Darren Ferguson’s side.• Reading’s manager, Mark Bowen, has said he was “stunned” to be offered the job in the midst of shortlisting candidates to succeed José Gomes in his previous role as the club’s sporting director. “It was put to me that the least obtrusive way of doing things was: ‘Would you like the job?’” Bowen’s first game in charge is against third-placed Preston on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d92da50394a5507dc8978f0feee980448370d62/0_241_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6530d11768ce8c11f1e468f1fdea18f6","title":"pedro pasculli maradona world cup winner bangor city","story":"Pedro Pasculli shared the inner sanctum of Diego Maradona’s room when he inspired Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986. Nowadays they share a WhatsApp group called “Campeones 86” that has engaged on the unlikely topic of Bangor City since Pasculli was appointed manager of the historic but troubled club this month. The Campeones have plenty to discuss.“The sensation of holding the World Cup was like touching the sky with your hand,” the 59-year-old Pasculli recalls of the moment Maradona passed him the trophy in Mexico.The Azteca Stadium must feel every second of its 33 years away. The rain is pouring as Bangor’s manager prepares a multinational squad of part-time players for his first game in Cymru North, a 1-1 draw at Ruthin Town. Bangor is the 13th job of Pasculli’s managerial career, a varied CV that includes Albania’s Dinamo Tirana and the Uganda national team, and it is one he has taken in inauspicious circumstances.After a turbulent few years under the controversial ownership of Vaughan Sports Management Bangor reside in the second tier of the Welsh football league. The club was taken over in September by a consortium led by Domenico Serafino, an Italy-born musician who has spent most of his life in Buenos Aires. There he became friends with Sergio Batista and Jorge Luis Burruchaga, two other members of Argentina’s 1986 World Cup team, and through them he met Pasculli.Serafino discovered Bangor through his son Francesco, who joined the club in May. And so a World Cup winner and professional musician are sitting together at the EuroGold Stadium, posters of Bangor’s greatest European nights decorating the walls, discussing plans for the club’s revival. Max Leghissa, Bangor’s director of football, also sits in on the interview.“Batista and Burruchaga would come to my concerts and Fernando Batista, Sergio’s brother, trained my son at Argentinos Juniors,” Serafino says. “And Argentinos Juniors is where I first played with Maradona,” says Pasculli, who in 1985 moved to Lecce, where he became the second-highest goalscorer in the club’s history.“Then I roomed with him at the World Cup. That was a real pleasure. We were forwards together at Argentinos Juniors and even then it was clear how special he was but he never made you feel different. He was always part of the team. If you made a mistake he would always support you. He is a great man off the pitch as well as on it and he is still a real friend. We were such a close group and we are still in touch with each other today. We have a WhatsApp group called ‘Campeones 86’ that we use all the time, including Maradona.”Pasculli started Argentina’s opening game of the World Cup against South Korea, with Jorge Valdano as his strike partner. He was on the bench for the remaining group matches against Italy and Bulgaria, and the knockout rounds against England and Belgium as well as the final against West Germany, but made a decisive contribution with the winner against Uruguay in the last 16.“That goal was very important not just for getting us through but for changing the belief around us in that tournament,” he says. “It was such a big game for us, a South American derby, and Argentina hadn’t beaten Uruguay at a World Cup for 56 years. The journalists who followed the national team at that time didn’t think we’d make it through the group stage but we were the first team to arrive in Mexico and the last to leave. Uruguay were a good and hard South American team. Beating them removed a big obstacle.”Pasculli knows what is coming next and mention of “Hand of God” leaves him convulsing with laughter. He leaps from his chair to perform an impression of Peter Shilton towering above Maradona, then looking on aghast having been “pickpocketed” by Argentina’s diminutive No 10.The pressure and expectation on Maradona were intense before the final but, in the sanctuary of their hotel room, only Pasculli felt it. “Our room wasn’t anything special and our beds were near to each other. I was so anxious but Maradona said: ‘Just stay calm, we have a game tomorrow.’ Five minutes after getting in bed he was asleep! I was awake until 4 or 5am. No normal person could have slept that easily the night before a World Cup final but seeing him so calm convinced me we were going to win the World Cup.”At Bangor, you suspect, there is more convincing to do. In April a group of supporters formed their own club – Bangor 1876 – having had enough of the financial problems under VSM that prompted the Football Association of Wales to revoke Bangor’s Uefa licence and HMRC to issue a winding-up petition in 2018, later dismissed.In May the club was docked 42 points by the FAW for regulation breaches. That was reduced to 21 points after an appeal to the court of arbitration, enabling Bangor to compete in the second ision rather than third, while a transfer embargo prevented the club from signing players on professional contracts. Only one player stayed this summer while a remarkable 21 from Italy arrived, along with players from Portugal, Ghana and Guinea-Bissau plus one from Wales and six from England.“This is not about Italians coming here to work,” Serafino says. “We have had former players and Welsh players contacting us to come back since we took over. People are thinking about Bangor again as a stable club and they can see we are serious about the future. We know it is going to be difficult but we will gain the confidence of the people by working hard day after day. We plan to bring back the academy and have a community project that benefits the whole city. We will return the club to where it should be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445f3bc4dbd3985a4c293fd11f0df08261971157/37_43_2490_1494/master/2490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b63c28f9664518f53cdab10d2a52c4a","title":"who is the oldest footballer to make their debut in a top flight division knowledge","story":"Plus: more former pros turning out for Sunday league sides, eponymous international goalscorers and Derek Acorah“With Leon Clarke making his Premier League debut at the age of 34 for Sheffield United against Liverpool, who is the oldest debutant in a top ision?” tweets Joe Turner.We’ve unearthed a golden oldie who can beat the ageing Blade by two years. Now-retired Brighton defender Bruno captained the Seagulls to promotion and then made his first appearance in the English top flight at 36 and only two months shy of his 37th birthday. But Tom Aldous points us in the direction of Graham Alexander who, at the ripe age of 37, made his Premier League debut for Burnley in 2009.Italy has always been an accommodating place for footballers who have got a fair few miles on the clock, so it is little surprise that a 39-year-old made his bow in Serie A in 2016. Goalkeeper Maurizio Pugliesi turned out for Empoli against Torino in the last game of the season and ended up on the winning team too, the home side victorious 2-1.Sticking with goalkeepers, the one and only John Burridge was 43 years, four months and 26 days old when he came on as a half-time substitute for Manchester City against Newcastle United on 29 April 1995. That makes him not only the oldest Premier League player in history but also the oldest Premier League debutant. He did, however, play in the English top flight for Aston Villa way back in the 1970s.We may have a winner in Mexico, though. “In the 1993-94 Primera División, there was a rare occurrence with Humberto Filizola,” reports Milton. “He had never played football professionally, but, being president of the club Correcaminos (he was in charge because he was rector of the university to which the club belongs), he ordered Correcaminos to register him to play just one game in the top flight. On the last matchday of the season against Club América, he began the game and was replaced in the 28th minute. Filizola was 44 years old!”Better still, we’ve managed to unearth a clip from the match in question in which the game Filisola – who looks for all the world like a bus driver thrust into the starting XI – misses an absolute sitter from six yards out. Fair play to him for busting a gut to get into the box, mind – and for lasting almost half an hour.We’ve got a few more recollections of former pros trudging around amateur battlefields after their retirement …Louis Connell writes: “Former FK Viktoria Zizkov midfielder and Zimbabwe international Kennedy Chihuri plays for St Georges of Leeds in the Yorkshire Christian Football League. Not much of a step down from playing in the Champions League, then.”Chris Adams joins in: “Not strictly Sunday league, but former BuryWiganOldhameveryone striker Jason Jarrett was still playing in the Lancashire Amateur League Division One for Radcliffe St Mary’s a couple of years ago. He scored twice in one game, only to be thwarted by a great tackle from yours truly,” boasts Chris. Jarrett did in fact turn out on a Sunday … but as a referee. He gave it up in 2017 having become disillusioned with the FA pathway towards the upper echelons of officiating.“Around five or 10 years or ago, Paul Merson played a handful of games for Whitton Athletic in the Chiswick \u0026amp District Sunday League,” writes Tim Street. “Two of his sons were already playing for the same team. One of them, Sam, was very useful and has gone on to play a decent standard of non-league for Boreham Wood, Biggleswade and St Albans.”“After Beth England’s goal against Brazil on Saturday, I couldn’t help but wonder: who’s the most successful goalscorer in international football to share a name with the country they represent?” wonders Joe Reaney.“The eponymous Stephen Ireland had an impressive scoring record during his brief Republic of Ireland senior international career,” mails Sean DeLoughry. “Despite winning just six caps he scored four goals in Ireland’s challenging Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, including the only goal against Wales in Ireland’s historic first match at Croke Park. A sixth cap and fourth goal later in the campaign in Slovakia proved to be the end of a promising international career, as he went and killed off both his grandmothers before retiring from international football, aged 21.”“Did celebrity medium and former Most Haunted star Derek Acorah really play for Liverpool?” asked Steven Langfort in April 2006.For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here.“On 16 August, Bohemians beat Dublin neighbours UCD 10-1 in their record league win.

A steady stream of shelter dogs (17, to be exact) passed through the apartment. Eventually, a little mutt called Rascal became what is known as a “foster fail” – we were smitten and adopted him. A few months later, we had a “relationship fail” – we hated each other’s guts and never wanted to see each other again.We probably wouldn’t have, either, had it not been for Rascal. Neither of us could bear to give him up, so we decided to share custody.Canine co-parenting is a growing phenomenon. I don’t have official statistics to back this up, mind you, just a lot of anecdata. But it makes sense: pet ownership is growing globally and we are increasingly treating our furry friends like children. In the past few years, some US states, including California, Alaska and Illinois, have even passed legislation that means pets are treated as people – rather than property, as in the UK – in orce proceedings. This means the judge has discretion to order shared custody if they think it is in the best interest of the animal.Joint custody isn’t always easy. I have had long chats with K about the many inadequacies of her canine parenting style as you can imagine, these critiques did not go down very well. (I think she called me the technical term for a female dog.) I have had the occasional dark thought about taking her to canine court and claiming Rascal for myself. But, for the most part, the arrangement has been surprisingly wonderful. Taking care of Rascal gave us a bridge to go from bitter exes to best friends. Rascal now has one step-brother, two homes, four doting mothers and an infinite amount of attention – not to mention more treats than is probably good for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b06f6357c0e3e2a47aa62627755037d1475e00/0_0_3329_1997/master/3329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9b01c15da153d58dfcfc9ba780e909","title":"what is the truth about vaping","story":"Jamie Doward and Max Sanderson join Anushka Asthana to navigate a way through the haze of the debate around vaping.

This should help energy companies build bigger batteries faster, and at lower costs, to make help use more of the UK’s renewable electricity projects.Under separate plans the government has proposed setting out tougher minimum energy efficiency standards for rented workplaces which could put British businesses in line for savings of around £1bn a year on energy bills.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said the government would build on Britain’s track record on climate action, and “will keep on going further and faster to ensure our action meets our ambition”.The ambition was broadly welcomed by industry, but many warned that the UK needs to take action rather than rely on proposals and plans.The campaign group Transport and Environment said the plan to accelerate the transport sector’s climate agenda does not go far enough. The group said ministers should have announced a 2030 ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles, an end to the fuel duty freeze and new taxes on aviation.Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said: “When it comes to preparing for the effects of climate change, the government’s approach continues to rest on the need for further research and guidance, instead of action. Meanwhile, the country remains unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature.“The UK’s role as a genuine climate leader now rests on tangible commitments – we will be watching next month’s budget closely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10f536de3bd4c53685e516de7512a25ec64fbf1a/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d32d0d2962fa3734ff1c67a73af699","title":"nasa unveils spacesuits worn first woman moon","story":"Next-generation garments for Artemis programme will be used during 2024 lunar missionNasa has unveiled two new spacesuits designed to be worn by the first woman to walk on the moon.The next-generation suits were made for the Artemis programme, which aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024.Speaking at Nasa’s headquarters, the administrator, Jim Bridenstine, and spacesuit engineers presented the first closeup look at the suits.A bulky, mostly white prototype suit with blue and red arms was demonstrated by Kristine Davis, a spacesuit engineer at the Johnson Space Center.The garment, known as the exploration extravehicular mobility unit (xEMU), is designed for exploring the lunar surface, specifically the south pole – the target for Nasa’s next crewed lunar landing.“Kristine is wearing a spacesuit that will fit all of our astronauts when we go to the moon,” Bridenstine said. “These are our spacesuits for the Artemis generation.”The suit is more flexible than previous generation suits, allowing astronauts to squat to pick up rocks and move more easily. The insulation is designed to withstand a temperature range of -150C to 120C.“If we remember the Apollo generation, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin bunny-hopped on the surface of the moon,” Bridenstine said. “Now we are actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different from our suits of the past.”A new orange pressure suit, the Orion crew survival system, was worn by the spacesuit engineer Dustin Gohmert. It will be worn by astronauts when they launch into space on the Orion capsule and return to Earth.The focus on spacesuits designed to fit a more erse crew comes after plans for the first all-female spacewalk had to be scrapped this year because there were not enough medium-size spacesuits.Christina Koch and Anne McClain had been scheduled to step outside the International Space Station to install batteries, but in the event only Koch was able to take part in the walk.Another attempt at an all-female spacewalk, involving Nasa astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, is scheduled to take place on Thursday.

Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

After the surreal scenes of the All Blacks not being No 1 (Wales were, then Ireland!) they enter the quarter‑finals back at the top of the rankings, rated by the bookies as twice as likely to win the tournament as the second favourites. Don’t be so sure. It goes without saying they remain the best when on form, but that cancelled game might well be more of a hindrance to them than anyone, given that their last meaningful fixture will have been four weeks before their quarter‑final against Ireland. At least Italy would have been semi-meaningful. These All Blacks are not invincible at the best of times. Current world ranking: 1The same concerns apply to England. Nobody should be under any illusion that the cancelled game will help them. Their draw had been perfect, a series of Tests neatly escalating in difficulty. But when the fourth rung was removed, quite a leap was created to a quarter-final with Australia. Otherwise, England are in good shape. Defence remains a big question-mark, but defence is so 2007. Only Wales seem to bother with it these days. In attack, England are as threatening as anyone. Off-the-cuff counterattacking remains the speciality of the All Blacks, but England have developed a variety of ways to undo defences, including at the start of games when everyone is fresh and there are no excuses. Current world ranking: 3In these curious times in which New Zealand are not necessarily miles ahead, a lot of people – uncomfortable with the idea of Wales, Ireland or, God forbid, England as likely candidates – have ventured South Africa as their tip. They won the Rugby Championship this year, after all (although no team has ever won that and the World Cup in the same year). They certainly boast as formidable a tight five as any, a pleasing blend of spark and ice at half-back, and Cheslin Kolbe. Oh, Cheslin Kolbe. Defensively, though, the 2007 vintage this is not. Current world ranking: 5Which brings us to the defensive masters. We have long been told that defences win these competitions — in which case, hand the gong to Wales now. There is a sense, though, that things have changed. Wales have embarked on quite the campaign of late, gathering a grand slam, a record winning run and the kudos of being No 1 in the world — and they’ve done it with scarcely a whiff of the sort of try to quicken the pulses back home. They’ve done it with scarcely a try full stop, registering 10 of them in that grand-slam campaign – the same as Italy. But they’re still here, they’re still winning. Current world ranking: 2Japan, meanwhile, are doing so much more than win rugby matches. They are dismantling all received wisdom about how this game should be played and by whom. The hateful notion of tiers one, two and three has been exploded. As successive members of the old guard are dispatched, what should really terrify rugby’s establishment is that this team hail from a country of 125 million whose economy is the third largest in the world. If rugby can bite even modestly into Japan’s national consciousness, everything changes. A new centre of gravity could emerge to rival the current black hole that is England and France. America next. Current world ranking: 7The world rankings have received a lot of ridicule of late, never more so than when Ireland attained top spot on the eve of this competition, despite a string of recent indignities to embarrass 2018’s grand slam winners. The truth is, though, the rankings are very tight now with no one having to do much to top them – and that feels about right. Here Ireland are, sixth on our list (fourth on World Rugby’s), but they are genuinely capable of winning this thing, given a realistic upturn in form. Rugby has never had so much competition among its top teams. Current world ranking: 4And here we have Australia, World Cup finalists last time and twice champions. They too, it should not be particularly contentious to assert, are capable of winning this with a run of form. There is something by-the-seat-of-the-pants about this lot, but they will be relishing a crack at England, who seem so highly regarded after their humiliation by this side four years ago. Barely a few weeks ago Australia put nearly 50 on none other than the All Blacks. They are a long way from favourites, but an Australian triumph cannot be ruled out either. Current world ranking: 6Dare we say the same of France? No, we dare not say anything about the French. This vintage is no different from any other – mutiny in the air, players sent home under suspicious circumstances, captains dropped, games won and nearly lost, chaos all round. And yet our eighth-ranked team are thrice finalists. Some of the rugby they have played has been devastating – and not just to themselves. They will look on Wales in the quarter-finals and shrug. Win there, and neither Japan nor South Africa would quite daunt them. They will not win the tournament, surely … but, well, you get the drift. They could. Current world ranking: 8A sobering few days, but let’s be clear: no team in the top 10 would have reacted any differently to the prospect of elimination without playing. They would sit comfortably in this top eight, but that no-show against Ireland will, and should, haunt them. Current world ranking: 9Fiji too would be worthy quarter‑finalists. They have produced an astonishing array of attacking talents — and that’s not counting all those they’ve supplied to other countries. Wins against Australia or Wales would not have flattered them. Defeat by Uruguay is borderline unfathomable. Current world ranking: 11Semi-finalists last time out, and here they are in 11th. This business of fielding the same team at international level as domestic isn’t working. They could have picked some overseas players but with what message to those who stay at home? A dilemma. Current world ranking: 10Better and better with each game – oh, what would a level playing field do for these Island teams? They finally clinched that win against USA, after a whisker away against France. There are 110,000 people in Tonga. That’s the population of Chesterfield. Current world ranking: 13Europe’s answer to the Pacific Islanders, but a natural affinity for the muscular gets them only so far without the flair. Still, the same questions apply: what might they become with regular exposure? There’s no sign of any solution to that conundrum. Current world ranking: 14Authors of the second biggest upset in World Cup history. Uruguay’s overturning of a 30-point handicap with the bookies against Fiji is second only to Japan’s 42-point handicap against South Africa four years ago. Against Wales, they flirted for a while with equalling the latter upset. Incredible. Current world ranking: 18No scope for them to progress or regress. Isolated in the middle of their pool, way below the top two, way above the bottom, third was all they were ever going to get, even with a bonus two points against the All Blacks. Current world ranking: 12Disappointing. Partly because expectations were high. USA had been rising steadily through the teens in those rankings, but they were flat in their opener against England and never quite discovered themselves. A Japan-USA final in 2043, anyone? Current world ranking: 17They will always, along with Fiji and Tonga, hold the moral high ground, such are the gifts they have bestowed on a rugby world that gives so little in return. Alas, here they gave their fair share of gifts to the opposition too. Current world ranking: 15They snuck in through the back door and found themselves opening the tournament against the hosts in Tokyo. Won a lot of friends with a feisty display in defeat, including the tournament’s opening try, but that was it for them and tries. Current world ranking: 20At one point their very participation was in doubt, World Rugby concerned about the integrity of Namibia’s governing body. No doubting that of Phil Davies and his happy band. They troubled teams rated far higher. A great shame their final game against Canada was cancelled. Current world ranking: 23The decline of Canada is one of World Rugby’s more perplexing dilemmas. The former quarter-finalists should not have fallen so low. Much hope is invested in America’s new domestic league and this will hopefully help revive them, but too soon for this World Cup.

The O’Learys warned the National hero may not be risked and, further, that he may not line up unless shown leniency by the race’s weights compiler, who can, for this one race in the jumps season, adjust what the top-weighted runners have to carry in relation to others in the 40-strong field.Tinkering with the National weights was introduced by the previous chief handicapper Phil Smith but the practice has been used less in recent years after the adjustments to the fences over the years and which, from 2013, have radically altered the Aintree spectacle.Indeed, the respected ratings organisation Timeform categorically state in their new ‘Chasers \u0026amp Hurdlers’ annual, out this week, that comparisons between Tiger Roll and Red Rum are “not useful” because the “fences are a far cry from those of yesteryear”, repeating their well-rehearsed argument that since 2013 the National has taken on the defining aspects of other conventional long-distance staying chases.This year’s Aintree meeting still featured three deaths, including Up For Review at the first fence in this year’s National, and, featured, as Timeform point out, “a particularly grim sight for ITV viewers as Forest Des Aigles suffered an untreatable fracture approaching the final fence in the Topham Trophy”.Horse welfare has become an increasingly hot topic and is the burning issue that takes up the bulk of the annual’s introduction and a number of Timeform’s traditionally long essays on the leading combatants in the latest jumps season.Timeform urge the British Horseracing Authority to be more pro-active on the issue. Equine welfare is the BHA’s main priority and an industry-wide welfare strategy is expected by the year end with the way racing’s welfare standards are communicated a key part of the planned report.“The BHA pledged to ‘stay ahead of public opinion’ in the wake of the latest increase, chief executive Nick Rust being acutely aware of the power of social media,” state Timeform, who conclude: “If the BHA feels and acts as if public opinion is snapping at its heels, it runs the risk of being chased into a corner form which it cannot escape. Rather then running ahead of public opinion, the BHA perhaps needs to do more to ‘protect the brand’ and even change public opinion.” Tony PaleyTimeform’s Chasers \u0026amp Hurdlers 2018-19 is published by Portway Press at £75.Ascot has announced that the three round-course races on Saturday’s immensely valuable Champions Day card will be staged on the inner track, where hurdle races are run in the winter. The normal flat circuit remains waterlogged in places and officials now accept it will not be raceable by the weekend. This will be the first time the inner track has been used for Flat racing.Hurray for the return of jumps racing at Wetherby, where Sky Pirate (4.00) is the most interesting runner in the Bobby Renton. He took well to chasing without winning last season. Jonjo O’Neill has had this race in mind for some time, reasoning that a step back in trip might help this strong traveller. He’s 3-1 from the opening 5s.It’s disappointing that Beakstown (2.55) is odds-on from the opening 9-4 but I guess this reflects a lack of confidence that Sam Spinner, his main rival, will thrive over fences.The 11-2 is fair about Sir Egbert (5.05), who should be helped by the return of the hood and showed at times last season that his jumping can make a difference.Nottingham 1.55 Zegalo 2.30 So I Told You 3.05 King’s Charisma 3.40 Junooh 4.10 Ventura Flame 4.45 Afandem 5.15 Valentino Sunrise"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a10213e963216e67729e85b66069b738c27f82/574_633_6001_3600/master/6001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffae413a7377763b237e3279c9b1f828","title":"emoblackthot twitter paper magazine","story":"When Isaiah Hickland revealed he was behind the popular @emoblackthot Twitter account, fans felt scammed and pushback was swiftThe Twitter account @emoblackthot was a virtual therapist and best friend for over 170,000 followers – many of them people of color andor queer. She would post gentle reminders to wear sunscreen every day and stay hydrated, rave about the latest songs she was obsessed with and share her struggles with anxiety and depression. If followers were experiencing anxiety attacks, @emoblackthot was there to talk them through it over DMs.On a platform overflowing with trolls and angry callouts, @emoblackthot stood out through her promotion of self-care and vulnerability and, as a consequence, quickly became viral. There was only one problem: she was not the person she claimed to be. Until last week, it was commonly accepted that the person behind @emoblackthot was a black woman. @emoblackthot would post about alleviating her period cramps with chamomile tea, the unfair beauty standards placed on darker-skinned black women and styling her kinky 4C hair. The posts felt like they belonged to a black woman who was confident, fashionable and a tastemaker. (At one point, followers genuinely theorized that the account was run by Normani, a fast-rising R\u0026ampBpop singer, or the megastar Rihanna.)Sometimes, @emoblackthot would tweet about experiencing financial troubles and ask for donations through the Cash App. Followers, many of them black women, would happily oblige, thinking they were giving their money to a fellow black woman in need.A few months ago, @emoblackthot began teasing the reveal of her identity. She shared concerns that no one would “like” the real person behind the account. Fans quickly assuaged her fears. “Do the identity reveal,” one follower replied to a since-deleted tweet. “The opportunities that will come your way would blow your mind! i know it seems scary but trust the process. it’ll work in your favor in the end.”Last Friday morning, the reveal came. @emoblackthot chose something big and dramatic: a photoshoot and interview with the fashion magazine Paper.@emoblackthot was not Normani. Or Rihanna. Or even a black woman.“I did not envision ever revealing myself,” Hickland said to the  over email about his decision to come out. “I wanted to deactivate the account without explanation and let it die, but people relied on it for their own reasons and I didn’t want to not give them an explanation as to why the account was gone.”Hickland said he quickly received a slew of threatening and angry messages – including racial and homophobic slurs – after the reveal, which led to him deleting @emoblackthot and his personal accounts. “I fully expected to be held accountable for my wrongdoings,” he said over email. “However, I didn’t expect the amount of vitriol, lies, and hate being spread and sent my way. I feel like my life is over.” Hickland said his mental health had taken a severe hit from the online attacks.In under an hour, @emoblackthot had gone from being one of the most beloved accounts on “Black Twitter” to one of the most hated. Even popular figures were brought into the mix. After interacting with and following @emoblackthot, the R\u0026ampB singer Kehlani was forced to clarify (in a since deleted tweet) how much she knew about Hickland. “I was asked for advice on his financial situation at his day job,” she posted. “Once he told me who he was, i told him he owed it to his followers to be honest about who he was … not a publication.”Soon, Twitter users began filling in the details. They shared screenshots of him sending messages, as @emoblackthot, in private group chats meant to be exclusively for black women. The reveal made everyone involved ask who we should and shouldn’t trust on the internet.Sandra Song said she had not been aware of Hickland’s presence in private group chats when she interviewed him for Paper and found the new allegations worrisome. “Throughout our conversation, Isaiah continually emphasized that this was him coming completely clean, so we all assumed that he was being totally transparent with us,” she said.Hickland said he had nothing but good intentions with @emoblackthot.“The account began as a burner account of self-expression for me,” he said. (He denies theories that he purchased the account from someone else, possibly an actual black woman, only a few weeks ago.) Hickland originally envisioned the account as a place for him to talk about bisexuality, mental health and social injustice without worrying about ramifications in his personal life.But as the account’s popularity grew, and so did his financial troubles, Hickland toyed with the idea of using it as a launching pad for a career in the entertainment industry. He pretended to be his own manager and pitched himself to industry contacts “to see if anyone would take a chance on me”. He was desperate: “I’m in an extremely dire situation and I’ve been trying to put myself in a position to get myself out of it.” (He said any donations he received from followers were used for preparing for job interviews and on life expenses while unemployed.)Pretending to be someone else on the internet is nothing new. In many ways, digital masquerade is built into how we use the internet – whether it’s blatant catfishing, or using a picture of a K-pop singer as our avatar, or only showing the pretty parts of our lives. Social media allows for our identities to become hyper-visible, but it also allows us to adopt new ones.Dr Crystal Abidin, an anthropologist with a special focus on internet culture, said the reason an account like @emoblackthot – with its simple reminders to drink water and eat food – was able to thrive on Twitter was because of how angry content on the platform has become: “The content is novel in a space that is already so depressed.” She said influencers who place an emphasis on self-care particularly appealed to marginalized communities (as with @emoblackthot’s black female following) because the stressors of everyday life ring true. “The culture of self-care has at its ethos the feeling of being oppressed by mainstream culture.”Digital masquerade is nothing new, Abidin points out. From Lonelygirl15 to A Gay Girl In Damascus to two TikTok teens faking a gay prom proposal, there have been plenty of faked viral moments.Hickland said it was likely the @emoblackthot persona was dead forever: “For now, I just plan on detoxing, doing a lot of self reflection, finally starting therapy and figuring out the next steps to attempt to make things right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33f61829ef42adaa9eaaac2d64ecdc80186ebe14/0_187_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=034c5b8adcfdbfa0f62b2156e0dab98b","title":"glitch india biometric welfare system starvation","story":"Claimants are given a 12-digit number linked to their data, and if something goes wrong they can be refused foodMotka Manjhi had been back and forth to the ration shop four or five times, his wife said, but on each occasion he returned empty-handed. His thumbprint, needed to prove his identity, wasn’t registering on the new system.He was told to do an online update. But to do so he would need to get to a private centre – a four-mile journey from his village in Dumka, in the state of Jharkhand, north-east India. This would mean missing at least a day’s potential work, which he desperately needed to buy food. And even if he made the trek, there was no guarantee that the system, which often suffers from network outages, would be working properly. What was to be done?In the past, Manjhi and other low-income Indians only needed papers to pick up subsidised grains to feed themselves. But the welfare system in India has undergone dramatic change.Each person claimingsupport is now required to have an Aadhaar, a unique 12-digit number that is linked to their biometric and demographic data. The scheme has grown so quickly since its introduction in 2009 that it now covers more than 1.2 billion people and is the world’s largest biometric identification system.The Indian government argued that this system would revolutionise welfare: computerised checks would stop fraudsters from siphoning off other people’s benefits, allowing more money to reach the poor. But campaigners say its design is flawed and it is riddled with technological glitches. They argue it has become a Kafkaesque nightmare that has caused misery for the very people it claims to protect.Despite the serious concerns raised by economists and poverty experts, the system kept on growing and is now involved in access to anything from a pension to medical reimbursements or disaster emergency relief. Activists say in some cases parents are wrongly being asked for an Aadhaar number in order to enrol their children in school.Even if a person is lucky enough to find out what has caused the disruption, this doesn’t mean the problem will be solved. “Officials at district level or lower district level may be able to tell you why your payment has stopped they may not be able to tell you how to fix it,” Khera said.In Majhi’s case, the problem of his unrecognised thumbprint was left unresolved as he couldn’t take the time to make the trek to the centre. Meals were missed – just a few to start, then more and more often – and Manjhi became extremely thin.On 22 May he collapsed outside the family home. Neighbours rushed to help as his wife, Alabati Devi, tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance took him to hospital but it was too late. He died aged 50.No one declared the cause of his death, but the family believe it was starvation. “When he came back from looking for work he said: ‘Give me food or I will die,’” said Devi. There was nothing to give him. Hours later he fainted. All he had eaten that day was a small portion of rice and toddy palm fruit, which grows nearby their home.“He was malnourished because of the lack of the food,” said Devi, who noted he had no other illnesses.The family was living hand to mouth, said Bijay Prasad Kapi, a social activist who has supported Devi and many others. “They didn’t have any food, they couldn’t afford to store any rice. They didn’t know where to get help.” Devi was entitled to a pension but this had not arrived in her account since January.The block development officer for Majhi’s neighborhood was not reachable and the supply officer declined to comment.Activists have tracked 13 cases in Jharkhand where people who were refused support due to aadhaar glitches have allegedly died of starvation. One was an 11-year-old girl. The death of Santoshi Kumari, whose family’s ration card was cancelled because it was not linked to Aadhaar, shocked the country in 2017. Officials denied that Santoshi died of starvation and said her death was due to malaria. Other cases of alleged starvation deaths have also been denied by the government.Campaigners say the system continues to be fraught with problems. Fingerprints don’t scan properly, officials fail to offer timely assistance and internet coverage is too poor for the system to function.Pansure Murmu, who runs a ration shop in Jammu, said Aadhaar worked well on the whole, but she admitted the network signal was a problem. “We have to move the machine one or two kilometres to get the signal,” she said.Others have been known to take their customers to a hilly mound to get a signal for internet access. Residents in Lurgumi Kalan village in Mahuadanr, also in Jharkhand, went without rations for two months this summer because there was no connection, according to researchers at the campaign group Right To Food (RTF).Rice was distributed to the village only after one resident, 64-year-old Ramcharan Munda, died. Munda, who lived with his family in abject poverty in a small mud hut, had not eaten for two and a half days, activists found. Residents and the dealer had reportedly asked the administration on multiple times to revert to an offline system but this did not happen.Government officials issued a notice stating that if fingerprint scans failed, people should not be denied rations. But Ashrafi Nand Prasad, a state coordinator for RTF, said this message had not filtered down in many areas. “The local ration shop owners were not doing that,” he said. Like Manjhi, people were simply turned away with nothing.“Payments were always an issue and they were getting delayed even before Aadhaar, but one could see improvements happening for sure,” said Siraj Dutta, who works on social policy in Jharkhand. “With Aadhaar, everything went crazy and new problems came up.”Shrimati Devi, 70, who lives in Dumka, Jamma, said she had not received her 1,000-rupeesa-month pension for months. She eventually discovered that it was being paid to someone else’s bank account. Government staff told her to speak to the bank and the bank told her to speak to the inidual who was receiving her money.The problem of duplicate or fake cards, which Aadhaar promised to target, was actually “extremely negligible”, said Dutta. Corruption was happening elsewhere: grains were going missing before they reached the ration shop and dealers were fudging their records to suggest they had given plenty to customers, when actually some grains were held back.After Aadhaar was rolled out, the Jharkhand government claimed it had wiped out around 1m fake ration cards. Campaigners say many of those were genuine cards held by people who hadn’t successfully obtained an Aadhaar number and linked this to their card. A survey conducted by RTF found that of a sample of 135 cancelled ration cards, only two were declared fake and three deemed to be duplicates.Some were cancelled for not linking to Aadhaar or because the inidual had died, though the majority, 96, were scrapped without any explanation.Some states have chosen to supplement funds from central government to ensure vulnerable families are not left out Not Jharkhand, however, where some families are turned away or face long delays. Alabati Devi’s family are now getting the right support, although Kapi said they did not officially have the correct ration cards. Things changed after activists raised awareness of Manjhi’s death through the media.She expressed concern about other families in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha – India’s poorest states. “Where is the dignity in all this?

The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\u0026nbspIn late 2014, the\u0026nbspKurds were struggling\u0026nbspto fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside\u0026nbspTurkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s\u0026nbsprecent announcement\u0026nbspthat American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.The strategically located town of Manbij, a US base for three years, remains a major military target for Turkey, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said on Tuesday. Shelling between Turkish proxy Syrian rebel forces and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) positions continued at intervals throughout the day, although there have been no reports yet of fighting inside the city itself.Moscow’s special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said on Tuesday Russia opposed the Turkish operation and would not allow direct clashes between Nato member Turkey’s troops and Syrian forces. The two sides stopped short of a direct confrontation when Ankara first put boots on the ground in Syria in 2016 to seize the area around Jarablus from Isis, in the process hampering the expansion of the SDF.Erdoğan spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday about the need to prevent armed clashes between Turkish and Syrian regime troops. According to the Kremlin, Putin invited the Turkish leader for a working visit to Moscow “in the coming days” and Erdoğan accepted.As Putin exercised his enhanced influence in Syria, Washington was scrambling to limit the damage of Donald Trump’s acquiescence in the Turkish offensive. After announcing sanctions that critics described as ineffective, Trump dispatched key figures to Ankara including his vice president, Mike Pence, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, and special envoy on Syria, James Jeffrey.A White House statement said Pence would “reiterate President Trump’s commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached.”Erdoğan has so far refused to ease military operations, boasting on Tuesday that his troops had seized 1,000 sq km (400 sq miles) of territory from the SDF, an alliance that Ankara has long maintained is an offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK).The SDF was America’s ground partner in the five-year campaign against Isis and lost 11,000 troops in the long battle. Trump has attempted to rebut accusations even from his most loyal supporters that the move amounted to a betrayal.Despite the prospect of losing the area’s semi-autonomous status, Kurdish officials struck a Russian-brokered deal with Damascus on Sunday for reinforcements to protect Kurdish-held border positions. There are unconfirmed reports that talks are still under way to implement a Russian-enforced no-fly zone over the area.Syrian state media showed residents cheering the arrival of troops loyal to Assad in Manbij and Ain Issa, waving flags and throwing rice before the path of soldiers. The regime flag was also briefly raised above the famous clocktower square in Islamic State’s former capital of Raqqa on Monday night, a source in the city said, before it was taken down again by the SDF.Heavy fighting in the border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn as well as airstrikes and shelling of other Kurdish-controlled roads and towns has displaced 160,000 people from their homes and killed at least 165 civilians. SDF counterattacks over the border have left 20 Turkish civilians dead, including a Syrian baby.Erdoğan said that despite the threat of US and EU sanctions, as well as European arms embargos, Ankara would press on with the creation of a proposed 20-mile-deep (32km) “safe zone” on its border stretching from Manbij to Iraq, in which Turkey wants to resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees. Turkey denies the resettlement of mainly Arab Syrians from other parts of the country would amount to demographic engineering.The offensive has been widely condemned for precipitating a humanitarian crisis and risking the return of Isis, after about 750 people with links to the militant group took advantage of the chaos on Sunday to escape from a Kurdish-run detention camp. Footage of Syrian rebel proxies summarily executing nine Kurdish civilians on a major highway have also prompted allegations of war crimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d96284ece6ab5f8ea750f91a374a1d90c62367bc/128_0_3736_2242/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976fe4ec349993027ef5ece5e9d014a1","title":"six freed after years living in dutch cellar waiting for end of time","story":"Six adults removed from house and man, 58, arrestedA group described by local media as a man and his adult children have been found after spending several years living in the cellar of remote farmhouse in the north-eastern Dutch province of Drenthe “waiting for the end of time”.The group of six were discovered after the oldest son, 25, visited a local bar, the Kastelein cafe. On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he “ordered and drank five beers on his own”, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told broadcaster RTV Drenthe. When the man reappeared last Sunday, he “looked confused”, Westerbeek said. “He was unkempt, with long tangled hair. We got talking. He said he had run away and needed help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.”There was no indication of how long they had lived there or the whereabouts of their mother. The Algemeen Dagblad (AD) newspaper reported that police were considering the possibility that she may have died and been buried on the property.The bar owner told the local Dagblad van het Noorden newspaper that the man had said he had younger brothers and sisters living in the cellar, they all “wanted to end the way they were living”, and he had not been outside for nine years.Six adults were removed and were being taken care of, police confirmed, while a 58-year-old odd-job man who was renting the farmhouse was arrested after refusing to cooperate with their inquiry.Named by local media as Josef B, he is not the father of the young adults, according to police.Several neighbours in the village of 4,000 inhabitants told RTV Drenthe they had only ever seen a man who drove an old Volvo car on the property and assumed he lived there alone, although one said they had seen young children there some years ago and several reported hearing noises from the farm even when the man was absent.One neighbour told the Telegraaf newspaper that the man spoke German and was known in the village as “the Austrian”. The man, who reportedly moved in nine years ago, was “very sharp”, the neighbour said. “You only needed to go near the place and he’d send you packing. He watched everything through binoculars.” While Dutch media said the group were a family, a police spokeswoman refused to confirm the exact relationship or that the young adults’ father was among them, saying the investigation was ongoing.“Our primary concern is for the family members,” she said. “What exactly happened in the farmhouse is still very unclear. We are exploring all possible scenarios.”Citing unnamed sources, RTV Drenthe said that police had found a hidden staircase leading to the family’s hiding place behind a cupboard in the living room. The father was bedridden having suffered a stroke some years ago, it said. The children were aged between 16 and 25.Dutch media said the group appeared to have had little or no contact with the outside world and lived a largely self-sufficient life, apparently growing their own vegetables and keeping a goat and geese.The farmhouse owners, Klaas and Alida Rooze, told AD: “We knew absolutely nothing of this. We had rented the house for years to an inidual and now we learn that a man was living there with children. We have no idea who this can be.”The local mayor, Roger de Groot, told a press conference the situation was extraordinary and that he could give few further details. “For the moment, the police have a lot of unanswered questions,” he said, adding that most of the family appeared not to be registered with local authorities.Police had “assessed the situation and found a number of rooms with makeshift furnishings where a family was living an isolated existence,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fafaed6d8c2c2de39fc5c14680095a872a249ba0/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2c5fa3c4f1d5eebeb522b8809d8830","title":"kim jong un jockeys for attention with horse ride up sacred mountain","story":"North Korean leader’s heavily publicised trip up Mount Paektu on white horse could be sign of a big decisionKim Jong-un is planning “a great operation to strike the world with wonder”, North Korean state media has said, after he found inspiration during a heavily publicised horse ride to the top of the nation’s most sacred mountain.In a series of photos released by state news agency KCNA, Kim is seen riding a large white horse through snowy fields and woods on Mount Paektu, the spiritual homeland of the Kim dynasty.“His march on horseback in Mt Paektu is a great event of weighty importance in the history of the Korean revolution,” KCNA said.“Having witnessed the great moments of his thinking atop Mt Paektu, all the officials accompanying him were convinced with overflowing emotion and joy that there will be a great operation to strike the world with wonder again and make a step forward in the Korean revolution.”It was unclear what the operation might involve, but Kim has often made trips to the sacred mountain at times of major policy endeavours.Analysts say the symbolism underscores North Korea standing up to international sanctions and pressure over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.“This is a statement, symbolic of defiance,” said Joshua Pollack, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. “The pursuit of sanctions relief is over. Nothing is made explicit here, but it starts to set new expectations about the coming course of policy for 2020.”In late 2017, Kim visited Mount Paektu days after North Korea launched its largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and weeks before he made a key New Year speech in which he opened the door to engagement with South Korea.Last year, Kim took South Korean president Moon Jae-in to the top of the mountain as part of a historic summit.Since then, relations have cooled and Kim has said he will wait only until the end of the year for the US to soften its stance in denuclearisation negotiations before North Korea pursues an unspecified new path forward.Further afield, Kim’s latest trip sparked a raft of comparisons to western books, movies and TV series, including Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia.Several experts said much of the rhetoric in the KCNA report revolves around the economy, and they suspect North Korea may soon conduct a space launch. That would enable the North to show its economic and technological power in a less provocative way than by testing an ICBM.Rachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea, said: “The report in Korean has characterised Kim’s climb up to Mount Paektu on horseback as a new ‘myth’, and that, together with the images of him on a white horse, appear to have been designed to create maximum propaganda effect, which I believe media will play up in the days to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4069afd531c9d32909bd7592c0daea956d65b9b4/638_451_2458_1475/master/2458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d71abab075febe544a3c4fa0eebdf4c","title":"panama papers law firm mossack fonseca sues netflix over the laundromat","story":"Partners Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca want US court to stop the film being released on FridayThe partners of the offshore law firm whose confidential files were exposed in the Panama Papers leak, Mossack Fonseca, have launched defamation action against Netflix over a movie about the scandal that is due to be released on Friday.In a US lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca say The Laundromat, in which they are respectively played by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, portrays them as “ruthless uncaring lawyers who are involved in money laundering, tax evasion, bribery andor other criminal conduct” and ask the court to stop it from being screened.In documents filed to the court they say the release of the film is likely to subject them to “additional bail andor conditions for each new crime imputed to them in the movie” in Panama, where they are set to go on trial on charges related to the law firm.And it would also interfere with their right to a fair trial in the US, where they are under investigation by the FBI, they said in a legal memorandum filed with the district court in Connecticut.“Once the cat is out of the bag, it is impossible to put it back without the consequence of tainting a verdict,” they say in the documents.“This is especially true where the cat is named ‘Laundromat’ and the charges would include money laundering.”Mossack and Fonseca complain that the trailer for the film, which also stars Meryl Streep as a woman who has lost her husband in a boat accident, makes them out to be “villains profiting from the death of 20 people killed in the small town boat tour”.They also complain about scenes in the film featuring the pair’s fictionalised alter egos capering in suits covered in currency symbols and showing a sheikh, Russian gangsters and others saying “‘shit’ andor other expletives in different languages” when the files are exposed.“The implications and innuendo converge to cast plaintiffs in the light of mastermind criminals whose crimes include, but are not limited to, murder, bribery, money laundering andor corruption,” Mossack and Fonseca say in the court documents.“Ultimately, at the hands of the defendant, the plaintiffs unwarrantedly solidify a global finance role as poster children for money laundering and tax evasion, complete with a logo that the defendant ensures will guarantee a mental association with crime and corruption,” Mossack and Fonseca say in the documents.They also attacked the director, Steven Soderbergh, for using offshore film finance vehicles and his press statements that the film did not portray the pair as villains.“To claim that Mossack and Fonseca and their law firm are not villains in the movie is a cataclysmic understatement, which stands in wholly stark contrast to gist of the movie and the commentary by movie reviewers,” they said in their legal memo.Netflix, which has been approached for comment, is yet to file a defence and a date for a hearing has not been set.Mossack Fonseca shut down in March last year, two years after the release of the Panama Papers thrust the affairs of their clients onto front pages around the world.The 11.5m documents in the cache named a large number of rich and powerful people, sparking investigations around the world.In addition to the Panamanian charges against Mossack and Fonseca, which they are fighting, four men associated with the firm have been charged with tax crimes in the US."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4052254.1571210419!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ticket scramble in japan as irish fans seek swaps for new zealand game","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCork man Cian Alcock at An Solas bar in Tokyo. Along with thousands of others, he hopes to secure a ticket for Ireland’s clash with the All Blacks on Saturday. Photograph: courtesy Cian Alcock. As a diehard rugby fan, Cian Alcock moved to Tokyo and got a job pulling pints to support his World Cup adventure.Unfortunately, when he handed over €1,000 for a premium ticket to the quarter-final he picked the wrong game.It was a mistake repeated by thousands of Irish fans. Those expecting the team to top their pool and face South Africa in the quarter-final booked their seats well in advance. In the end, Japan’s wins over Ireland, and\u0026nbspScotland last weekend, means Ireland face New Zealand instead.Even if the Irish players rally to a World Cup upset on Saturday, many of the travelling fans are unlikely to be there.This Friday offers some hope. A meet-up between Irish and Japanese fans appears to have been organised in order to swap tickets - Japan now face South Africa so it should be a win-win for fans but nobody is taking anything for granted.“I have spent a fortune. I was only going to go to one game,” said Alcock who previously based himself in New Zealand for the 2011 World Cup.“I have spent €1,000 for a premium ticket but it’s for the wrong game. Disaster.”Like everybody else in the same predicament, the Cork native has looked at the rugby swap Facebook page where everyone is trying to offload their tickets. There is “very little chance” he says with an air of resignation.PandemoniumIn the first five hours of a quiet Tuesday evening shift in Tokyo at least a dozen fans came into An Solas asking, he says.Exchanges between those who have tickets for the Japan versus South Africa game, but who wish to see the Ireland game, and fans on the other side of the conundrum now appears the most likely option.The Facebook Ticket Exchange page has advertised a three hour event this Friday while activity online has already pitched huge demand against limited supply.Those with, and looking for, tickets have been advertising what they have and what they want. By Tuesday evening more than 1,000 people had interacted with the page.The like-for-like, transactional nature of where fans find themselves is illustrated in the posts. “We have two category D tickets seated together for Sunday’s Japan Vs South Africa game in Tokyo and want to swap for two seated together tickets for Ireland Vs New Zealand on Saturday,” wrote one.The site warns hopeful fans against dealing with certain traders while other titbits of advice includes bringing passports to an exchange as identification and only trading in tickets bought through the official World Cup website. Others warn against making money transfers, sticking instead to face-to-face deals.The stakes are high given the figures quoted on resale websites. On Viagogo, single tickets were selling for between €795 and €2,040 on Tuesday evening. The site warned they were swapping hands quickly, unlike other World Cup fixtures, and in one hour almost 1,000 people had viewed what was on offer.On the Stubhub site, advertised prices ranged from €727 to €2,500. Tickets advertised for almost €700 were already sold out."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will bePreparation can help you take full advantage of open day opportunities"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Negotiations continue on final day of efforts to get deal ready for crucial EU summitStudy examined 101 domestic fires between 2014 and 2016 that resulted in 106 fatalities\u0026lsquoThere is still more time,\u0026rsquo Varadkar tells conferenceSix units of fire brigade on scene of fire in Artane which began at 6.10amWilliam Rowan Hamilton scratched his equation on north Dublin bridge in 1843Rugby World Cup: Cian Alcock spent \u0026euro1000 on ticket to quarter-final - but now his seat is for the wrong gameIrish Medical Organisation says proposals \u0026lsquomaking the situation worse, not better\u0026rsquoOne in three \u0026lsquonot that worried\u0026rsquo about climate change, Ipsos MRBI poll findsIrish Kidney Association chief to address issue before Oireachtas health committeeIncrease of 30c will only be introducted in event of orderly Brexit, D\u0026aacuteil hearsAudit to examine oversight procedures board governance and fraud-reporting systemsConcern expressed over lack of \u0026lsquorigorous and attractive\u0026rsquo vocational segment in senior cycle\u0026lsquoBehind-closed-doors\u0026rsquo meetings with Government will explore US agendaVacuum being filled with far-right \u0026lsquoinfiltrators\u0026rsquo, particularly online, says McMahonOughterard locals \u0026lsquoused\u0026rsquo by outside elements pursuing political agenda, retired judge saysWaiting lists for children and adults with intellectual disabilities growing, says CopeRespondents split over willingness to pay more for fossil fuels to tackle problemNicholas Keogh made protected disclosure about alleged collusion with drug dealerDublin north and Cork-Kerry waiting lists are \u0026lsquoparticularly appalling\u0026rsquo says Shortall"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051707.1571167176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"derry woman considers un complaint over uk citizenship ruling","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma DeSouza and her US born husband Jake.Ms DeSouza is considering further legal action. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireAn Irish woman who lost a ruling identifying her as British by birth under UK law is exploring whether she can lodge a complaint to the UN over a breach of the 1998 Belfast Agreement.Co Derry woman Emma DeSouza, an Irish citizen, won a case against the UK Home Office in 2017 after it deemed her British through her birth in Northern Ireland following an application from her US-born husband for a residence card.She argued that the 1998 peace agreement had allowed her to identify as British, Irish or both. On Monday an immigration tribunal sided with the UK Home Office in an appeal on the earlier ruling. She plans to appeal the ruling to the Court of Appeal and, if required, to the Supreme Court. Ms DeSouza has accused the British government of failing to comply with the Belfast Agreement by failing to legislate for the peace treaty in domestic UK law over the past two decades and to protect the birthright of people in Northern Ireland to be Irish. She lost her case on the basis of a 1981 UK nationality law.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar backed her case. He told the Dáil that he believed British citizenship laws are “out of step” with the 1998 accord “making a distinction between how people identify as to their citizenship”.Mr Varadkar said the agreement was “eloquent” on the right of people in Northern Ireland to be British, Irish or both and to be accepted as such. “That is the spirit and letter of the Good Friday agreement,” he said.The Derry woman said she was examining whether she could lodge a complaint to the UN over her fundamental rights to self-determination and to be free from discrimination.“I am starting to look into whether I can as an Irish citizen lodge a complaint to the UN and I believe I can as an Irish citizen,” she said.She referred to the complaints made by two Irish women who took cases to the UN Human Rights Committee claiming their rights had been infringed by Ireland’s ban, since lifted, on abortion. Ms DeSouza believes that her case “could go all the way” to the European Court of Justice given that the UK government could be denying her access to EU rights as an Irish citizen after Brexit. Bilateral meetingMr Varadkar said he would raise the case with UK prime minister Boris Johnson later this week and that Tánaiste Simon Coveney would speak to Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith about it. The Taoiseach said the British government had agreed to “review and resolve the issue” in line with the letter and spirt of the Belfast Agreement. London has yet to publish its review of the issue. “This judgment appears to make a distinction between identifying as British or Irish as opposed to being a citizen and that is a misreading, in our view, of the Good Friday agreement,” he said.Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, urged the UK government to publish its “promised review” and to implement a Bill of rights for Northern Irish people or “to effectively incorporate the intentions of the Good Friday agreement into UK law”.“We shouldn’t have to wait for the judges to decide this in the Court of Appeal or possibly even in the Supreme Court eventually, which will take a very long period of time,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051724.1571168083!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emma desouza you can t get on with your life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma DeSouza and her husband Jake.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireEmma DeSouza and her US-born husband Jake thought someone at the UK Home Office had made a mistake when it refused him a residence card in 2016 because she had not renounced her British citizenship.Their application had been lodged on the basis that Emma, from Magherafelt in Co Derry, was an Irish national, as is her right under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, an international peace treaty.The Home Office said she first had to renounce her status as a British citizen and could then reapply.“Until that status is renounced, she is as a matter of fact a British citizen,” the Home Office told him in its September 2016 letter.“We thought it was a clerical error and it would be quickly overturned because everyone in Northern Ireland could be Irish or British or both,” the Derry woman said.An Irish woman being automatically identified as British was at odds, they felt, with the 1998 agreement protecting the Derry woman’s birthright to be Irish.It was not an error by the Home Office.“We just felt that they couldn’t get away with that and that nobody else should have to go through it. The whole thing just shouldn’t be happening,” she told The .‘Devastated’Four years after first applying, a UK immigration tribunal this week backed the Home Office. The couple spoke of being “devastated” at the ruling and the “personal cost” of the long-running legal battle.The Home Office had Jake DeSouza’s passport for almost two years and warned that if he left the country his application would be void.“The biggest loss will always remain that we did not get to see my husband’s grandmother before she passed away. We had three months of her on her deathbed,” she said.“We knew she wasn’t going to make it. Over those three months we tried desperately to get Jake out of the country.”The case has been “all consuming” in their lives, she said, with “the impending doom of another court case somewhere in the distance”.“You can’t get on with your life and be a normal married couple,” said Emma.Despite the toll taken on the couple, they are determined to continue fighting their case.“When you have invested four years, it is definitely not something that you are going to walk away from,” she said.DeSouza feels that this week’s ruling sets a precedent that “rewrites” a key provision of the Belfast Agreement and could restrict the rights of people in Northern Ireland post-Brexit.“There are all kinds of knock-on effects from that judgment that really put us in a position where we have no choice but to appeal it,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051237.1571147519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer what is the emma desouza case about","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma DeSouza and her US born husband Jake . Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireWhat is the Emma DeSouza case about?It concerns the right of people in Northern Ireland to be considered Irish from birth under the terms of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday agreement, the international accord that props up the Northern Ireland peace process. What does the agreement say about this?It recognises the birthright of people in Northern Ireland to identify and to be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may chose, and accordingly confirms that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both the British and Irish governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.Who is Emma DeSouza?Emma DeSouza is from Magherafelt in Co Derry and applied for a residence card for her US-born husband Jake to live and work in Northern Ireland in 2015 - the same year they were married in Belfast. She identified herself as an Irish citizen in the application.Why did she bring a legal case?She took the case after the UK Home Office rejected the application on the basis that it considered DeSouza a British citizen because she was born in Northern Ireland. She was told she could reapply identifying herself as British or renounce her UK citizenship and reapply as an Irish citizen. She claimed she never considered herself British so she could not renounce a citizenship she never had. She later said that she had “discovered that my lifelong Irish identity is evidently considered secondary to an unclaimed British identity.” What was this week’s ruling about?DeSouza lost an appeal taken by the Home Office against an earlier immigration tribunal ruling that initially found in her favour. The First Tier Immigration Tribunal ruled in 2017 that she was an “Irish national only who has only ever been such.” The Home Office appealed this decision to the Upper Tribunal and won this week. What does the ruling mean?It means that people born in Northern Ireland remain British citizens under UK law even if they identify as Irish. The UK government’s lawyers argued successfully that the British National Act 1981, not law flowing from the 1998 Belfast Agreement, covered this. But does this not contravene the 1998 Belfast Agreement?DeSouza argues that it does. She has accused the British government of failing to honour the spirit of a commitment in the 1998 peace agreement that people born in Northern Ireland could identify as British, Irish or both.How has anomaly arisen between the law and the peace agreement?DeSouza along with human rights campaigners and commentators, legal and otherwise, in Northern Ireland have argued that successive British governments have failed to legislate to give full effect to the peace agreement.Does any of this have anything to do with Brexit?It is a separate matter but related to Brexit given that the ruling comes against the backdrop of uncertainty around how Northern Ireland citizens will be treated after the UK leaves the EU given that people in Northern Ireland who identify as Irish, in turn, consider themselves EU citizens. DeSouza and human rights advocates in Northern Ireland claim that Brexit complicates matters because the automatic conferral of British citizenship on Irish citizens could be used to restrict and remove their access to EU rights and entitlements.

File photograph: Nick BradshawA majority of voters believe climate change is the most serious issue facing the world – but they are not convinced about carbon tax increases, and a substantial minority are sceptical about the urgency of the problem. The findings are from the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll, taken among 1,200 voters from Friday to Sunday.More than half of all voters (55 per cent) said they agree that climate change “is the most serious issue facing the world”, with 36 per cent disagreeing with the statement.A similar percentage of voters (54 per cent) said they were prepared to reduce their standard of living to combat climate change. However, when asked specifically if they were willing to pay more for fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel to tackle climate change, almost half of voters (48 per cent) said no. And voters do not want the Government to spend money on climate change at the expense of public services – 56 per cent disagree with the proposal to spend more money on climate change and less on public services. And just one-third of voters said they were not “that worried” about climate change.Asked about the statement “I don’t think climate change will be as bad as people say so I’m not that worried about it” 57 per cent disagreed, while 33 per cent agreed. Voters were offered a series of statements and asked whether they agreed or disagreed.On “I am okay with reducing my standard of living in order to help tackle climate change”, 54 per cent agreed and 36 per cent disagreed. However, when asked about specific measures – such as increases in fossil fuel prices – almost half said they disagreed with the idea. Those most convinced of the urgency of climate change tend to be younger, urban and better-off voters. Those less likely to be worried about it – and so less convinced of the need for action – tended to be older, rural, less well-off voters. Farmers were most sceptical about action on climate. Among the parties, Sinn Féin voters were the least supportive."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4052449.1571221295!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach hopeful of brexit deal by end of week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar delivers his address on Ireland’s Agri-Food Strategy to 2030 at the Aviva stadium in Dublin. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he spoke to UK prime minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission on Wednesday and remained confident a Brexit deal could be got across the line this week.Speaking at a conference on the future of Irish agriculture at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, he said there was progress but there were many issues that remain to be fully resolved, “particularly around the consent mechanism, and also some issues around customs and VAT”.He was convinced all parties are serious about getting an agreement this week “or at least if not this week, by the end of the month”.Mr Varadkar hoped the issues could be resolved on Wednesday in time to ratify an agreement at European Council on Thursday and allowing the House of Commons to give its verdict on Saturday.“But if it’s not, there is still more time. October 31st is still a few weeks away. There is the possibility of an additional summit, if we need that,” he added.‘Twists and turns’He said that while there had been many “twists and turns” over the past three years, Ireland’s simple objectives remained the same avoid a hard North-South border ensure the all-Ireland economy continues to thrive and prosper, resume North-South co-operation and protect the integrity of the single market - “and our place in it”.Although time was running short, he remained confident that these objectives could be achieved. Ireland, nonetheless, had to prepare for the worst case scenario, he said.Whatever form of Brexit emerges, Ireland’s relationship with the UK will be different, he stressed. Mr Varadkar was hopeful there would be no tariffs “but there might be”. He hoped there would be no change in regulations or standards, “but there probably will be”.As the UK leaves the EU and starts to do trade deals elsewhere, there would be displacement of some Irish products from the UK market. “So we need to face up to all of that, and deal with it, and respond. And I believe we can.”The one certainty was that Ireland would stay in the EU and have the benefits of a marketplace with 400 million people, he pointed out.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Peter GallagherTwitter.Most graffiti does not stand the test of time but one ‘Eureka moment’ 176 years ago, when an equation was scratched on a bridge in North Dublin, proves the exception. What’s more, the mathematical equation, written using a penknife by the noted Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton, is set to be preserved for many years to come – thanks to the latest work of tattoo artist Emma Ray. Well-known local and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe unveiled the work on Wednesday, on what is Hamilton Day, at Broombridge Luas stop. It celebrates that 176-year-old act of graffiti. On October 16th, 1843, Hamilton and his wife Helen were walking along the banks of the Royal Canal from Dunsink Observatory to the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) where he was president.At Broome Bridge, he had that very rare occurrence in science, a Eureka moment. He suddenly alighted on the solution to a problem he had been working on for a long time and in his excitement, he scratched his formula for Quaternion algebra onto the bridge i²  j²  k²  ijk  -1. Quaternions would later be instrumental in putting the first man on the moon and be used for computer-generated imagery in movies.In 2018, the RIA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority decided to mark this important moment in world science by commissioning an artwork for the Luas stop through a competition open to students, staff and alumni of the nearby TU Dublin School of Creative Arts. Ms Ray, a former DIT fine art student who is based in Dundalk, Co Louth, won the commission. “We in Cabra have always had great pride in the story of William Rowan Hamilton’s Eureka moment. This stop is fondly referred to by locals as the ‘Luas Hamilton’ so it is wonderful to launch this artwork by Emma Ray today,” Mr Donohoe said.“The artwork is the story of his walk on October 16th, 1843 and how the answer came to him in a flash and probably when he least expected it,” RIA president Prof Peter Kennedy said. “Dublin and especially Cabra should be proud of William Rowan Hamilton. We want this artwork to inspire the next generation. Dublin needs new Hamiltons,” Prof Kennedy said.

Photograph: Christophe Petit TessonEPAThe Irish Government has been praised in Paris for its conduct throughout the Brexit saga.“Dublin in a position of strength,” said a headline in Le Monde following Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s meeting with prime minister Boris Johnson last Thursday.The UK repeatedly made the mistake of trying to “bilateralise” Brexit negotiations, an adviser to French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday, while pointing out that EU unity did not preclude contacts between political leaders. For example, Macron spoke to Johnson on the telephone on Tuesday morning.“When Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar saw each other a few days ago, Ireland played the European game perfectly,” the adviser at the Élysée said. “Mr Johnson made political overtures, and it was referred to the 27 for negotiations. It’s not Mr Varadkar or the Irish team negotiating with the British today. It’s Michel Barnier and his team.”‘Supported’The Élysée sees EU solidarity with Ireland as a shining lesson of the benefits of EU membership. “It is the profound meaning of the EU project that a member state which is in difficulty, whether it be an attack, an economic threat or a political difficulty, must be supported by the others,” the adviser said.“If belonging to the EU means anything, it is that there must be no ambiguity or hesitation about protecting the fundamental interests of a member state, and that is valid whatever the size of the country. It is valid for a country of five million inhabitants, like Ireland.”The fact that the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the EU’s only land border with Britain was “the second reason why Ireland was at the heart of the negotiations”, the adviser added.Though the Élysée hoped for an imminent agreement, the adviser warned that the summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday must not be “a catch-up session or the continuation of technical or detailed negotiations. It will be the moment to endorse or formalise a political agreement, but in no event a nocturnal extension of tough negotiations”.Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel will co-ordinate their positions at a Franco-German cabinet meeting in Toulouse on Wednesday, where they will be joined by their ministers for defence, foreign affairs, European affairs, finance, culture and the interior.The meeting will focus on trade tensions with the US and co-operation in industry and innovation, in particular artificial intelligence and military procurement. Paris and Berlin are developing a combat aircraft and a battle tank together.Toulouse is the site of the Airbus 350 assembly line, considered one of the most successful Franco-German projects.International eventsFranco-German relations are often rendered difficult because of international events external to them, the adviser said. “It’s the situation that is difficult, not France and Germany. ”Macron’s approach has been to attempt to reach compromise on areas of discord, such as the reform of the euro zone, not to paper over disagreement.The French president believes “there is no alternative or possible substitute for the Franco-German relationship. It is irreplaceable,” the adviser continued. But, at the same time, it is “not an exclusive relationship”. Under Macron, “France is working much more with other partners, for example the Netherlands and central Europe, than before.”Macron received a stinging rebuke from the European Parliament when it vetoed the appointment of Sylvie Goulard as a member of the European Commission. Macron had secured a weighty portfolio for her, including the internal market, industry, defence, space, digital technology and culture.The Élysée said the attributes of the portfolio reserved for France must not change. Macron wants the “political instability” of the parliament, which has no clear political majority, to be addressed before he chooses a new commissioner.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track. The actor had become so obsessed with the role that he ended up learning fifty of Morrison\u0027s songs and had everyone call him Jim on set of the 1991 biopic.Johnny Depp risked his life while preparing for the role of Hunter Thompson in Terry Gilliam\u0027s 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he took hard drugs and spent his nights sleeping next to extremely dangerous containers of gunpowder and nitroglycerin.For war thriller Fury (2014), Shia LaBeouf slashed his own cheek and pulled a tooth out during filming. He also didn\u0027t wash for an entire month forcing the crew to arrange a separate room for him during night-time shoots.Rooney Mara completely changed her image to play the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher\u0027s 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She cut her hair, bleached her eyebrows and pierced her nipples to get into the mindset of the cyber hacker at the heart of Stieg Larrson\u0027s novels.Natalie Portman certainly worked for the Best Actress Oscar she received for 2010 film Black Swan. She shunned any suggestion of a body double for the film\u0027s extremely challenging dance scenes.In 2008, Joaquin Phoenix displayed some bizarre behaviour after\u0026nbsphe quit acting to become a hip-hop artist. It was later revealed that his life upheaval –\u0026nbspstrange interviews included – was, in fact, a giant hoax for mockumentary I\u0027m Still hereAfter hearing that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had a diet comprised of just fruit, Ashton Kutcher thought he\u0027d do the same in preparation for his role in biopic Jobs (2013). He ended up hospitalised for severe vitamin deficiencies as well as a reduction in bone density.After begging Spike Lee to let her play the role of crack addict Vivian in his 1991 film Jungle Fever, Halle Berry proved her dedication to the role by refusing to bathe for two whole weeks.Meryl Streep has recounted the time Dustin Hoffman slapped her on their first take filming 1979 orce drama Kramer vs Kramer, something everyone can agree was an unacceptable step too far.Known to be one of the biggest method actors around, Daniel Day-Lewis spent six months alone in the wilderness in preparation for his role in The Last of the Mohicans (1992).Anne Hathaway may have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Misérables (2012), but the role of Fantine – which saw her cut off her hair and eat nothing but lettuce and oatmeal paste – left her in a state of deprivation, both physically and emotionally.Christian Bale has since vowed not to mess with his weight again following his Oscar win for Vice earlier this year but, back in 2004, he lost such an alarming amount of weight for the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist that he became virtually unrecognisable. I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I\u0027ve been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits, he went on to tell the BBC.While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it\u0027s her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film. DeVito went so far as to dream up an imaginary friend, one he became convinced was real.To get into the lead role of Oscar-winning film The Pianist (2002), Adrien Brody upheaved his life so much that it took him over a year and a half to get things back on track not only did he starve himself to a staggering degree, but sold his home and broke up with his long-term girlfriend.   The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016\u0027s Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew.Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family. She compared leaving the character behind her to escaping a serious car crash.For Taxi Driver, most actors wouldn\u0027t have  got themselves a fake license and cruised around New York City throughout the night to get into the role of the deranged Travis Bickle, but that\u0027s precisely what Robert De Niro ended up doing in 1976.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011). Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track.

He also didn\u0027t wash for an entire month forcing the crew to arrange a separate room for him during night-time shoots.Rooney Mara completely changed her image to play the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher\u0027s 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She cut her hair, bleached her eyebrows and pierced her nipples to get into the mindset of the cyber hacker at the heart of Stieg Larrson\u0027s novels.Natalie Portman certainly worked for the Best Actress Oscar she received for 2010 film Black Swan. She shunned any suggestion of a body double for the film\u0027s extremely challenging dance scenes.In 2008, Joaquin Phoenix displayed some bizarre behaviour after\u0026nbsphe quit acting to become a hip-hop artist. It was later revealed that his life upheaval –\u0026nbspstrange interviews included – was, in fact, a giant hoax for mockumentary I\u0027m Still hereAfter hearing that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had a diet comprised of just fruit, Ashton Kutcher thought he\u0027d do the same in preparation for his role in biopic Jobs (2013). He ended up hospitalised for severe vitamin deficiencies as well as a reduction in bone density.After begging Spike Lee to let her play the role of crack addict Vivian in his 1991 film Jungle Fever, Halle Berry proved her dedication to the role by refusing to bathe for two whole weeks.Meryl Streep has recounted the time Dustin Hoffman slapped her on their first take filming 1979 orce drama Kramer vs Kramer, something everyone can agree was an unacceptable step too far.Known to be one of the biggest method actors around, Daniel Day-Lewis spent six months alone in the wilderness in preparation for his role in The Last of the Mohicans (1992).Anne Hathaway may have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Misérables (2012), but the role of Fantine – which saw her cut off her hair and eat nothing but lettuce and oatmeal paste – left her in a state of deprivation, both physically and emotionally.Christian Bale has since vowed not to mess with his weight again following his Oscar win for Vice earlier this year but, back in 2004, he lost such an alarming amount of weight for the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist that he became virtually unrecognisable. I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I\u0027ve been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits, he went on to tell the BBC.While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it\u0027s her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them.

If Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of this month, house prices will end the year 1.7 per cent lower than in 2018, said Standard \u0026amp Poor’s (S\u0026ampP), one of the world’s three biggest providers of government and company credit scores to investors.Prices will then tumble another 10.2 per cent in 2020 and another 6.1 per cent in 2021, S\u0026ampP said in a report on Tuesday. House values will start rising again in 2022, but a predicted 5.9 per cent increase that year will undo only some of the previous losses.Although S\u0026ampP’s forecasts are at the gloomier end of recent predictions, many organisations expect substantial declines in UK house prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Last month, KPMG said prices could fall by around 6 per cent in 2020 in that case, “with a drop of 10-20 per cent not out of the question” if the market reacts more strongly than the consultancy projects.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureKPMG’s prediction is in line with no-deal expectations by the government’s spending watchdog: in July the Office for Budget Responsibility said house prices will drop by 5.9 per cent in 2020.On the other hand, if a Brexit agreement is struck before 31 October, the housing market will avoid slipping into the red, according to S\u0026ampP. It sees a 1.5 per cent price rise in 2020 after stagnation this year.“We believe that Brexit uncertainty has already started to trickle down into lower housing prices and sales volumes, especially in London,” the agency said.According to the latest official data, house prices inched up by 0.7 per cent in July compared with a year earlier – the slowest pace of growth in almost seven years. Figures for August are due on Wednesday.The sluggish growth in prices will be welcomed by those yet to get onto the housing ladder.“House prices have been expensive here for quite some time,” Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said earlier on Tuesday, adding that housing affordability is “a challenge”.“It’s first and foremost driven by supply dynamics in the country. It continues to strike me that there is twice as many people in the United Kingdom as there is in my native Canada and the same amount of houses are built every year in the United Kingdom as in Canada.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureKPMG’s prediction is in line with no-deal expectations by the government’s spending watchdog: in July the Office for Budget Responsibility said house prices will drop by 5.9 per cent in 2020.On the other hand, if a Brexit agreement is struck before 31 October, the housing market will avoid slipping into the red, according to S\u0026ampP. It sees a 1.5 per cent price rise in 2020 after stagnation this year.“We believe that Brexit uncertainty has already started to trickle down into lower housing prices and sales volumes, especially in London,” the agency said.According to the latest official data, house prices inched up by 0.7 per cent in July compared with a year earlier – the slowest pace of growth in almost seven years. Figures for August are due on Wednesday.The sluggish growth in prices will be welcomed by those yet to get onto the housing ladder.“House prices have been expensive here for quite some time,” Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said earlier on Tuesday, adding that housing affordability is “a challenge”.“It’s first and foremost driven by supply dynamics in the country. It continues to strike me that there is twice as many people in the United Kingdom as there is in my native Canada and the same amount of houses are built every year in the United Kingdom as in Canada.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Net revenue at Goldman’s investing and lending ision slumped 40 per cent as it swallowed a loss of about $80m (£63m) on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company, along with hits from investments in Uber and two other companies.The valuation of WeWork, an office-sharing startup, has plummeted from a peak of $47bn in January to as low as $10-12bn, forcing it to pull its IPO. Meanwhile, Uber’s shares are down 24 per cent since the company went public earlier this year.The only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but 6 per cent growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in other major businesses.“Overall, GS posted mixed results this quarter,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette \u0026amp Woods said in a note to clients.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A fireman extinguishes a fire near Beirut.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.“We are very proud of our members today. They have stood by their union in record numbers and given hope to workers across the nation.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Net revenue at Goldman’s investing and lending ision slumped 40 per cent as it swallowed a loss of about $80m (£63m) on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company, along with hits from investments in Uber and two other companies.The valuation of WeWork, an office-sharing startup, has plummeted from a peak of $47bn in January to as low as $10-12bn, forcing it to pull its IPO. Meanwhile, Uber’s shares are down 24 per cent since the company went public earlier this year.The only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but 6 per cent growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in other major businesses.“Overall, GS posted mixed results this quarter,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette \u0026amp Woods said in a note to clients.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A fireman extinguishes a fire near Beirut.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.Both she and co-star Nicole Kidman, who negotiated their salaries together, received enormous salary bumps from broadcaster HBO after earning a far lower $250,000 and $300,000 per episode for the show’s first season.The Morning Show, which will run for two seasons consisting of 10 episodes each, debuts on the new Apple TV streaming service on 1 November.Aniston yesterday joined Instagram.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said Royal Mail is failing to honour an agreement reached last year to raise pay and reform pensions. The deal also included plans to reduce the working week and improve job security.Terry\u0026nbspPullinger, deputy general secretary of the\u0026nbspCWU,​\u0026nbspaccused Royal Mail bosses of breaking a progressive agreement\u0026nbspfor a successful postal service with “social aims”.\u0026nbspHe added: “Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British Postal service in the interest of fast track profit and greed.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

It’s at the movies.”To emphasise his point, he\u0026nbsphighlighted the word “cinema” in Marvel Cinematic Universe.Scorsese sparked controversy after comparing Marvel films to theme park rides.\u0026nbspIn an interview with Empire Magazine published last month, Scorsese said that he had “tried” to watch movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that they are “not cinema”.“Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks,” he said. “It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

When the opportunity arises I would buy new trains on more favourable terms, but we will inherit a leasing arrangement that will be sustained for some time to come, and I have never said anything other than that.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The cost of purchasing rolling stock is a fraction of the £196 billion and was included as that is what full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry would likely involve. If a Labour government chose not to purchase the rolling stock, they would still need to pay the cost of leasing them.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unless you live under a rock, you will have been as gripped as the rest of us by Coleen’s very public suggestion that Rebekah has sold stories about Coleen’s personal le “for a few years now”.“After a long time of trying to ­figure out who it could be,” Coleen wrote on Instagram, “for ious reasons I had a ­suspicion. To try and prove this I came up with an idea.”That meant blocking all of her followers except one on her private Instagram account, then posting fake stories to seethey made it into the papers.“The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about ing to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house,” she wrote, were all .So when the stories appeared in print, Coleen pounced. “Now I know for certain which account inidual it’s come from. It’s . . . Rebekah Vardy’s account.”Rebekah denies being the ­source of the stories, claiming a string of other people have had access to her Instagram account. Call me old-fashioned, but why didn’t Coleen pick up the phone instead of picking a public fight Coleen assumed this saga would grab the world’s attention. It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube. But that has nothing to do with weight . . . and everything to do with how off-putting it is to sit next to someone scoffing a stinking kebab.It is pretty straightforward to work outsomeone wants to have sex with you. And more importantly, when they don’t.Both my kids know how to respect others, as well as themselves. They learned it well before they got to uni.If you need to do this course when you start at university, it might already be too late.THE issue of kne crime in the capital was brought closer to home than ever for me when a schoolboy was stabbed at .pm in Stratford, East London.The attack took place in broad daylight, just after school ended, on West Ham’s doorstep.Just like that, another le was snuffed out and a family devastated.We must finally make this a priority before yet more children die needlessly.What will her one-year-old twins Leo and Lenon thinkthey read that in years to come  Maybe they will assume she was joking.Each of my two kids thinks I prefer the other one. At times, I prefer the dog!HUGE congratulations to Natalie Imbruglia, who has welcomed her first baby – a little boy she has called Max Valentine – at the age of  after conceiving with the help of a sperm donor.Good for her. She hasn’t just settled for any old man but wanted to become a mother so has done it herself. Much respect. A baby born to a mother who is single by choice could hardly be more wanted or more loved.Both Natalie and her baby will be happier without the wrong husband or father being on the scene.Meanwhile, Naomi Campbell has said she is “not yet” ready to become a mother at the age of .

I can’t imagine having a baby at , which Naomi would be evenshe went ahead with it right now.The word she used about my eggs was “manky”. Nice.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first is Brexit. The second is the ending of this rotten parliament. Neither can come soon enough.Expect hopeless puppet Jeremy Corbyn and those pulling his strings to try to block both.IT seems that “sorry” is not the hardest word, after all, for Anne Sacoolas.With the news that she no longer has diplomatic immunity over the car crash which killed Brit Harry Dunn, , in August, the US intelligence officer’s we broke her silence yesterday.Mrs Sacoolas’s lawyers said she wanted to meet Harry’s family “to express her deepest sympathy and apologies”.Understandably, Harry’s parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn were less than impressed as they flew to America yesterday in search of justice, and Charlotte said: “As it’s nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn’t cut it.”If the “devastated” Mrs Sacoolas truly does appreciate the pain Harry’s loss has caused, she will hopefully admit she was wrong to flee England,and let police continue their investigations.In the meantime, we hope a meeting with Harry’s parents will help them on the way towards some sort of closure.It’s the very least they deserve.IT will be another momentous week in British politics this week and yet it has all gone quiet on Brexit.Could it be that EU officials are too busy with their UK counterparts, working out the details of a deal its negotiators and their collaborators in our parliament said could not be done Let us hope that silence is golden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You failed to turn around the business.You couldn’t hide these numbers forever, they caught up with you. Isn’t that the truth Mr Meysman tried to argue the firm was still going well in many areas, but was slapped down by Ms Reeves.She raged: You are here today because , people have lost their jobs, , people were on their holiday and had to be brought home...You have brought down a  year business with huge repercussions for customers, staff and taxpayers.Ill point to the failures, and they hugely outweigh the successes you have spoken about.You and your colleagues offered some apologies... I think you are deluded about the business, Mr Meysman, you ran.When you are pointing to the successes, you might want to have a little bit more humility, Mr Mesyman.Top MP Frank Field today demanded they hand their money back to the firm.He said: If they’ve had a chance to check how their own pensions are affected, perhaps the high-paid executives responsible would like to bolster the retirement of some of the workers they left behind, and give some of it back Mr Fankhauser said he inherited a huge debt pile when he came into the role, but had paid back millions in interest and refinancing cost.The firm had multiple profit warnings before he even arrived, he said today.Yesterday the Government outlined plans to allow failed airlines to repatriate passengers so Brits wont be left stranded in future.A number of airlines have gone bust in recent years, with the collapse of Monarch Airlines in  leaving thousands stranded abroad.We explain how to protect yourselfyour airline or holiday provider goes under."},{"url":null,"title":"woman gallbladder stomach liquid nitrogen drink","story":"Stacey Wagers, , says she felt an “explosion” in her chest when she sipped the water served by a waiter at the Don CeSar Hotel in St Pete Beach, Florida.She has now filed a lawsuit against the company after the November  incident left her insides badly burned and with lelong digestive issues.Stacey had been celebrating a friend’s birthday but was later rushed to hospital where she had her gallbladder and part of her stomach cut from her body.The waiter had put the liquid nitrogen – which can reach temperatures as low as -F - into the glass to give it a smokey effect, Stacey’s lawsuit says.After taking one sip, the -year-old said she felt “like I was dying” when the nitrogen burned through her organs.She told NBC: “There was an explosion in my chest that occurred within seconds of drinking the water.“I couldn’t speak.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My body was being pushed forwards and into the barrier.It started to bounce and thats when remember it tilting – I was worried about coming out but thats the last thing I remember thinking.I remember the sensation of falling out, but I dont remember what I was thinking. There wasn’t a period where I thought the barrier was coming loose, it just happened all at once.I just remember seeing silver, asit was the floor, I would have said I fell out and dropped straight to the ground below, I didnt know I had been flown through the air like a ragdoll until my mum told me in hospital.“People thought I was dead.”Jade says she woke up, surrounded by strangers and at first she thought she was in a dream.People have said I looked like I was dead, with my eyes open. I thought it was a dream, I gave it a minute and then realised it wasnt a dream and thats when I started to panic and people were telling me not to move.I thought Id lost all of my teeth, my mouth felt like it had been scrambled.Jade said she does not normally go on bigger rides, but her friend had persuaded her to go on it shortly after they arrived on the evening of Monday, October .The ride is believed to be the same one which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia five years ago.She added: The barrier must have come free, and when that happened my le was left relying on the clasp and buckle of an old seat belt. How can that be right Police have been investigating the accident that happened on the Airmaxx .Jade said: I feel lucky to be alive, or to have come away from this without a brain or spinal injury which would have left me paralysed for le, so I do feel lucky in a way.Jade, who had recently left her job as a barmaid, now fears she might lose the new job she was due to start this week in a call centre.She said: My face is still really swollen, I cant smile, it worries me that my mouth will never feel the same again, I also have a big gash on my chin which was sewn up in surgery.She is now being supported by her solicitor at Hudgell Solicitors, but said her main aim is to find out exactly what happened and for any safety improvements that need to be made, to be made - not just compensation.She said: If I could have that ride scrapped and put out of business, never to be used again but I didnt get any compensation then at least Ive achieved something and saved someone from losing a le or losing their child or going through what Ive gone through.If the ride came back next year I would be very very angry.Hull Fair bosses say thrill seekers have more chance of being struck by lightning in Sainsburys than being thrown off a ride.Garry Leach, who is chairman of the Showmen’s Guild, says ride operators are devastated by what happened on the Airmaxx  and that they were doing all they could to assist the Health and Safety Executive, which is leading the investigation.The girl that fell off the ride has a broken jaw and ribs, which is not good and we hope that she will have a swt recovery.Mr Leach said he could not confirm the ride is the actual ride which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia, but did say it was exactly the same type as the one that operated in Australia.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When the son was asked for ID, his father told the manager that his son didn’t need ID for the drink.“The gentleman grabbed the drink and handed it to his son, telling him to drink it as they were leaving the pub.“The manager reached out and tried to grab the drink, but the man moved his arm away and dropped the drink onto the floor, shouting there had been an assault and that he would be reporting the manager to the police.“Wetherspoon stands  per cent with the pub’s manager and the company is more than happy to hand over CCTV to the police to show the entire incident on film.When informed of JD Wetherspoons decision to bar him from the pub, Ian said he wasnt aware.He added that he couldnt care less and that he has other places to go to drink.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Former Tory Dominic Grieve, Plaid Cymru leader Liz Saville Roberts, Labour ’s David Lammy , Green MP Caroline Lucas and SNP MP Peter Grant have travelled to Brussels to make the case for an extension so the UK can hold a referendum on any deal.They will hold meetings with key French, Dutch and Irish representatives ahead of the European Council on Thursday. Mr Grieve, who had the Tory whip removed for voting to stop no deal, told the Mirror: The suggestion that we can magically have a deal presented to parliament to approval on Saturday so we can leave on st is not only a fantasy but itaposs very dangerous becausethereaposs an attempt to do that itaposs really short-circuiting the normal processes the House of Commons. And Parliament may wish to attach a confirmatory referendum to any deal that is negotiated because the deal bears no resemblance to what was being promoted in the  referendum at all. As the time ticks down to the st October the MPs say there is growing moves within parliament for MPs to back a deal with a referendum attached.Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that the UK will leave at the end of October do or die despite the Benn Act which orders Mr Johnson to request a three-month extension on October thereaposs no Brexit deal by that point. Pressure to sign off on a draft agreement is peaking. A legal text needs to be published ahead of the summitthe EU are to consider ratying the Withdrawal Agreement at the two-day summit. Their approval would allow Mr Johnson to put the deal to MPs in a proposed extraordinary sitting of Parliament on Saturday. This would give him a chance to avoid a monumental clash over asking for a Brexit extension - something he has repeatedly ruled out doing but is compelled to do so under the Benn Act.That legislation passed by MPs opposed to a no-deal, including Tory rebels, orders the PM to ask Brussels for an Article  extension until the end of JanuaryParliament does not back a deal.But there are fears Mr Johnson will find a loophole to avoid making the request as part of his do or die commitment to leave the bloc by the October  deadline. If a Saturday showdown in Parliament is to take place the Government must put a motion before the Commons on Wednesday, to be voted upon on Thursday. During the weekend session, MPs would be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or discuss what to do next in the Brexit saga.The Liberal Democrats have put forward an amendment to the Queenaposs Speech for Tuesday to test whether there is support for a second referendum.And leader Jo Swinson has suggested her Remain-backing party could support a Johnson dealit is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote. Mr Grieve, who says he would vote for a deal with a public vote attached, said: The purpose of going over is to try to make the message clear to the parter countries and the negotiators that the Benn Act matters and that there should be space providedthere is going to be a negotiated deal for parliament to consider it properly within a time frame we can do it which is not a week - this is a major piece of constitutional legislation. So itaposs to say aposplease respect the request made by Parliament by majority to ensure that there is an extension sufficient for us either to take stepsthere is no deal to decide what to do next orthere is a negotiated deal time to discuss it and decide whether parliament wishes to approve it and whether parliament wants to attach a referendum. The delegation organised by anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain have back-to-back meetings with the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to the EU, the Deputy Permanent Representative of France to the EU and the EU Parliamentaposs Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt.    David Lammy said: I expect the EU will want to hear from parliamentarians what the prospect of any deal getting through parliament are. I think there is a realistic chance of getting a deal throughthere is a referendum attached. The Labour MP is considering voting for the dealthere is a referendum was attached - and believes the majority of his colleagues could be persuaded to join him. This is a shocking deal. Boris Johnson has been prepared to reduce standards, to deregulate further and this is a deal that keeps us out of the customs union and out of the single market so this is a shocking hard Brexit deal. There is nothing in it thataposs better for my constituents, nothing thataposs consistent with Labour values.    Having said that in a spirit of compromise my position has always been the Kyle Wilson position that it is ultimately for the Britsh people whether they prefer this deal to remaining in the European Union. I am clear I will fight tooth and nail to remain with the European Union. But of course the Labour family would be prepared to support a deal attached to a confirmatory referendum. The cross-party group, just a small number of a much larger move in parliament to reach out beyond party lines, will try and show the EU, for whom coalitions are a much normal party of politics, how signicant their cooperation is. Plaid Cymruaposs Westminster Leader Liz Saville Roberts I think itaposs important that there isnapost just one voice in this we are doing something quite extraordinary in Westminster parliamentary terms because weaposve got is effectively a cross-party group and the other surprising thing and what youaposre seeing is that we can all work together. Former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: Iaposm attracted by the cross-party working, something I encouraged as party leader. I think itaposs been a key factor in stopping us crashing out it led to the Benn Act. Itaposs important that we act as a counterbalance to Boris Johnson by coming here and making the case for an extension, not just for its own sake, but for a referendum. Green MP Caroline Lucas agreed saying: I think the importance of the cross-party nature is just to reassure European politicians and leaders that there is support in the Westminster parliament for a meaningful extension that is long enough to have a democratic event which in my view should be a confirmatory referendum on the deal and that we believe the Benn Act is robust.

Hardline Brexiteers revealed a ide - which could scupper any hope of passing a deal in Parliament this Saturday - after being invited in for crucial talks in  Downing Street. Tory MPs and Boris Johnsonaposs DUP allies were briefed as Brussels talks go down to the wire  ahead of an EU summit tomorrow. But while many showed support for an emerging deal, prominent Tory Owen Paterson blasted the reported plan as absurd and unacceptable.Mr Paterson hit out at reports that the EU is considering a customs border down the Irish Sea - contrary to what Boris Johnson suggested two weeks ago.He told The Sun: Concerns remain that the EU will seek to trap Northern Ireland permanently in the EU Customs Union by trying to reheat the failed ideas of customs partnerships or single customs territories that proved so disastrous for Theresa May .He added: “When would any other country ever give up part of its territory as part of trade talks  It would be particularly absurd for Northern Ireland. “It would shatter the Belfast Agreement’s Principle of Consent and completely undermine Northern Ireland’s status as an integral part of the UK. We must not go down this route. Mr Paterson spoke out despite other hardline Brexiteers offering Mr Johnson support. Self-styledBrexit hardman Steve Baker later said he was optimistic that Mr Johnsonaposs team would finalise a tolerable deal that I will be able to vote for. And Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Commons leader who sits in the Cabinet, told LBC I think the votes are there now for a deal in Parliament.But the DUP were lukewarm despite a -minute meeting between their leader Arlene Foster and the PM last night. Gaps remain and further work is required, a spokesman said after Ms Foster slipped out the back gate of No to avoid the press. Today Iain Duncan Smith, a former Cabinet minister, denied he exploded at No officials over the planned deal saying I wasnapost exploding anywhere. Mr Duncan Smith added he and other Tories were not shown details of the deal. Boris Johnson sent the EU a new Brexit plan in October  to replace Theresa Mayaposs -page Withdrawal Agreement. It would keep a transition period continuing EU rules and payments to December . But it would scrap the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic from . In the backstopaposs place would be apostwo bordersapos:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.Customs checks across the Irish border would only take place on a very small number of goods, away from the border itself to avoid new physical infrastructure. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland would get a chance to exit EU single market rules every four years through a vote in Stormont. But this proposal was reportedly dropped after anger in the EU. Stormont has not sat for years and there are fears such a veto would give the DUP too much power."},{"url":null,"title":"adorable school photo harry 8","story":"NewsAdorable school photo of Harry, , hides heartbreaking fight against rare illnessHarry Addy is battling a rare form of brain cancer and his mum, Melanie, is appealing for help in beating the diseaseShareCommentsByJane LavenderAssistant Editor:,  OCT NewsHarry beaming on his first day back at school \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Little Harry has been battling a pilocytic astrocytoma, which is a spinal cord tumour, since December . He also has leptomeningeal disease in his brain - a rare complication of his cancer where the disease has spread to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The schoolboy is currently undergoing gruelling weekly chemotherapy at Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge.  But his determined mum wants to raise £, for proton beam therapy, a pioneering radiotherapy treatment that pinpoints tumours with better accuracy and is said to reduce damage to other organs. Harry, who loves wrestling, and his family are still waiting to hearthe NHS will approve him for treatment in the UK, so Melanie wants to raise enough to ensure he can have it abroad. Melanie said: Harry is still smiling. He’s just a happy boy who wants to get on with le. He’s endured weekly chemo for almost two and a half years. With an adult, someone might end up feeling sorry for themselves. But with Harry, it’s completely dferent. He’s just the most amazing child you could possibly imagine.    He’ll never be able to run around like other kids but he’s ed to school and he loves watching WWE Wrestling. We sit and watch Monday Night Raw together - it’s awesome. And we just have to keep fighting, together, as a family. Melanie - also mum to Daisy, , Matilda, six, and three-year-old Hattie - explains that Harry has already had to major operations to remove the tumour. Each time he has had to learn how to walk again but still the growth hasnapost been totally removed. Harry began his first year of chemotherapy in February , a treatment which ultimately failed to bring the tumour under control.    Meanwhile a subsequent - and successful -  month-long stint of weekly chemotherapy is due to end soon. Melanie, a former marketing worker from Stalham, Norfolk, has been documenting her son’s progress through the Facebook page ‘Harry’s Journey’. Underneath the photo of Harry ing to school this month, she wrote: So proud of Harry today. He’s gone off to school for the first time since May - with a big smile on his face! Fingers crossed it all goes well for him today! I’m picking him up at  for his weekly chemo!    After today it will be four left. We are very excited about this - although also very anxious for the next part of Harry’s Journey xxxxx’. Harry had to have shunts fitted into his brain in June to remove the excess fluid that was building there. Melanie says that procedure took Harry and her family to their lowest ebb yet. In one agonising Facebook post, Melanie revealed: Harry woke up crying, wanting to go home, saying he hates his le, and asking why do bad things always happen to me  Our hearts are completely breaking. I have watched him go through so much, and it doesn’t get any easier.    In July she added: Today has been a tough day!! It’s heartbreaking to watch - he’s been through so much, and continues to go through so much on a daily basis! Now, as Harry prepares to ring a bell at Addenbrooke’s signalling the end of this round of chemo, Melanie faces an anxious wait to discover what happens next. Harry is due a new MRI scan in October which will determine the next treatment. The youngster has already been denied by the NHS’ proton therapy commissioning  that decides which patients receives the treatment. They argued that proton therapy was not appropriate for Harry at this time owing to the complications in his brain.    And while Melanie accepts that decision, she feels Harry will fit the clinical criteria for proton therapy in the future - but fears that because he’s been rejected once, he’ll be rejected again. She’s instead hoping to pay for proton therapy privately at a treatment centre abroad and has already managed to raise £, of a £, target. Melanie said: Harry’s diagnosis is extremely rare - Addenbrooke’s oncologists say they’ve never seen what Harry has in his brain before - and we have to take every day at a time. I feel the tumour in Harry’s spine would be best treated with protons. He’ll definitely need proton therapy in the future. But because we’ve already been rejected by the NHS, I worry we’ll never get it.    Which is why we’re attempting to crowdfund for future treatment. Just the other day, someone anonymously donated £,. I have no idea who did it, but it’s amazing. People are amazing. AndHarry does eventually get accepted for proton therapy on the NHS, every penny we’ve raised will be donated to the charities who’ve helped us so far. The first ever NHS proton therapy centre opened at the Christie Hospital in Manchester last year while a second NHS facility is due to launch at the University College Hospital, London, next year - at a combined cost of £million. But they will only be able to treat around  patients each year - the vast majority being children.    And European proton beam therapy expert Dr Jiri Kubes, medical director of the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, Czech Republic, says the treatment can be highly beneficial when it comes to treating paediatric cancers. He added: Unlike standard photon radiation, protons release only a small amount of energy as they pass through the healthy tissues. Just before the end of the proton’s trajectory, the tissue absorbs most of the energy, and there is a sharp increase in the dose to the tumour, followed by a subsequent sharp decrease beyond the tumour. And by sparing the healthy tissue we can improve the quality of le of pediatric patients after treatment, particularly when it comes to secondary tumours. It will also be the case, however, that many UK patients who want proton therapy are not given access to it through the NHS.    While the NHS acknowledges the benefits of Proton Beam Therapy, and is building its own centres, they will still only be able to treat a fraction of those who might benefit from it, while many people will be turned down for the treatment because of the very limited indication criteria. There’s still a long way to go before patients in the UK have widespread access to it.

South Wales Police Superintendent Ceri Hughes said her family have been left devastated by her disappearance, reports Wales Online . Brookeaposs family are devastated, are extremely distressed. Her disappearance and to have no contact with her family for this period of time are completely out of character and as the days go on their concerns, and of course ours, are increasing. @We are desperate to of any information that can lead to finding her, she said.    Police believe Ms Morris did not enter her home in Trelewis , on Saturday after she was dropped off by friends in the early hours of the morning. Using CCTV and descriptions from witnesses, they now believe Ms Morris, who plays for Nelson RFC, was last seen heading towards a bridge that leads to Treharris. Superintendent Hughes said: We know Brooke was dropped near to her home address by friends which is in Bontnewydd Terrace in Trelewis. We donapost believe Brooke went inside her home. We believe Brooke instead went down a lane which leads to a bridge that goes over the river and towards Treharris. On Tuesday more than  volunteers gathered to continue the search for Ms Morris and focused around the waterways and undergrowth near to her home.    The superintendent said a number of Ms Morrisapos friends have been helping with inquiries, including those that drove her home. It is not believed that anyone  is involved in her disappearance. Superintendent Hughes said: We have no specic information at this time to suggest anyone  was involved in Brookeaposs disappearance, however, because we donapost know whataposs happened to her itaposs important we keep an open mind. She added: At this time we are keeping an open mind as to where Brooke might be and what has happened, but because of the last sighting of her at that time and the proximity of the river to her home address, we have undertaken searches of the entire area including some dense undergrowth and the river area. On Sunday, both Western and Central Brecon Mountain Rescue teams said they were called to help police search high priority areas in Treharris.    Superintendent Hughes said: There are a number of challenges with the terrain with dense undergrowth and some fast flowing waterways in that area together with railway tracks. Whilst we are extra grateful to the local community for the help they have given, and of course want to be involved in the search effort, it is really import we continue to work together to make sure people are safe. In a statement shared online, Treharris councillor Sherelle Jago thanked the community for their effort in the search, which is being co-ordinated from Treharris Phoenix RFC.

However doctors fear the decline in families opting to get their kids the childhood jab MMR that wards off measles, mumps and rubella could lead to increased death rates among youngsters.    The doctor prescribed ibuprofen and paracetamol, Miss Bower said. Within a few seconds of taking it, Molly drted off to sleep. We later tried to wake her for a shower, we couldn’t get her to walk, it was like carrying a dead weight. I left the room for five minutes afterwards to get her more clothes and the next thing I knew I heard screaming [from a family friend].

Jason Farrell, , allegedly attacked -year-old Sammy-Lee Lodwig at his flat and then confessed that he had sliced her up, but he denied charges of murder, wounding with intent and unlawful wounding, the court heard. Swansea Crown Court heard that the defendant used to date his victimaposs mother and in the days before the attack had been heard expressing a desire to hurt and kill Sammy-Lee, her mother Sarah and Christopher Maher, the man he suspected of being in a relationship with Ms Lodwig senior. Prosecutor Michael Jones told the jury: He was, in short, jealous. Mr Jones read from a chilling letter written by Farrell after his arrest in which he wrote: We went back to my flat and we started arguing.  Then the next thing I had her tied up and told her Iaposd had enough and I was going to kill her. I did by repeatedly stabbing her in the face and throat. Farrell, who denies murder, started a relationship with his victim after she became a regular visitor to his flat for drugs, the court was told. Mr Jones said Farrell knocked at a neighbouraposs window on April , saying: I killed her. A friend of the neighbour went with six-foot-tall Farrell to his flat in Carlton Terrace in the Mount Pleasant area of Swansea.  There, he saw the body of Ms Lodwig, who was ft ins and weighed six stone, on a bed. Farrell fled after the emergency services were alerted and paramedics found his girlfriend fully-clothed, with cuts across her throat and forehead and severe bleeding on the bedding. It was estimated that Ms Lodwig died  or  minutes before they arrived. A black-handled kitchen kne covered in blood, with the tip of its cm blade missing, was found next to the bed.  Forensic scientist Claire Morse said it appeared the woman had been assaulted while on the bed. Mr Jones also said knotted and blood-stained dressing gown belts with traces of Ms Lodwigaposs saliva were found nearby, suggesting they may have been in or around her mouth.

Boohoo has been censured in a separate ruling over a socially irresponsible marketing email asking customers to send nudes. The since-banned Missguided advert - shown on ITV Hub during Love Island on June  - opened with a close-up of a womanaposs mouth as she held a strawberry between her lips.    It then showed young women in swimwear on a boat, before on-screen text stated: If you plan on wearing clothes this summer... weaposve got you covered... kind of. The ad showed young women on a beach with their legs apart in seductive poses, a woman running her hand up her inner thigh, a group of women in thong bikinis and another woman posing in a bikini with her legs astride on a motorcycle. On-screen text at the end of the ad stated “SCORE % OFF WITH CODE BABE”.    A viewer complained that the ad overly sexualised and objectied women. Missguided said the ad was aimed at those under  years of age and tried to promote a particular lestyle rather than just clothing. It said the ad was shown on video-on-demand around Love Island and was not dissimilar from the opening titles and content of the programme itself. ITV said the ad depicted similar values, swimwear and scenes as Love Island and that it was surprised to learn that a viewer of the programme had considered the content of the ad offensive.Related video: But the ASA ruled that it breached the advertising code for being overly sexualised and presenting the models as sexual objects. The ASA said: We considered that the cumulative effect of the scenes meant that overall, the products had been presented in an overly sexualised way that invited viewers to view the women as sexual objects. It added that some viewers who enjoyed watching Love Island would nevertheless be seriously offended by advertising that presented women as sexual objects. Because the ad objectied women, we concluded that it was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence.

Molly-Rose Taylor, , said doctors had previously dismissed her complaints as aposperiod painsapos - and it was left up to her to secure a diagnosis. The nanny suffered agonising period pains from the age of nine-years-old which caused her to become delirious and frequently faint. She was misdiagnosed four times and says multiple doctors failed to spot the cm thick wall of tissue running vertically down her vagina known as the longitudinal septum - which caused her to have two.    After five long years, Molly-Rose began to thoroughly research online and discovered her condition, she is sharing her story for the first time to raise awareness of uterus didelphys. Molly-Rose from Gillingham, Kent, said: When I first started my periods, doctors would blame my age and say my body is still young and canapost cope. But now I know it is because I am having two periods at once, I have been on birth control since  years-old to try and reduce the heavy flow and fainting. As I got into my early teens, I attempted to use tampons, but it would fall straight out, I thought maybe it was normal. It wasnapost until I became sexually active with my then boyfriend, I began to worry as it was impossible and very painful. I noticed there was a piece of skin in the middle and two holes and I felt so embarrassed. From the outside, you would never even know, even the doctors didnapost as I had attended three appointments.    Before my diagnosis I was advised to get tested for a sexually transmitted disease due to the bleeding and abnormal discharge. It came back all clear, as predicted - I knew something was wrong and began to research myself which was a challenge itself. Molly-Rose says there was a lack of knowledge and awareness in the medical practise and she had to tirelessly research online before finding uterus didelphys. She adds: There wasnapost any leaflets for me to read nor doctors who could help me understand my condition which is why it took so long for me to get a diagnosis.    I told my GP that I know what it is and was referred to a gynaecologist and I requested general anaesthetic for the intrusive vaginal scan. I went on to have general anaesthetic for my second gynaecologist appointment... I was desperate to get some answers. Within ten minutes, they confirmed I have two uteruses, two cervixes and two vaginas - I felt so happy to finally know what is wrong.

She gave birth normally and he was born breathing - so the pair savoured every second by having cuddles, taking pictures and getting his hand and footprints taken.

It meant that I had no fluidand Freddie-Philipaposs kidneys were covered in cysts. They gave me lots of options, which I refused. We knew he wouldn’t survive but at the end of the day he was still my baby and I was growing him. I wanted to see his face and give him a cuddle. He was ours.    He was born breathing, so we had four hours of unexpected precious time with him. I gave birth on the normal labour ward and we took tonnes of pictures, had cuddles with him and the vicar came and gave him a blessing. We still talk to her to this day. The nurses were amazing and gave us two teddies and a keepsake memory box with his handprints and footprints in. It was really special. Cassie and her family were supported by staff at the Snowdrop Suite, a special unit for bereaved parents at Burtonaposs Queenaposs Hospital. Cassie said: My mum and partner were there with me the whole way through and I can’t remember that much because it was all a blur.

Fiorenzo Sauro, , had  protected trees illegally felled to build  homes. The redwood, in Penllergaer, Swansea, South Wales, was one of the first in Britain, planted in . Swansea council tree officer Alan Webster told a court the tree was “irreplaceable”. He added: “This is ancient woodland dating back hundreds of years. It is important.’ Sauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were yesterday found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order by magistrates in Swansea, south Wales. The tree contractor who carried out the illegal felling was fined another £, for the destruction in the ancient woodlands. A court heard the towering ft tree was estimated to be worth more than £, but, in reality, it was “irreplaceable”. Sauro said the felling was an accident - but a judge ruled he “deliberately” ordered it to be chopped down to make way for  new homes.    Sauro and his company, Enzo Homes Ltd, were ordered to stump up a fine totalling £, by a district judge in Swansea, South Wales. Enzo Homes were fined £, while Sauro was fined £,. Annabel Graham-Paul, prosecuting, said: “This was an intentional breach or flagrant disregard for the law. “The trees felled are irreplaceable natural resources. The soils in the ancient woodland can never be replicated. “Swansea Council aim to replace the trees within two years but the ancient woodlands are irreplaceable and the redwood is going to take a long time to grow back to its former glory so it is by no means going to be a like for like replacement.” Swansea Magistrate’s Court heard Sauro made “no financial gain” from felling the trees and is involved with the council’s plans to replant what was cut down.    Alex Goodman, representing Sauro said: “Sauro has sourced replacement trees at his own expense which are being carefully nurtured in a nursery. “This reflects Sauro’s remorse and regret for what happened.” District judge Neale Thomas said: “I find it dficult to equate the harm to a monetary value. The harm is much greater. “It is inconceivable on this evidence the felling of this tree and the ancient woodland was done in any other way than deliberately. “There would have been discussions about how it was to be done, permission obtained to remove the fence and any other preparatory work.”  “Mr Sauro caused the destruction of these trees in the most obvious way: namely by directing they should be felled. “This is a deliberate planned breach of the tree preservation order and in defiance of it”. Sauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order. Both the company and its director were also ordered to contribute a total of £, towards the prosecution costs. A court heard the firm were developing  houses at the site in Penllergaer Estate, Swansea, when the trees were chopped.

Jill Sharpaposs celebrations have angered her victims, who say the -year-old has shown a total lack of remorse while flaunting her freedom in Facebook posts. One snap shows Rangers fan Sharp, of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, grinning widely on a sofa with her partner Craig Hale while they are dressed in matching pyjamas. Their hands are clasped as they clutch glasses of Moët  Chandon champagne are surrounded by balloons reading Welcome home and #Done, the Daily Record reports. An undated photo posted after her early release shows her smiling in a hot tub while raising a glass of Veuve Clicquot on a previous holiday.    A friend commented: You will be back there before you know it. Sharp replied with a plane emoji, writing: You know me only too well lol... The countdown is on! Sharp was released from jail after serving just three months of her one-year term for stalking two former friends, creating fake social media profiles while tormenting them. When she was sentenced at Livingston Sherf Court in July, she wept in the dock and a judge blasted her for her disgraceful and wicked” terror campaign against Maggie Paton, , and her husband Steve. Sharp sent emails to the couple’s workplaces with  claims they were involved in criminal activity, including dealing drugs to kids.  Mr Paton, , hit out at Sharp following her release, telling the Daily Record: “There is a total lack of remorse for what she put us through. This obsession she has with champagne is sad but we won’t be intimidated by her. “It seems ridiculous that Sharp was sentenced to  months but only served three and is out before Christmas. “But the whole world now knows what she did after she admitted it in court. She is the type to just keep squirming and denying everything but even her friends and family know she is an obsessive stalker and fantasist.  “She may have got out of jail early but her reputation has been destroyed forever by what she did to us. She is a laughing stock at Ibrox and you would have to be off your head to believe she is innocent after all the details emerged in court.” After her release from jail Sharp reactivated her Facebook account and posted the snaps of her and Hale celebrating with champagne. The couple both still live with their parents. In one photo, they are seen wearing matching Rangers pyjamas. But fans have made it clear they are not welcome at old haunts such as the well-known Rangers pub the Louden Tavern.  One wrote on Twitter : “All joking aside, disgraceful those two maniacs still think it’s acceptable to post the stuff they do. “Welcome Home balloons, the lot, knowing the fact it’ll get a reaction and she will be bold enough to flaunt herself in the Louden the next home game.” In the comments under Sharpaposs Facebook photos, her friends wrote welcome back and one even joked where did u disappear to, which Sharp responded to with a laughing emoji. One friend wrote: Good to see you with the rangers top back on. Sharp replied: Thank you very much! It sure feels good lol!

The -year-old woman says she is lucky to be alive after being flung through the air like a ragdoll. Jade Harrison was flung around  to  feet from the Airmaxx , hitting a teenage boy who was on the neighbouring Sizzler attraction. She wants to see the ride, which she says could have killed her, scrapped for good.Jade is still unable to smile - nine days after the accident - due to her facial injuries. She also lost a tooth and is likely to lose two more and faces weeks on liquid food, reports Hull Live .   The former waitress faces several weeks in recovery after the incident after having to undergo a two-hour operation on her broken jaw, with metal plates fitted to hold her face together. Jade - who is too upset and embarrassed to show her face in new photographs - has instructed personal injury expert Hudgell Solicitors. The law firm is now calling for a full and transparent investigation to provide Jade with answers. Re-living the ordeal, Jade said she just remembers waking up, laid on her back, with a mouth full of blood. She said: I remember the process of getting on the ride, the ride started, and as it started, the barrier clicked a bit, I said to my friend aposDid yours just click apos and he said aposyesapos, so I thought that was fine.    We must have been half way through the ride, it was bouncing a lot, spinning us around, it was OK, but then the actual carriage position of it changed, so all our weight was facing forwards onto the bar. My body was being pushed forwards and into the barrier. It started to bounce and thataposs when remember it tilting – I was worried about coming out but thataposs the last thing I remember thinking. I remember the sensation of falling out, but I donapost remember what I was thinking. There wasnapost a period where I thought the barrier was coming loose, it just happened all at once. I just remember seeing silver, asit was the floor, I would have said I fell out and dropped straight to the ground below, I didnapost know I had been flown through the air like a ragdoll until my mum told me in hospital.    Jade says she woke up, surrounded by strangers and at first she thought she was in a dream. I just remember being laid there and looking in the sky, and I could see the Star Flyer ride. People have said I looked like I was dead, with my eyes open. I thought it was a dream, I gave it a minute and then realised it wasnapost a dream and thataposs when I started to panic and people were telling me not to move. I thought Iaposd lost all of my teeth, my mouth felt like it had been scrambled. I could see my friend, I could hear people saying aposhow old is sheapos and asking him questions about me – I was trying to speak but because of what had happened, my mouth was full of blood. Jade said she does not normally go on bigger rides, but her friend had persuaded her to go on it shortly after they arrived on the evening of Monday, October .    The ride is believed to be the same one which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia five years ago. Due to her nerves about rides, she immediately pulled down her own safety barrier. She said the attendant then came and took her £ ride fare and fastened the seatbelt. She said: “I pulled the safety bar down myself as soon as I got on as I get paranoid that rides are going to set off without my barrier being down. \u2028Jade says she is not an angry sort of person but has been left angry about what happened to her. She said: The barrier must have come free, and when that happened my le was left relying on the clasp and buckle of an old seat belt. How can that be right  Police and the Health and Safety Executive have been investigating the incident. Jade said: \u2028“I feel angry as nobody should go to a fair and be thrown from a ride. It is disgusting really and when I think about how it happened it makes me angry that the that the safety systems simply didn’t do their job. She has since been told the ride was not stopped after her fall, and instead continued until its session finished. Jade has tried not to think too much about what could have happened. She said: I feel lucky to be alive, or to have come away from this without a brain or spinal injury which would have left me paralysed for le, so I do feel lucky in a way. I’ve tried not to think too much about what could have happened to me. What I have thought about a lot is how really small children are allowed to go on these fast rides at the fair, and how dangerous they are.

Patients must be able to attend cancer screenings during evenings and weekends, and in locations close to their home or work, the Government-ordered review said. Professor Sir Mike Richards said women need to be given more choice over where they go for tests, including for cervical or breast cancer. The former national cancer tsar believes the changes could halt the worrying decline in the number of people attending screenings.    His study looked in detail at the NHS screening programmes for abdominal aortic aneurysm, bowel cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer and diabetic eye screening. It said outdated IT systems used for screening must be overhauled as they are currently too fragmented and lead to errors, risking patient safety. Furthermore, delays in introducing new types of screening - such as a delay of over a decade in bringing in the new bowel cancer test - end up costing lives. The study found people would be more likely to accept invitations for screeningappointments were available either near their home or workplace - at convenient times. Some women also prefer to be screened at sexual health clinics, it said.    The document noted GPs must be incentivised to provide convenient appointments and ensure people take up screening. Text message reminders could also be sent to increase uptake of appointments, although current IT systems hinder access to mobile phone numbers. More should also be made of social media campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of screening, the report said. The study also said trans people and gender erse populations are currently poorly served by screening services and this must be improved.    It said: Transmen may have a cervix and thus be at risk of cervical cancer. However, their gender may be recorded as male and thus they would not be routinely called for cervical screening. Transwomen are at an increased risk of breast cancer compared to cisgender menusing hormones, but are only invited for screeningregistered as female. The report welcomed the Governmentaposs new funding to replace MRI machines, CT scanners and breast screening equipment, saying some equipment was hugely outdated. It noted that some mobile vans for breast screening were at least  years old with leaking roofs. And while most patients get the results of their screening on time, just .% of women received their cervical screening results within the recommended two weeks in April  due to a changeover to a new system.    The report said the current screening service saves over , lives a year but there is a sense that we are now slipping and each screening service could do better. It was also unclear who is accountable for the screening service - with Public Health Englandand NHS England both having key roles - and the report said responsibility must be transferred to NHS England. The current system lacks clear leadership and accountability, the report said. The rationale for iding responsibilities across PHE and NHSE is often unclear and creates confusion, delays and risks to patient safety. On IT, the study said the current systems used for screening are woefully out of date and long due for replacement, leading to inefficiencies and errors. It added: Some of the systems - particularly those for breast and cervical screening - are old and liable to fail.

First, he was rejected by his mum and then heartbreaking footage emerged of him being beaten up in his new home at Wuppertal Zoo. People were so horried by the attacks, almost , signed a petition calling for him to be ed to the UK. Several animal welfare groups said Bili had been left badly traumatised by his ordeal after being sent to the zoo in April last year. The young chimp even had his ear bitten off in the repeated attacks.  Zookeepers, who received death threats after footage of the abuse emerged, were adamant the attacks were perfectly natural. Now Bili has bounced back and made some new friends - and even bagged himself two girlfriends. Monkey curator at Wuppertal, Dr Severun Dressen, , said: We are really pleased to see how Bili is developing. He is becoming much more confident. Staff at the zoo were determined that Bili would fit into his new home and split the animals into two groups.  Dr Dressen explained: We now have two separate groups and can now focus more inidually on Biliaposs needs. \u2028The main problem was thought to be a female bonobo called Eja, , who did not like Bili.\u2028 In the bonobos world, woman are the bosses. Eja has two sons Azibo and Ayubu, eight, and they together with their motheraposs support made Biliaposs le hell from the start.\u2028 Bonobo mothers protect their sons even as adults. But because Bili was rejected by his and moved to Germany to be raised by hand, it made le very dficult for him.  Bili has now been separated from Eja, and her two sons now spend some time with the Brit chimp with no issues. And Bili has also formed a close bond with two females Mahdeblu, , and Kichele, , who are BOTH his girlfriends.\u2028 Dr Dressen said: Bili mates with both of them. Sex seems to be really important to Bili. They seem to get on well and Bili is accepted. Bili is also close to Mahdebluaposs daughter, five-year-old Akeena, and is often seen hugging her  Bili even has some male camaraderie as the troopaposs grandfather Mato, , has also accepted him and plays with him in the enclosure.  A zoo spokesman said: Bili looks much more relaxed overall. We could no longer observe any aggression against him lately.\u2028 Wuppertal Zoo director Dr Arne Lawrenz said people have a romanticised image of nature.\u2028 Dr Lawrenz added: This is why there must be zoos, where we can show what nature really looks like.\u2028 That is our mission and thataposs why we, as zoos, might be at a crossroads here. For example, in the US there is a tendency to not exhibit bonobos because they are politically incorrect in terms of their sexual behaviour and aggression.\u2028 I believe that zoos need to show people that nature is not all about peace, love and harmony, and that itaposs also about rivalry and that the animals are subject to dferent laws to humans.\u2028 Biliaposs mum, Maringa, failed to care for him when he was born in Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire, in October, .

A multinational task force is trying to track down Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China who is suspected of leading a vast drug network that accumulates up to billion a year. The syndicate provides tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries in the Asia-Pacic region, from Japan to New Zealand, authorities believe. Meth, a powerful drug that can create very strong psychological and physical dependence, is believed to be the networkaposs main business. Tse, who is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, flies by private jet and once lost million in a single night at a Macau casino, police say. His narcotics empire was allegedly born out of an alliance of five of Asiaaposs triad groups. Police have dubbed the network Sam Gor, Cantonese for Brother Number Three, which recalls one of Tseaposs nicknames, but its members simply call it The Company. In , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  estimated the syndicateaposs revenue at billion a year, but says it could be as high as . billion.   The agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a  percent to  percent share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years, according to a Reuters investigation .A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart believes Tse is the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate, but police have not publicly identied him as the suspected boss of the trafficking group. Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacic representative for UNODC, said: “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.” Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more erse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australiaaposs biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia, Reuters reports. “The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” one veteran Western anti-drugs official said. “Theylike a global corporation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"google boss says you must","story":"NewsGoogle boss says you must tell visitorsyou have Nest or Alexa in your homeRick Osterloh, during a speech to launch the Google Pixel , said people should be warned that Google Nest and Amazon Echo devises are activeShareCommentsByMartyn Landi:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video what-is-an-alexa-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news google-boss-says-you-must-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDonald Trump went to Istanbul in  for the opening of the Trump Towers complex. The guest of honour was Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s then Prime Minister, now the President. Trump, in between plugging the US version of The Apprentice, heaped praise on Erdogan. He said: “The Prime Minister is very highly respected.” Last week Trump did Erdogan another favour by withdrawing US troops from northern Syria where they were helping Kurdish forces contain the Islamic State threat. The US President effectively gave Erdogan the green light to launch an invasion, he calls it a “peace operation”, aimed at forcing out the Kurds from the region. What happens next could determine the fate of the Middle East and could redraw the battle lines in the power struggle between Russia and the West.    Erdogan is standing over a powder keg with a lit torch. When the EU protested at his military incursion he threatened to send into Europe the . million Syrian refugees Brussels has paid Turkey £.billion to look after. At the UN last month he lectured other nations about the refugees as he held a photo of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey in  after drowning trying to cross the Mediterranean. Nor does he appear to care that the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces are being driven into the arms of Syria’s dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Turkish president has never been afraid of making enemies. Which may be just as well as he is about to make a lot more of them. Born in , the son of a coastguard, he supplemented the family’s meagre income by selling lemonade on Istanbul’s streets. After attending Islamic School he did a degree in business management before taking his first steps into politics. In the s he joined the Islamist National Salvation Party, challenging the secular tradition that had been the hallmark of Turkey since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s presidency in the s.    When Erdogan was banned from taking his seat in parliament in  he successfully stood to be Mayor of Istanbul in . In  he was jailed for four months for reading out an Islamist poem that included the lines “the mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.” Two years later he founded the Justice and Development Partywhich swept to power in  with Erdogan as Prime Minister. His initial years in power saw him reach out to a West that was, in those days, still hoping that Turkey could one day join the EU. Critics of his tendency to accumulate power and silence critics were won over by his economic reforms and technocratic flair. But it became increasingly hard to ignore his authoritarian tendencies. In  he became the country’s first directly-elected president. Then in  he used the aborted military coup to impose a state of emergency that saw him throttle dissent and imprison opponents. He then held a referendum in  to grant himself more powers. Erdogan abolished the post of Prime Minister and gave himself the right to appoint ministers and senior civil servants, issue decrees and oversee all security matters.    The United Nations Human Rights Office said the scale of the repression was “staggering”. In the past three years nearly , people have been arrested , civil servants sacked teachers, judges and lawyers prosecuted on trumped-up charges  journalists arrested , websites blocked and  media outlets shut down. Like Trump he is not adverse to large scale building projects, though his recently completed presidential palace in Ankara makes Trump Towers look like an exhibit from LegoLand. The building cost £million and has more than , rooms, including a laboratory where scientists can check the president’s food has not been poisoned. In the first sign that Erdogan’s grip on power may be fading, his party lost the Istanbul elections in March. After ordering a re-run on the unproven charges of vote rigging he was defeated again with the Republican People’s Party winning by an even bigger margin. The economy has also begun to slow with unemployment reaching % and inflation nudging %. His invasion of northern Syria is seen by some as a classic example of a leader using a military exercise to distract attention from domestic failings. Having won power as a nationalist hard man, Erdogan would have looked weakhe failed to move against Kurds he has long accused of being terrorists. The brutality witnessed on the domestic front has now extended to the foreign. Airstrikes on Kurdish territory by Turkey forces have killed innocent children and caused thousands of civilians to flee the area. Any chance of Turkey joining the EU has evaporated because of Erdogan’s autocratic rule. This has pushed the Turkish leader closer towards Vladimir Putin.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da5853128f723.96970323-424x564.jpg ","title":"dundee winger josh mcpake keen to prove himself at dens during loan spell","story":"Winger Josh McPake is determined to make his name at Dundee during his season-long loan spell at Dens Park.The Rangers youngster joined up with namesake James McPake’s side this summer to gain some much-needed first-team experience.The -year-old has impressed in spells for the Dark Blues this season with his quick feet and direct running.He’s been in and out of the team lately but he’s eager to get more of a taste of first-team football.He said: “I’m really enjoying it at Dundee and playing in the Championship.

The rest, as they say, is history.With a qualying double-header next month against Cyprus and Kazakhstan, Shankland now looks very likely to be involved, fitness permitting.Certainly,he keeps banging in the goals at his current rate for United, he will be hard to resist, not just for Steve Clarke but other potential suitors, too."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47111232-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47111232-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47111232-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47111232-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"university of dundee academic named in bbcs list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world","story":"A University of Dundee academic has been named in the BBC#s list of inspiring and influential women from around the world.Dr Sarah Martins da Silva has been named on the # Women ’ list which asks what the future would look likeit were driven by women.Climate change activist Greta Thunberg and US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are among the other names included in the prestigious list.A senior lecturer in reproductive medicine at the university#s school of medicine, Dr da Silva runs a translational research programme focused around male infertility, sperm biology and drug discovery.She said: “I hope that we can harness science, technology, investment and innovation in male reproductive health to redress global inequalities and the current burden of fertility on women.“I am surprised but delighted to be included on the BBC  Women list.

It’s not like a formal job interview so participants learn how to tackle face-to-face conversations without feeling pressure.“I start by asking them what they want to achieve, and the response can be anything from ‘I want a job in this particular field’ to ‘I want to improve my CV’. Then we see how we can best help. We can either suggest something that can improve their employment prospects or signpost them to someone  who can.”Barnardo’s can enrol people on to schemes such as the Barnardo’s Works Best programme, in which participants earn qualications, gain work experience, try volunteering and add handy skills to their CV, such as first aid.On the day, one of the participants who wants to be a mechanic applied to join the Army.Regimental support worker Phil Carradice said: “It has been really beneficial for us to attend and we feel that we’re able to tell young people about everything the Army officers do in a comfortable setting.“For example,someone is looking to become a mechanic, we can offer training where people are paid more than £, and that rises to £, after it finishes.“Joining the Armed Forces opens up a whole world and people broaden their horizons, and they can move on to pastures new in four years and apply the skills they have learned in a related field.”Callum Boyle was one of those who took part in the workshop.The -year-old, of Kintore, said: “I am really glad I came along, it’s been really interesting to meet people from dferent organisations.“I would like an apprenticeship in admin work so I can work in an office. I’m not sure what I want to do beyond that but today has given me more ideas to think about.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5da0aa4eef9f61.66247159-391x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet jeff theo and gypsy are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This little bundle of energy may look cute, but he will be quite a bit of work for a new owner.Jeff, who is eight months old, is friendly and full of mischief, but has had no training and will need someone to start from scratch with him, including his toilet training.Jeff had been suffering from #cherry eye# but this has now been sorted by vets and hopefully won’t cause further issues.This handsome puss is quite an independent boy.Theo does enjoy cuddles, but only on his terms.The kitty, who is  months old, has been an indoor cat previously but he is really keen to get out, so he’ll need a new owner who is able to give him access to do this.

Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant.

We looked at a wide range of things ndash infrastructure, communities, housing being some examples.ldquoWe realised very quickly that the biggest problem facing the island was housing and it had to be fixed before everything . Therersquos simply just not enough housing for people who are working normal jobs and we are talking about the whole spectrum of things you need for a community ndash from doctors and teachers to care workers and cleaners.At  per cent Arran has one of the highest rates of housing used for holiday or second homes in the UK, second only to St Ives in Cornwall, where one-quarter of properties are holiday homes.The average house price is pound,, while the average wage is only pound,. The AEG estimates that earnings of pound, are required to get on the housing ladder.A study carried out by the group warns that the lack of housing for workers will have serious impacts on the islandrsquos population as time goes on, with  jobs being lost due to lack of affordable accommodation each year with a pound.m loss to the local economy.After  years,things remain as they are, the employment impacts are expected to have risen to  jobs lost and a pound.m shortfall per annum.Ms Borthwick added: ldquoThere are job vacancies right across the island we canrsquot fill because therersquos nowhere for them to stay. What we want to do is build houses that people want to live in. North Ayrshire Council ndash the local authority for Arran ndash is also building new homes on the island to try to alleviate the problem.Councillor Jim Montgomerie, Cabinet Member for Place, said the signicant growth in the short-term lets market was causing particular problems.He added: ldquoWe know that second homes have an inflationary effect on housing markets, and this effect has been magnied on Arran where increasing access to affordable housing is particularly challenging because of land availability, land values, and high construction costs. We are preparing to begin construction of  new council homes on the island and while this new development wonrsquot eliminate the problem, it will be an important step towards addressing the issue."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-dissidents-keep-faith-leader","story":"One thing we can be certain of is that the vote to leave the EU fundamentally changed our expectations and perceptions of politicians. We both revere and vily them as never before.In using legal prowess to cut a path through the arcane procedures of the House of Commons, Dominic Grieve and Joanna Cherry have emerged as unlikely heroes ndash or baddies, depending on your perspective. A recent poll for Sky News showed that only one in seven people trust Parliament on Brexit.That lack of trust cannot be separated from the widespread perception that the public are not being told the full story ndash or even the synopsis ndash from those in power.

Ironically, her greatest political challenges at present come not from the electorate, but from critics within her own party.There is internal stre over her approach to a second independence referendum, tensions which have been exasperated with every juddering lurch of the Brexit crisis. The constant ticking of the countdown clock, as we have edged nearer to each deadline in the Article  process, has ramped up the disgruntlement and impatience within the SNP.As Ms Sturgeon took to the airwaves for a mammoth media round on the second day of SNP conference on Monday, she set out her short and long-term priorities on Brexit and independence.She wants to see Boris Johnson fulfil the obligations placed upon him by the Benn Act to request a three-month extensionParliament hasnrsquot passed his deal ndash or given its support for no-deal ndash by October . It is her hope that the opposition parties will manage to get their act together and that a General Election will follow soon after.She also confirmed that indyref will be ldquofront and centrersquorsquo in the SNPrsquos campaign in the upcoming General Election. With the SNP projected to win the most seats in Scotland, she hopes the momentum is with her party to negotiate over holding another vote.Her strategy relies on Labour forming a minority government with the support of opposition parties. The price of the SNPrsquos support will be for prime minister Jeremy Corbyn to grant a Section  order so a referendum can be held.However, there is a widespread expectation that any such request would be refused, either by an emboldened Mr Johnson ed as prime minister with a majority ndash or a witless Mr Corbyn who refuses to give ground to earn the SNPrsquos support. If that scenario materialises, the undercurrent of party dissent could threaten to burst its banks.:Andy Maciver: Scottish independence is inevitable  Im not so sureA ldquoPlan B to counteract this, supported by SNP councillor Chris McEleny and others, would see a pro-independence majority at the next election being taken as a mandate to enter straight into independence negotiations with the UK government.Ms Sturgeon holds no truck for this muddy proposal, or indeed any deviation from the ldquogold-standardrsquorsquo route to independence that was pursued in . In one interview recently she pointed out that the Westminster voting system makes it possible for the SNP to win the most seats in Scotland, but on a minority of votes. In an age of relentless spin and endless loophole-searching to rig the system, her candour was refreshing.Lets not forget the catalyst for the runaway train of crisis we have seen since  was a leader ndash in David Cameron ndash who bowed to pressure from a minority in his party to seek an answer to a question that, at the time, very few were asking.It is easy to see why the naturally-cautious Ms Sturgeon would want to avoid the legal and constitutional headache that Plan B would bring.She believes that the knee-jerk refusal from Unionist parties to allow a second independence referendum is untenable and that it would be a democratic outrage for Westminster parties of any colour to deny Scotland the right to have a say on its future. While compelling, this argument does rely heavily on the politics of yesteryear: where manesto commitments and election victories meant something, and political reality had an impact on events. In the Brexit Britain of today, it is unlikely that a desire to be ndash or be seen to be ndash fair and reasonable will be enough to compel Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn to concede to the SNPrsquos demands.But Ms Sturgeon is an experienced political operator and it is inconceivable that she will not have planned for that eventuality. Perhaps too quietly for some, perhaps in too guarded a manner to quell the disquiet from her party, but she will have planned nonetheless.:Nicola Sturgeon in row over unofficial email accountGiven that, it would have been wise of her critics to wait at least until that key moment before declaring that they had lost faith in her ability to secure a second referendum.If some in the SNP got their way, theyrsquod have her abandon moderation and diplomacy during the Brexit crisis. After all, Mr Johnson fights dirty, so why shouldnrsquot she Some may see her unwillingness to play the game under the new, gloves-off, Brexit rules as weakness. Others now question whether she really wants independence at all. In doing so they undermine one of their partyrsquos greatest assets ndash a leader who hasnrsquot lost a sense of perspective and public duty.You get the sense that a chunk of SNP supporters long for the bombastic days of Alex Salmond, believing that in the current political climate, bullishness and bul***t is power. They should be careful what they wish for.When the time comes for Scotland to decide its future, voters will be asked to put their trust in the arguments made by politicians.

For that reason, it may be easy to dismiss the use of the word lsquoinevitablersquo.But I wouldnrsquot. Its users may very well be correct. Sentiment towards independence in Scotland has ticked up, albeit gradually, since the first referendum in .

Brexit cannot be expected to land well in a country in which  per cent of people voted to Remain. A decade of Tory government will inevitably take its toll in a country where the Tories are back down to polling numbers in the low  per cent region.And, most importantly of all for the long-term prospects of the independence movement, the wind of demographic change is very much with them. Bluntly, more newly minted -year-old voters vote yes, and more dying voters vote no.So, the feeling of inevitability amongst the SNP hierarchy - and note that it is they who are pushing this rather than lsquoordinaryrsquo members - looks like it has a solid ballast.

There is another side to this story, and it remains to be seen whether the lurking risks for the yes campaign have been fully baked into their thinking.At the centre of this is the weekend poll showing unionist:nationalist sentiment at :. This was lauded as a breakthrough the first time a Panelbase poll has recorded such success. It is progress - of that there can be absolutely no doubt. But I am not at all convinced that it is enough. It was not so long ago that ostensibly senior people were briefing the media that they considered % pro-independence polling to be the point at which it was safe to agitate for another referendum. They talked of the stars aligningBrexit turned into a quagmireandBoris Johnson became Prime Minister . How many more stars do they need I see a requirement, from the nationalistsrsquo perspective, for the polling to be signicantly higher, because those lurking risks are real, and they provide a very competitive counterweight to the demographic idend.:SNP to scrap council fees for at home careDespite the polling indicating a perceived stronger economic future inside the EU than inside the UK, it remains a moot point whether economics will again be the Achilles Heel of the Yes campaign. It cannot be downplayed - the fiscal deficit is dismal, the currency question is further spiced by the inevitable debate over whether or not Scotland will have to join the Euro, and the Green-inspired drt to the left is creating an electorally worrying gap between personal tax rates north and south of the border, a gap which is only likely to expand.Other signicant drivers of voter behaviour will undoubtedly be more prevalent this time around. Voters in Scotland have had an election or referendum every year since  with the exception of last year, which despite the lack of a poll was anything but stable. By the time the next referendum comes around, we will have had another two national elections and, presumably, a formal exit from the EU.Lenin said there are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen. We are living that, now, and after the UK eventually leaves the EU it is a monumental request of the politically-fatigued Scottish people to plunge themselves into another potentially dficult constitutional negotiation.And then there is the EU relationship itself, in which so much stock is placed. For what itrsquos worth, I think that we are in a manufactured state. I say as a Remain voter that much of the Europhilia coursing through Scotland is faux, with no real foundation. It is a knee-jerk response to current turmoil. When we leave, votersrsquo default assumptions, and the starting point from which they decide which box to cross, will change.In essence, we will be asking Scottish voters to choose the EU over the UK. We will be asking them to leave a union to which they retain a fair emotional attachment, to join one to which their emotional attachment is unproven, at best. We may even be asking them to authorise the creation of some sort of, albeit probably limited, Scotland-England border checks.It is the ask of asks. So much so that I find it dficult to see the SNPrsquos official position being to immediately rejoin the EU. Nicola Sturgeon, on Andrew Marr on Sunday, invoked EFTA as a short-term post-Brexit solution.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThousands of people across Scotland, including folk in Orkney, will get the chance to listen to birdsong in some rather unusual locations tomorrow, October , as part of a RSPB Scotland#s initiative to highlight declines in wildle.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-. Of the ship#s  crew members — many of whom were very young men —  were lost.For more coverage of the events taking place around the anniversary of the sinking of the ship, see this Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, I was shocked to hear that Easyjet would not permit me to travel. Instead, I was advised to go to my ‘embassy’. I explained that I was a UK citizen and, hence, had no embassy in London. The customer services person then told me to go to the passport office – even though I had not lost my passport.”Desperate to catch her flight home, Dr Ruxton visited the passport office as instructed, despite the fact her passport had been left safely at home in Scotland.Read more: Easyjet founder claims victory in ‘Easy’ name battle with ChinaShe said: “As predicted, they told me that, since I had not lost my passport and needed no ID toto Scotland, they could do nothing for me. I even tried to contact DVLA to obtain another driving licence but was told that I had to apply online and it would take a week to arrive - at my home address.”AdviceEasyJet’s customer service team repeatedly told Dr Ruxton that customers are always advised to “validate their travel documents with the local embassy” and that she had needed to obtain an emergency travel document from consular staff - despite her telling them that she was a British citizen and was in the UK.She was forced to borrow money from a work colleague living in London and bought a rail fare to Scotland - at a cost of £.After directly contacting Easyjet’s head of customer relations, John Leighton, via LinkedIn on her , the customer service team eventually offered Dr Ruxton a £ voucher, but reiterated that she should have visited her embassy in London - and had refused to follow their advice.Dr Ruxton said: “I declined the voucher. All I want is for them to say ‘Sorry for giving you the wrong advice’ and refund me the £ I had to pay out for my train fare.“The Easyjet ‘line to take’ – that a UK citizen living in Scotland who has been a victim of crime should have to go to an embassy to prove their identity in order to get home – displays a worrying lack of understanding about the nature of the United Kingdom and a lack of care for customers.”Read more: These are the companies which have been rated the worst for customer serviceThe UK Government confirmed that there was no British Embassy in London for British citizens.A spokesman for EasyJet said: \"We are sorry that Mrs Ruxton and her daughter were unable to travel on their flight on  July and were incorrectly informed, as a UK citizen, to contact the embassy. \"It was correct, however, that photo ID is required as they had hold luggage and so this is required for safety reasons. This meant the documentation she had was not sufficient to be able to travel.

Six years on from a deeply isive debate, here we go again... maybe.But for as long as Scotland keeps electing Scottish National Party governments, this is a question that will not go away – the clue is in the party’s title. Independence is the SNP’s raison d’etre, so it would be rather odd, to put it mildly,they decided to drop the whole idea.However the First Minister’s speech to her party conference offered hope for those fearing a descent into what she called “crude populism” of Donald Trump and co.“That is not for us. That is not who we are,” Sturgeon said.The SNP would win independence not by “demonising those who disagree, and plastering lies on the side of a bus. We will win by inspiring and persuading”.: Nicola Sturgeon says independence referendum ‘must happen’ in : Scottish Independence: One fth of Scots ‘undecided or open minded’ about leaving the UKThe Union and independence arouse strong passions in many of us, but it is important to remember that we all live together in this small country and each of us has a democratic right to our own opinion.We should all try to disagree agreeably.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"sorry mr mackay economic case for union not independence is stronger than ever murdo fraser","story":"SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told his party conference that Scotland could #more than afford to be independent#, but the nationalist prospectus is threadbare, while the unionist case is clear, writes Murdo Fraser.It is generally accepted that politicians can get away with saying things to their party conferences that would be inappropriate in any other setting. Personal attacks on opponents, third-rate jokes, laboured puns, and extravagant claims of future success are all fair game in the conference hall, likely to provoke an enthusiastic response from starry-eyed, ultra-loyal, party activists, many nursing hangovers from the previous night’s festivities.It is in this context that we should view Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s comments to the SNP conference in Aberdeen on Monday, specically his claim that the economic case for independence is “stronger than ever”. Scotland can “more than afford to be independent”, Mr Mackay told SNP delegates.The timing of the Finance Secretary’s comments was somewhat unfortunate, coming out on the very morning that the latest Royal Bank of Scotland PMI report showed that manufacturing firms in Scotland had suffered a sharp drop in output last month, and a steeper decline in new orders. Scotland ranked only above Northern Ireland in parts of the United Kingdom in terms of business confidence, trailing behind the UK average.: Queen’s Speech rejects call to repeat ‘once in a generation’ independence vote: Poll: Support for Scottish independence hits %It is not just on this measure that the Scottish economy is underperforming, after  years of SNP Government. We are in a decade of below average economic growth, with unemployment rates in Scotland higher than the UK average, and employment rates signicantly lower. On one estimate, there are some , more adults of working age in Scotland economically inactive compared to the UK average. Their participation in the workforce would provide a signicant boost to the Scottish economy, not to mention a considerable contribution towards income tax revenues.Independence miracle unlikelyNotwithstanding the SNP’s disappointing track record on economic issues, we are now expected to believe that independence will see a miraculous improvement not just in economic performance, but in our fiscal position. How, exactly, this is likely to come about remains a mystery. The Scottish Government’s own figures told us in August that we run a nominal annual deficit of £.bn, representing seven per cent of Scotland’s GDP. This translates into a Union Dividend of just short of £, for every man, woman and child in Scotland. It is this level of fiscal transfer from other parts of the UK that supports higher levels of public spending here, and these funds would require to be replaced in the event of separationwe were not to see dramatic tax hikes, swingeing public service cuts, or a combination of both.We are still no clearer what exactly the SNP would do to fill Scotland’s fiscal gap post-independence, beyond vague promises about the need to “grow the economy”. At least the  White Paper had one policy proposal which might have driven forward economic growth: the promise to cut corporation tax by three per cent below the UK rate. But even that has now been ditched.SNP politicians will talk about how Scexit will allow Scotland to pursue a more liberal immigration policy, with a growing population driving economic expansion. Scotland’s track record in this area, after  years of SNP Government, gives little cause to be optimistic on that particular front.Woeful lack of planningDespite having free movement of people within the EU for decades, levels of inward migration to Scotland have been lower than average for the UK as a whole. What exactly would reverse this trend and attract more European immigrants to Scotland in the future – with higher taxes than the rest of the UK and with all the economic uncertainties around independence – is far from clear.It is not just on the question of fiscal balances that the SNP’s economic prospectus is threadbare. We are still no clearer as to what exactly the currency of an independent Scotland would be, but the preference now seems to be for ditching the pound sterling and adopting an alternative, presenting clear challenges for Scottish businesses trading with the rest of the UK.Moreover, at the weekend Nicola Sturgeon refused to rule out the prospect of a hard border between the Solway and Tweed in the event of Scexit, again presenting huge challenges for Scottish business. The UK domestic market is worth three times more to Scottish exporters than the value of the EU Single Market, yet the SNP, in an exercise in economic absurdity, wants to prioritise the latter over the former.Against this backdrop, it is little wonder that whilst Scottish businesses whom I speak to on a regular basis may have their concerns about a no-deal Brexit, by far their greater concern is the prospect of independence – with a dferent currency, a hard border, a massive fiscal deficit, and a woeful lack of any long-term plan.If Brexit tells us anything, it is that extracting ourselves from a -year-old economic union is more complex than anyone first imagined. On any logical basis, dissolving a -year-old economic, social and political union will be many times more problematic.The fact is that the economic case for the Union is stronger than ever. Despite all the noise coming out of the SNP conference at Aberdeen this week, there is no evidence that that situation is about to change any time soon.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland presenter judith ralston swears after fluffing weather report","story":"Scottish weather presenter Judith Ralston swore on last nights Seven Days review programme after forgetting part of her report. window.twttr The BBC Scotland presenter was quick to apologise for saying the F-word before her sound was cut.

In the circumstances now Scotland faces, we have a duty to do so.“And it is what we intend to do.”BrexitThe fallout of the  Brexit referendum, which saw Scots vote to remain in the UK, was branded a “disaster” by Ms Sturgeon.She added: “Whatever happens over the next few weeks it will continue to dominate Westminster for years to come. There is no sense in which it will be ‘done’.“We don’t yet know whether the UK will leave with a deal or without. But we do know that neither of these outcomes is in Scotland’s interests.”While she said a no-deal Brexit would be “unthinkable” she added that “a deal of the type Boris Johnson is proposing would not be much better”.The First Minister said: “His plans would take Scotland out of the EU, out of the single market and out of the customs union.” “Let me make this absolutely clear today, SNP MPs will not vote for that - not now, not ever.”With a general election widely expected in the coming months Ms Sturgeon said it “can’t some soon enough.”She added: “When it does our message will be clear, simple and unambiguous - vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland’s right to choose.Ms Sturgeon said: “Some polls suggest that an election might result in a hung parliament.“The SNP will never put the Tories into power.“But I have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support.“If you don’t respect Scotland’s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don’t even bother picking up the phone.”Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the speech showed that Ms Sturgeon’s priorities were not domestic issues her Government has responsibility for.“Nicola Sturgeon wants to be judged on health and education, yet she couldn’t spare a single sentence for either during this y and isive speech,” he said.“Instead, she simply wanted to get through what was a potentially hostile conference with a series of vacuous promises which will never be kept, and throw some red meat to the hardliners.He added: “When she does demand the powers to hold a second unwanted and isive referendum, the answer should be an unequivocal no.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie warned independence would mean “cuts and tax rises.”He added: “Independence will be bad for Scotland just like Brexit because breaking up long term economic partnerships is very hard to do.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, added: “This was a speech full of nationalist rhetoric with no answers about the catastrophic impact of breaking up the UK.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England.

Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community.

I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying.

Thats going to be the starting point going forward.\"It is a ridiculous position to have been placed into, and it shows the total ineptitude of the DUPs so-called negotiating position over the last three years.\"Mr Allister told yesterdays Radio Ulster Nolan Show that the DUP had been \"foolish\" by shting its position on a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which had resulted it in being \"shafted\" by the Government.He told the Belfastthe removal of the \"unionist veto\" would have serious implications for Northern Irelands constitutional future in the UK.\"It is becoming clearer that the DUP were sucked into agreeing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea with the promise of a unionist veto - and once they were sucked in, they are to be shafted,\" Mr Allister said. \"If the unionist veto is to go,there is to be a customs border as well as a regulatory border, and we are to be put in captivity in the EU and removed essentially from the UK economy and put in the orbit of the economy of the Republic - then it is very serious for the future of the Union,\" he continued.Mr Allister called on the DUP to \"disavow\" the regulatory border in the Irish sea, and take a \"step back\".But Sir Jeffrey branded the remarks as unhelpful at a time when unity between unionists is called for.\"This is a time when unionist parties with common ground on Brexit should be working together rather than attacking each other,\" he told the Belfast . \"The DUP has led from the front on Brexit whilst others have remained on the sidelines.\"It is deeply disappointing that some fellow unionists are peddling nonsense against the DUP based on media speculation. \"We want to see a sensible and balanced negotiated agreement as we leave the EU, but arrangements that create barriers to trade in the Irish Sea would not be supported by us,\" Sir Jeffrey added."},{"url":null,"title":"dup held series of meetings with loyalists to discuss eu exit specifics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The warning led to calls for greater engagement with the loyalist community.In a series of tweets yesterday, journalist Brian Rowan alleged that Mrs Foster, along with other senior DUP colleagues, met with Jimmy Birch, Jackie McDonald and Matt Kincaid, who have previously been named as senior UDA figures.At a separate meeting, organised through the auspices of the Action for Community Transformation project, Mr Rowan stated that alleged senior UVF members Winston Irvine and Harry Stockman were present.Read MoreDUP defends its position as rivals claim it’s been ‘suckered’ in Brexit talksThe former BBC NI security editor said it was his view that it was important that loyalists are \"involved included in legacy and other dialogues, including Brexit\".

Is it a good deal  Is it a bad deal  Is it the only deal \"The source continued: \"If Sinn Fein thinks its all right [any Brexit deal] loyalists will think its all wrong.\"Mr Rowan also tweeted that he was told that loyalists are exploring ways for their concerns to be heard outside Northern Ireland and that a \"mechanism means\" to achieve this is currently being explored. According to the Sunday Times, sources within the UVF have said it is planning to organise demonstrations and protests using proxy groupsthe government attempts a Brexit compromise by aligning Northern Ireland and the Republic in any customs arrangement.A DUP spokesperson said: \"The Party engages with a range of stakeholders about a range of matters on an ongoing basis in the interests of moving Northern Ireland forward.\"Meanwhile, the UDA in west Belfast were said to be adopting a \"wait and see\" approach until the specics of any Brexit deal are announced.In response, the Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie had said he believes that the loyalist community has not been engaged with enough on Brexit issues.Commenting on the alleged meetings between the loyalist representatives and the DUP, loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson said there was \"nothing controversial\" about the largest unionist party engaging with a \"signicant section\" of the unionist and loyalist community.\"I dont think theres anything overly signicant about that however, I do think the DUP should be listening to the voices of the grassroots in the unionist and loyalist community,\" he added. \"I do think in the past number of days we have certainly seen a change from the DUPs position last week where they were ultimately almost signing up for an economic united Ireland. I wasnt present at any of these meetings.

Foryou know who should hear ya, you know what youd get..pushThose lyrics kept repeating in my head after the summit between An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar and British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Nobody was saying much about anything.And the chorus wasnt much better. Take the words of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, on the meeting: \" I am not going into the details of the negotiations.\" Then Micheal Martin. Leader of Fianna Fail: \" The less said in public, the better!\" And the Taoiseach, in rare harmony, said: \"I wont be going into detail as its sensitive. When in discussions, the less said, the better.\" Read MoreDUP warns PM it wont back any deal that traps us in EUSuzanne Breen: The national embarrassment, everyone agrees we deserve better but no one has the guts to change things Of course, they are talking about Brexit deadlines, deals and the orce that dare not speak its name.In fairness, the mood music around the Merseyside summit was good. It would not have lasted three hours had it not been reasonably constructive.The Taoiseach and Prime Minister appeared to have a good rapport.Personal relationships are important at times of crisis.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetSometimes An Taoiseach is easily flattered and Mr Johnson is well known for his powers of seduction - so the optics come with a heavy qualication. The key is whether both parties feel the same way the morning after the night before.The format of the day was unusual. Meetings occurred between the British and Irish teams, then reduced down to handful of key advisors and both Prime Ministers. This was followed by a brisk walk and some couple time for the two leaders.Much can be lost in translation from such a format. Understandings and undertakings may become blurred. Could it all be a charm offensive to prepare for the blame game  Maybe, but I think not. Johnson needs a deal. As does Leo. And so does Northern Ireland.The morning after and the goodwill seems to have prevailed all the way to Brussels for the meeting between Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, and EU Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The semi news block out is necessary. All too often, careless talk, sniping briefings and megaphone diplomacy has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.This is not the time to allow the futures of two neighbouring countries, who have joint stewardship of the problem child - Northern Ireland - to have their negotiations dissected and pulled apart by Twitter trolls, jumped up bovver boys, madcap lefties and right wing loonies.There will be nervousness within the DUP ranks. Further pragmatism may be required.They should face up to this because such pragmatism will not change the constitutional position of NI within the UK.It will demonstrate maturity and it delivers on the joint Executive Letter of August , signed by Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness and their stated desire for a soft landing for NI post Brexit.Being mature, leading from the front and not bowing to the lowest common denominator in loyalism would do much to restore the cross-community credibility the DUP lost during the past , days.Johnsons electoral success depends on delivering a Brexit which is recognised as such by voters in Britain. If there is a ranking order for his priorities, it is wherever his votes are. They are not in Northern Ireland, as the Tories hardly register on the Richter scale.The alignment of some in the DUP to the Brexit Party is like hitching a lt on a Catherine wheel, momentarily exciting, all sparks, only to fizzle out like a damp squib.Farage never looks like a man who wants a full-time political job. Post Brexit, his party will disintegrate, as did its predecessor, UKIP.Sinn Feins leadership has been unusually quiet. Mary Lou gave a cautious welcome to the news there was positive vibes coming from the Anglo-Irish summit.When a Brexit deal didnt look at all possible, some in Sinn Fein hoped a crash out of the EU would lead to the type of chaos which would anger nationalist voters. Thus giving a timely lt to a party languishing in the polls in the Republic.The campaign to have a border poll will also stallJohnsons government can pull off the elusive deal.However, the idea of a bespoke NI referendum on the customs union or back stop is a real possibility. That said, every election in Northern Ireland is a quasi border poll.The Tories will never concede on a border poll whilst in hoc to the DUP. The momentum has, for the time being, left any prospect for a border poll years away. Unionists should take comfort in that, too.Deal or no deal - Sinn Fein probably thought they could still make electoral advantage from either outcome.If, and its a huge , a no-deal Brexit is avoided, Sinn Fein will come under huge pressure to go back into the Assembly and restore the Executive. The question is, will they In the meantime, remember For the less you say, the less you hear andanyone asks who told you, then Please dont mention me!"},{"url":null,"title":"trading suspended in another woodford fund after disgraced manager resigns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

of the fund and close down his investment management business after he was sacked from his flagship £ billion Woodford Equity Income Fund, which will now be wound up.We will consider the options available to us including the appointment of an alternate investment manager, a scheme of arrangement into another fund or a winding-up of the fundLink Fund SolutionsThe equity income fund had been frozen since June, locking thousands of investors out of their cash and plunging Mr Woodford’s investment empire into crisis.Link said it is looking at the possibility of appointing an alternative investment manager for the income focus fund, but is also considering winding it up.In a letter to investors, Link said: “After consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the fund’s assets, we have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of all investors in the fund to suspend the issue, cancellation, sale and redemption of shares in the fund.“The period of suspension is intended to protect investors from this anticipated increased level of redemptions in the fund.”It added that as a “forced seller” of its assets, it may not achieve the best value, which could impact on shares for investors remaining in the fund.“During the fund’s suspension, we will consider the options available to us including the appointment of an alternate investment manager, a scheme of arrangement into another fund or a winding-up of the fund, and decide on the course of action that is in the best interests of all investors,” Link said.The income focus fund is the smallest of three funds that were run by Woodford Investment Management.Its sister fund, Woodford Patient Capital trust – a listed business – remains open for trading, but shares have been badly affected and were down another % on Wednesday.The income focus fund, launched in March , has seen its assets under management more than halve over the past six months – down to £ million from £. million at the end of April.Most of this has been down to an investor exodus, as well as poor performance.Its holdings are quoted, which means they are likely to be easier to sell than assets held in the equity income fund, but it does have exposure to medium-sized and smaller companies, which can be hard to sell out of.The demise of the Woodford equity income fund marked the end of Mr Woodford’s investment management business – and his career as a star stockpicker.He said on Tuesday he would close down his business, which was founded in  after more than  years at Invesco

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us. This will be a relaxed evening where we can sit back and listen to the enthralling stories from those glory days.The event will be sponsored by The Irish News and the organising committee would like to thank them for their support and backing.Tickets can be purchased in OrsquoToolersquos bar, Loughinisland GAC clubrooms, or by contacting the clubrsquos Facebook page, email loughinislandgac@gmail, or calling  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Armstrong.jpg","title":"Armstrong takes second at Lurgan  ","story":"THE first round of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross League, hosted by Apollo CC at Lurgan Park, took place on Sunday.It was certainly a testing time for the course setters. There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

Andra Hamilton was enjoying the course and claimed a battling th place.The final race of the day was the menrsquos A race which saw Barry Kellett, Neil Armstrong and Derek Graham take to the start line.Kellett showed that moving the M category certainly hasnrsquot slowed him down as he battled with his younger rival Graham Boyd, from McConvey Cycles, for the top spot.This time it was Graham who held on to take the win, but an excellent second place and top M for Barry.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie. I think adults could learn from children as they might ask a question about the arm but once itrsquos answered, they move on as they are very accepting..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Brief.jpg","title":"Brief to redevelop Irish Street closer  ","story":"A DEVELOPMENT brief designed to transform the former Irish Street police station site in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent empty buildings could be ready within weeks, the Down Recorder understands.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy.Final agreement has been reached with all key stakeholders to draw up a dedicated team to come up with a development brief which will outline what the local authority would like to see developed at a huge area of land.The brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area, while there are also plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise its potential and make the most of its historical heritage.When completed, the development brief will be advertised, inviting third parties to come forward with viable proposals for the site that will result in sustainable regeneration in Downpatrick town centre.It has also been confirmed that permission has been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.A number of the vacant buildings will be bulldozed to open up a huge area at the rear of the former police station, with the proposed development site also including the local authority-owned car park.But the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious multi-million pound regeneration plan. It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo.

A new shop front is also proposed alongside a new deli area, sanitary and internal seating facilities.Existing petrol pumps, fuel talks and canopy will also be replaced as part of the signicant investment proposal, alongside additional parking.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners say they received one objection to the proposal from a resident who lives nearby, with  neighbours notied about the proposal.The objection relates to proposals for changes to a traffic island outside the store on the busy Dundrum Road.The planning papers say the proposal will result in the relocation of eight fuel pumps and canopy along with an existing car wash, with the current retail unit extended. Additional fuel pumps also form par of the development proposal.Planners say that the redevelopment of the Barbican filling station is compatible with surrounding land use, will not harm the amenities of nearby residents, with the filling station and retail unit not at any risk from flooding.Signicantly, planners are content that the existing road network can cope with any extra vehicular activity at the Dundrum Road site and that adequate access arrangements and parking area is in place.One of the existing accesses to the site will be lost as a result of the redevelopment.Recommending that the amended plans should be approved, planners say that the site must only be used as a petrol filling station with no part used for the display or sale of vehicles and that all existing fuel tanks must be removed in line with current pollution guidance.Councillors will be told at next weekrsquos planning meeting thatduring development works, contamination risks are encountered which have not previously been identied, works should cease and planners notied immediately.The storersquos opening hours will remain unchanged when the redevelopment work is completed.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Later this month, the council will formally open Downpatrickrsquos new poundm household recycling centre at the Flying Horse Road which officials are confident can help increase the districtrsquos recycling rate.Earlier this year, polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk revealed details of a Province-wide recycling survey which indicated that one third of householders in the area were unhappy with how the local authority had asked them to recycle.In addition, the survey claimed % of those surveyed would only recycle when it is convenient for them, with % indicating that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling including glass, a service that until April this was unavailable in the former Down Council area.Local authority officials say that the local council has already moved to make recycling simple and convenient, with ratepayers able to place glass in their blue bins to make recycling from home as easy as possible.Council officers said the Lucid Talk survey revealed that recycling is important to % of residents across the district, % higher than the national average and that % of those who have used the local authorityrsquos recycling services were satisfied.With increased emphasis on recycling, Newry, Mourne and Down Council recently confirmed innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.To date,  groups have expressed an interest in using items left by the public at the three local centres including bicycles, furniture, paint, building materials and household bric-a-brac. A pilot project is being launched this month which will run until the end of March.Groups that have expressed an interest in taking part in the pilot include the Inverbrena Community Association in Strangford, Newcastle Community Cinema, the Downpatrick-based charity Le Change, Changes Lives, Castlewellan Regeneration, St Vincent de Paul and MYMY in Newcastle, Habitat for Humanity.The local authority has agreed a formal reuse system with the pilot scheme monitored monthly to test how successful it is.Moving forward, council officials plan to work with representatives from local groups and charities to understand their particular needs and the items they are keen to secure for their respective organisations.It has also been confirmed that a rota will be established to ensure that collection dates can be arranged for the groups and charities which sign up to the scheme.Council officials plan to liaise with the ious groups to agree collection days and advertise the scheme, with contact be made with the Environment Agency to regulate the reuse initiative.Groups keen to recycle items which have been left at the local centres will also be required to submit a business case detailing how they will be collected, refurbished and reused, in addition to maintaining a record of all material removed.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke ,has welcomed the scheme to allow local groups to reuse items left at the districtrsquos household recycling centres.ldquoI very much welcome this scheme which will operate as a pilot and be reviewed monthly, he said.While these groups cannot remove electrical items from local centres I believe the decision which prevents them from being used by local groups should be reviewed.

aspects of the scheme include upgrading existing traffic signal equipment and the introduction of a one-way traffic systemon Lower Stream Street from the junction towards Racecourse Hill.Roads officials say the scheme should improve traffic progression and that due to the nature of the work involved, it will be necessary to operate a number of off-peak road and lane closures.Signed ersions will be provided with the Department of Infrastructure asking motorists to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with care when travelling through, or in the vicinity of the

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Cabinet briefing on Brexit at  Downing Street, LondonA Number  source said progress was still being made in the talks, which ran to about .am in the Belgian capital and will resume on Wednesday morning.Reports had suggested a deal was close ahead of a midnight deadline imposed by the EU, with the Prime Minister said to be making major concessions on the Irish border..ev-modals .modal.in

.desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button But sources on both sides of the Channel downplayed the suggestions, and the PMs official spokesman said: \"Talks remain constructive but there is more work still to do.\"The PM is expected to update his Cabinet on progress in the negotiations on Wednesday afternoon.A Downing Street source said: \"Constructive talks, worked into the night, continue to make progress, continue in the morning.\"If the PM succeeded in bringing a deal home to the UK, he would then face a battle to do what Theresa May failed to do three times and get it approved by Parliament.Hardline Brexiteers from the European Research Groupof Tory backbenchers and the DUP were both courted in Downing Street on Tuesday.ERG chairman and self-styled \"Brexit hardman\" Steve Baker later said he was \"optimistic\" that Mr Johnsons team would finalise a \"tolerable deal that I will be able to vote for\".But a split among the hardliners became visible over reports that Mr Johnson may agree to a border down the Irish Sea.Former environment secretary Owen Paterson said in an interview with The Sun that it was \"unacceptable\" that custom checks could be carried out on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader and a former ERG chair, however thinks an agreement could be accepted by MPs, telling LBC: \"I think the votes are there now for a deal.\"Stormont under fire for failing to review £bn PFI debt - four times original cost to taxpayer Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The DUP has helped prop up the Tory administration following increased funding from Mr Johnsons predecessor in Number  as part of a confidence and supply deal, in a £ billion package branded as a \"bribe\".There is speculation more money could be headed in the way of Arlene Fosters party as the PM tries to get them on board with any concessions. reported senior sources on both sides of the Channel saying that a draft treaty could be published on Wednesday morning after the UK agreed in principle there will be a customs border in the Irish Sea.The DUP were decidedly lukewarm on the mooted proposals in a statement after their second audience with the PM in as many days.\"We respect the fact negotiations are ongoing and therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required,\" a spokesman said.Ms Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds slipped out of the back exit of Downing Street and avoided waiting journalists following the meeting.Pressure to sign off on a draft agreement is peaking. A legal text needs to be published ahead of the summitthe EU are to consider ratying the Withdrawal Agreement at the two-day summit.Their approval would allow Mr Johnson to put the deal to MPs in a proposed extraordinary sitting of Parliament on Saturday.This would give him a chance to avoid a monumental clash over asking for a Brexit extension - something he has repeatedly ruled out doing but is compelled to do so under the Benn Act.That legislation passed by MPs opposed to a no-deal, including Tory rebels, orders the PM to ask Brussels for an Article  extension until the end of JanuaryParliament does not back a deal.But there are fears Mr Johnson will find a loophole to avoid making the request as part of his \"do or die\" commitment to leave the bloc by the October  deadline.If a Saturday showdown in Parliament is to take place the Government must put a motion before the Commons on Wednesday, to be voted upon on Thursday.During the weekend session, MPs would be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or discuss what to do next in the Brexit saga.The Liberal Democrats have put forward an amendment to the Queens Speech for Tuesday to test whether there is support for a second referendum.And leader Jo Swinson has suggested her Remain-backing party could support a Johnson dealit is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote.\"We will back a referendum whether its on Boris Johnsons deal, whether its on Theresa Mays deal, because we think it should be the public that are in charge and are having that say,\" she told BBC Radio s Today programme.try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaThese are the emotional scenes at Wrightbus as news emerges up to ,

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop.

This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.
