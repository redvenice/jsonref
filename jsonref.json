The women were mostly comedians who said he asked to watch them masturbate or forced them to watch him masturbate.For years rumors swirled that the comedian used his status and power to harass female comedians.After the allegations arose, the comedian immediately confessed they were true.\u0027These stories are true. What I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d*ck isn\u0027t a question. It\u0027s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly,\u0027 he said in a statement released just a day after the allegations came forward.Despite his confession, he faced no legal consequences for the sexual misconduct.However, his stand-up special was cut from Netflix and his relationship with HBO and FX were also axed.Just nine months later he returned to the spotlight but has faced backlash and has seen protesters angrily rally outside his shows.  Louis C.K. in Tampa: No phones, no protests, no saying the word ‘Parkland’"},{"url":null,"title":"Couple ordered chop 40ft trees neighbour complained left garden darkness","story":"Michael and Val Pace have been ordered to cut their 40ft trees in Helensburgh, Scotland, to no more than 6ft.

The subject of books, documentaries and endless tributes, he is almost bigger in death than he was in life.As GQ Editor Dylan Jones, the author of one of these books, says, Bowie is a ‘continually expanding balloon that refuses to burst’.All of which makes the recollection of Bowie as a middle-aged seducer of teenage groupies, shared via a podcast by comedian David Baddiel, feel wildly jarring.Baddiel said last weekend that he was told the story by one of his female friends about a ‘romance’ with Bowie while the singer and Mick Jagger were holidaying in Mustique. He said: ‘This woman was 16 at the time and Bowie would have been in his 40s.She and her best friend had one of many drinking nights with Bowie and ended up back at their shack with David.‘David was clearly keen on a threesome and had put some work in to create it. The way he did this, according to her, was to take all his clothes off and put Let’s Dance on cassette and dance naked.‘It worked for David as both the girls got naked. There were sexual goings-on but she didn’t sleep with David. I said: “Why on earth would you not want to lose your virginity to David Bowie?” She replied: “It wouldn’t mean anything to him. I didn’t want to do that for him, just one night.”          Bowie was said to have slept with a 16-year-old girl while on holiday in the Caribbean island of Mustique‘Instead she went outside. David did s*** the friend, then came out and tried to make it all right with her because she was a bit p***** off.’Bowie fans already knew about the wild times in the early Seventies — to be clear, it’s not illegal to sleep with a 16-year-old — but was he really in the habit of seducing teenagers when he was middle aged?It appears so. Put simply, Bowie was described by his friends as a ‘sex addict’ with a catalogue of lovers old and young, male and female, and a tremendous appetite for all.This week, the Mail has spoken to two women who were under the age of consent when they slept with Bowie. Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15, explained: ‘I never thought of David Bowie as a paedophile. He would f**k anything. If he liked it he would f**k it.’          Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15Early girlfriend Dana Gillespie concurred, telling me: ‘As far as sex went, if it moved, he was there. Man, woman, old or young. Times have changed and it doesn’t always look so good in black and white now, but in those days we were just having fun there were no rules.’It’s a matter of record that he dallied with famous women including Charlie Chaplin’s widow Oona, 22 years older, and actress Bette Midler, plus Bianca Jagger, Susan Sarandon and Lulu.There were always rumours of some kind of liaison with his friend and friendly rival Mick Jagger, and he also had affairs with male mime artist Lindsay Kemp and Natasha Korniloff, Kemp’s costume designer — at the same time. Finding out he was two-timing them, both attempted suicide.Sometimes, having sex was a way of gain an advantage. Former wife Angie said: ‘Using sex was what David did. He used sex to endear himself to people, so they loved him and did things for him and worked hard to promote him. It was the pure selfishness of wanting to succeed.’But at other times, his promiscuity seemed more simply a habit which he enjoyed too much to consider amending.As he said in a 1997 radio interview: ‘I was hitting on everybody. I had a wonderfully irresponsible promiscuous time.’The sexual free-for-all characterised his open marriage to Angie, whom he wed in 1970. She wrote in her autobiography: ‘David made a virtual religion of slipping the lance of love into almost everyone around him.’ Some lovers they shared, others they did not. By his 1972 tour of America he was with Cyrinda Foxe, a 19-year-old model. She recalled that he sent for her while he was having sex with a groupie because he needed someone to talk to. Former assistant Tony Zanetta said David had sex with Puerto Rican transsexuals while in New York.

After the set he came up behind her and brushed her hair, and then asked if he could come home with her (she later worked out that this was because he was going to miss the last train back to Bromley.)They made love. She was 14, and he was 17.Dana told me: ‘I have never thought of David as someone who liked young girls in particular. He liked bright women.‘It has been suggested to me that him sleeping with me when I was 14 was “statutory rape” but I have said to writers, look, you can’t put that in because, yes, I was young but we were just having fun.‘He would play my guitar and listen to my songs, and play me his. I remember he once phoned me up to tell me that he had just written Space Oddity. He wrote the song Andy Warhol for me.‘We were friends for the first ten years of his career, I didn’t see him really after 1975. I wouldn’t call myself a girlfriend, we did all of that and got it out of our system.‘It was not the kind of relationship where I would ever have wanted to be Mrs Bowie.‘When I was 15 or 16 I would hear from him every three or four months. He would come round and I would cook him brown rice and vegetables because he wasn’t eating properly. I remember once he came round and said that his heart was a bit broken because he had trouble with Hermione (Farthingale, his ballet dancer girlfriend.)‘He did not talk about the emotional stuff, I guess you could say that he was a rather cold character because everything came second to ambition.’As David became more famous, he caught the attention of the notorious ‘baby groupies’ who were on the scene in Los Angeles at the time.Led by Californian wild child Sable Starr, who had a romance with Iggy Pop when she was 13, the girls competed to bed visiting British stars.One of their number was Lori Maddox, also known as Lori Mattix. She was 14 when she first met Bowie at the E Club on Sunset Strip and was working as a model. He was on his Spiders From Mars tour of 1972.She turned him down that night, but five months later Bowie returned to LA and she was called by his bodyguard, Stuey.She and friend Sable Starr went for dinner with Bowie at the Rainbow Bar \u0026amp Grill, and then back to his suite at the Beverly Hilton. Lori recalls that Bowie walked her through to the bathroom, stripped off his kimono and climbed into the tub with her. Then she says, he took her virginity. Later she had her first threesome, with Bowie and Sable (who died aged only 51). Lori was 15.Now she reflects on the episode with satisfaction. She said this week: ‘I don’t even think he thought about my age, he was so anti-social and breaking boundaries everywhere.‘I don’t think it was a thought for him and I don’t think he was hanging out with a lot of underage people. We were young then and he was 25, that is still young as well.‘The rockers must have known we were underage girls, maybe that was part of it for them, the innocence, I don’t know.    David Bowie married supermodel Iman in a private ceremony in Switzerland back in 1992‘David was so gentle and kind with me when we were together. It could have been some creepy guy who threw me on the bed and like raped me. It was a different thing, he took me by the hand and was a gentleman. He was a fascinating creature. Was I supposed to do it with some Algebra teacher in the back of his van? I was the last of the virgins at my school, too.‘Do I regret it? No, life goes on. I am 60 years old and it was 45 years ago. People should get over it. You go through a journey in life, I don’t believe in mistakes, I believe there is a destiny for everybody.‘David was not a star yet so he did not take advantage of any celebrity with me. I remained friends with him throughout his rise to fame and he would always check in with me to see how I was doing in my life. We were friends.‘I was a teen model. David was very androgynous and he liked to be around cool and interesting looking people. It was all pure fun. It was a different time in rock ’n’ roll. We did not have internet or cell phones or anything like that.‘He was attracted to that glam rock scene out here where we were all cheating and being unacceptable. It was all good, pure fun. I do not feel like I was taken advantage of, not at all. We were all just hanging out.’ She added: ‘He was fascinating for anybody. David was an anomaly, he was just not normal. He had carrot red hair, no eyebrows, he was magnificently beautiful, the skin, the cheekbones, those two different coloured eyes.

It could yet turn into a political earthquake with profound consequences for how Brexit is achieved.It is estimated that about 160 Labour MPs represent constituencies that voted Leave. One Labour backbencher says: \u0027My constituency is not a big letter-writing constituency or an email-writing one. But I\u0027m getting lots on Brexit. They all say the same thing: \u0027The country voted to Leave, make sure we do.\u0027 \u0027Another tells me that he expects alarmed constituents to stop him for chats and reassurance when he goes to his local supermarket today.Rebels in retreat!

Don\u0027t let us down.\u0027 \u0027 The message is simple: Get on with it!Some voters quote the infamous leaflet posted to every household by the Cameron government during the referendum campaign which said: \u0027This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide.\u0027They also point to the Labour manifesto from the 2017 General Election which contained an unambiguous promise to uphold the result of the referendum.This pressure — which ratchets daily as March 29 Brexit Day gets closer — is being applied across great swathes of the North of England and the Midlands where voters backed Leave and now scent betrayal.They look to Westminster and see plots to delay Article 50, which is the clause in the EU\u0027s Treaty of Lisbon that sets out how a country can leave the union.          This is the biggest game of political poker played for many decades. The stakes couldn\u0027t be higher for the players and for the countrySuch moves are being orchestrated by backbenchers like Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper, a fierce Europhile despite representing a heavily Leave-supporting Yorkshire seat.She is expected to make another blocking manoeuvre in the Commons on Thursday — cynically camouflaged as a means of avoiding a No Deal Brexit.Some of her Labour colleagues have gone the other way. They have chosen to break with Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s line and have supported the Government, or abstained, in critical Brexit votes. These include the independent-minded Caroline Flint, whose Don Valley seat in South Yorkshire voted more than 2:1 for Leave.This week, she hinted that with the right assurances, she could back Theresa May, saying: \u0027The British people expect us to work together to sort Brexit.\u0027Others on the Labour benches are keeping low — quietly terrified about being vilified for voting against Mrs May\u0027s deal and being seen to be sabotaging Brexit.\u0027They don\u0027t want to go back to their constituencies and say they have not delivered on it,\u0027 a Labour MP says. Labour whips — who are responsible for cajoling their fellow MPs to follow the party line — whisper that the number of rebels is growing.Indeed, a Tory minister mischievously credits the rising number of pliable Labour-Leave MPs for his growing optimism about Brexit going ahead.For her part, Mrs May is wisely investing a huge effort in winning over these Labour waverers, inviting small groups to No 10 to listen to their concerns and trying to find ways to bring them onside.You might call this Operation Code Red as No 10 works out a strategy to coax amenable Labour MPs into backing the May Withdrawal Deal.In the coming days, expect her to make a significant offer of new laws on workers\u0027 rights and the environment. These issues may be identified, traditionally, with Labour, but they are central to the PM\u0027s own agenda. So they would be easy concessions and would not offend her own side.In addition, Mrs May will make pledges of investment in Leave-voting areas — regardless of accusations of \u0027bribery\u0027. And why should she not, if it helps get Brexit through?The plain truth is that many Leave-voting areas are desperate for more public funds — something emphasised by Labour Brexiteer MP John Mann in an article in the Mail last week.Indeed, Labour voters would be furious if their MP rejected the opportunity for their area to have new schools, roads, hospitals or other infrastructure.As former Labour MP Frank Field, who now sits as an independent in Birkenhead, put it last week: \u0027If the Government is going to give us money for doing what we think is right, what\u0027s actually wrong with that?\u0027 It is also true that many Labour Leave voters respect Mrs May personally, despite their natural party allegiance. They admire her determination and forbearance under great pressure.Their support may go some way to explaining how two polls in the past week have put the Tories seven points ahead of Labour.What\u0027s more, Mrs May\u0027s cause among such folk has most definitely been boosted by EU Council chief Donald Tusk. His incendiary remarks this week may have been aimed at the leaders of the Leave campaign, who he said deserve a \u0027special place in Hell\u0027.But however they were intended, many Leavers will have taken them as a personal insult.Pressure from Labour Leavers may also help explain Corbyn\u0027s decision to come off the fence on Brexit this week. By narrowing his \u0027key tests\u0027 for Mrs May\u0027s deal, he sent a message that Labour is not a roadblock to Brexit.Of course, this does not mean Mrs May can expect any help from the Labour front bench. They will find any excuse to vote against her if they sniff the chance to bring down the Government.Meanwhile, it must be stressed, too, that Mrs May has to win over all 316 other Tory MPs.As it became clear this week, she is going to go to the wire in the hope of extracting something from Brussels on the Northern Ireland backstop which will placate the rebellious rump of hardline Brexiteers.On the other side of the Tory ide on Europe, she needs her Remainer MPs who fear No Deal to \u0027hold their nerve\u0027, as Chancellor Philip Hammond put it.If they pull the rug from underneath her by voting to delay Brexit, she\u0027ll have scant hope of securing any meaningful concession from the EU.This is the biggest game of political poker played for many decades. The stakes couldn\u0027t be higher for the players and for the country. Of course, when the last chips go in, someone will lose everything.As we begin the final, treacherous descent to March 29, Theresa May must win over hardline Tory Eurosceptics. That is still a huge challenge.Yet, if she fails to do so, it could be Labour MPs in Leave seats, looking at their bulging postbags and conscious of the increasingly noisy clamour for Brexit to \u0027just happen\u0027, who eventually help get her over the line.  Will jailbird MP return to Commons with electronic tag?It is 11 days since Labour MP Fiona Onasanya was jailed for three months for perverting the course of justice.Eleven days have passed without a word of contrition from her or the grace to concede that she must relinquish her job as Peterborough’s MP.This impasse is the result of her own disgraceful obduracy — but also because of pathetically lax parliamentary rules which stipulate that an MP only loses their seat automatically if they are imprisoned for 12 months or more. And so a shameless Onasanya is allowed to keep pocketing her £77,000 salary while her 71,000 constituents are not represented properly.To make matters worse, I am reliably informed that the solicitor is likely to be freed from prison after serving just 28 days, under an early release scheme.Onasanya would then be required to wear an electronic tag and obey a curfew. But there would be nothing — apart from common decency — to stop her returning to the Commons."},{"url":null,"title":"Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable calls assisted dying legalised","story":"    Sir Vince Cable has called for assisted dying to be legalised in a moving article that will reopen the debate around the emotive subjectBut a decade on, he had been convinced a change in the law was needed by the moving stories of constituents who chose to end their lives.‘When Parliament finally lifts its gaze beyond the all-consuming Brexit debate, it will have to think about some of the big ethical and political issues out there,’ he writes.‘Assisted dying is one of them. Government should take the lead but, failing that, I am one of a growing number of MPs willing to support private members’ legislation in Parliament.’ Sir Vince said his previous objections had been based on fears that ‘greedy relatives’ could take advantage of lax laws to force elderly people to end their lives.He warned that there would need to be ‘strict safeguards’ built in to protect the patient and the doctors involved and to prevent a ‘slippery slope’.He said he and his current wife Rachel had decided that they would both support assisted dying if they were suffering.\u0027By the time you read this I\u0027ll be dead\u0027: British man, 80,...Police arrest a woman, 89, and man, 68, on suspicion of...Share this articleEuthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK. Parliament has consistently voted against changing the law.Mr Whaley, 80, a retired accountant from Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, wrote a letter to MPs describing his anguish at police inquiries into his case. The motor neurone disease sufferer said his final weeks had been blighted by officers questioning his wife Ann over her involvement in his plan to end his life at Dignitas.Meanwhile, it emerged that two people were arrested on suspicion of assisting suicide after Ralph Snell, 94, was found dead at his home in Lymington, Hampshire.Yesterday police said that an 89-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man had been released from custody under investigation.   I couldn\u0027t let my wife suffer if her life became unbearableCommentary by Vince Cable One of the most difficult issues as an MP is to face a constituent who has a life or death problem and you are unable, for reasons of conscience, to help or support them.This was the position I found myself in for most of my parliamentary career when faced with people seeking relief from a painful and distressing illness through ‘assisted dying’, or their grieving relatives.I encountered some terrible cases, particularly people entering the advanced stages of motor neurone disease when, fully conscious of their condition, patients are – for example –unable to swallow and face the prospect of choking to death. I had to say, ‘Sorry, I don’t believe in “assisted dying”.’          Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and his second wife Rachel in the New ForestI have now changed my mind. My original opposition was not based on religious doctrine, though I do respect and understand the belief that we must not devalue life itself.My views had been formed, as they are for many people, by personal experience. My mother died some years ago a sad and frightened old lady in her 80s, in a fog of confusion brought on by a combination of dementia and long-standing mental illness.          Vince Cable\u0027s first wife Olympia (pictured) died 14 years after being diagnosed with breast cancerWhen I was in my early teens she was confined for a long time to a psychiatric hospital after suffering a breakdown – what would now be called post-natal depression (the baby being my brother). She was pronounced cured and released and she recovered with the help of adult education which made up for the schooling she missed as a teenage factory girl.But she was always somewhat diminished and lacking in confidence and, in her advanced years, her mental state deteriorated.When I visited her towards the end of her life she sometimes begged to die, to be released from her unhappy state but on other occasions she insisted on her love of life simple pleasures like a walk in the park, and by the river.Without self-worth, however, she was obsessed about being a ‘burden’. I could see all too clearly that, in a permissive regime for assisted dying, fragile and muddled people like my mother would easily be persuaded to sign up.My other experience stemmed from my late wife Olympia who died 14 years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Her last few years with crumbling bones and loss of mobility were very difficult, undignified and painful too.But she was a brave, resilient and positive woman who wanted to keep going as long as she could. She actually hung on until I had been re-elected in 2001, giving whatever practical help she could in bed and at the end of a telephone.And her last wish was to die at home surrounded by her family and with their love. The whole notion of assisted dying never crossed her lips and she would have been appalled at the idea. And that confirmed my prejudice.I have since met people who feel strongly in the opposite direction: who are not confused or mentally ill but deadly serious and consistent who may not have the option of being at home with a loving family who face ending their lives either in constant pain or with no dignity. And they don’t have the money to be flown to a clinic in Switzerland.I respond with arguments about ‘slippery slopes’ and how a system of assisted dying could be abused by greedy relatives bringing pressure to bear and overworked doctors (or worse) signing on the dotted line if asked and how the elderly and disabled would fear coming under pressure to stop ‘being a burden’.Having talked at length to some of the campaigners for assisted dying it is clear that these fears and reservations can be addressed: that strict safeguards can be built in to protect both the patient and the doctors involved.There have been several attempts in recent years to change the law under which it is an offence to encourage or assist suicide (attempted suicide itself was decriminalised in 1961). Dozens of cases are referred to the police but prosecutions are rare.The Supreme Court has declined to intervene and change the law by saying, rightly, that this is a matter for Parliament.Recent attempts to legislate have failed but the process has established the principles and the safeguards. Persons must have a terminal illness, medically certified. They must be mentally capable. A judge must be satisfied that the request is voluntary, settled and informed and the signed request must be made in front of a witness and countersigned by two doctors.Doctors would have every right to opt out of the process on conscience grounds. There is a ‘cooling off’ period for reconsideration. These considerations could be strengthened or modified.It was striking that when the issue was last debated in Parliament there were some powerful contributions from those, like Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, who admitted (like me) to have changed their minds. He said: ‘In my view it is a profoundly Christian and moral thing to devise a law that enables people, if they choose, to end their lives with dignity.’A few weeks ago, I asked my wife Rachel – I am happily remarried – what she thought of this issue, if either of us should be afflicted by some dreadful illness.

Does anybody love anybody anyway?” As both these authorities agree – not to mention those who maintain variously that it’s a “battlefield”, a “drug”, a “many-splendored thing”, or “a stranger in an open car who’ll tempt you in and drive you far away” – love is a tricky concept to get a handle on.Here is a cheery, chatty book with a smilewince-inducing play on words in the title and a slightly misleading subtitle, offering to make things clearer. Laura Mucha usefully tells us, for instance, that the ancient Greeks used no fewer than seven different words for love, one of which wasn’t even Greek: storge (for the natural affection a parent feels for a child), eros (for romantic love), ludus (for playful affection between children or casual lovers), philia (for loving friendship), pragma (for “mature love, including patience, tolerance and compromise”), philautia (for self-love), and agape (for “selfless, unconditional love that expects nothing in return”).Those distinctions still seem to be serviceable, though of course they aren’t absolute – and admit of further subisions. Among the themes that emerge in Mucha’s discussion are the ease of mistaking lust for love (both, perhaps, being aspects of eros) – and of how relationships prosper in the long term when eros can be eased into a mixture of pragma and philia with, perhaps, a dash of agape stirred in. That is, once the sex goes and the noisy eating of soup becomes noticeable, kindness and companionate affection are what will keep you going. As Stevie Smith put it: “I am no longer passionate  But we can have some conversation before it is too late.”Yet Mucha’s subtitle is, as I say, is a little misleading. This isn’t really a book of science, and Mucha isn’t really a scientist (according to her website she “worked as a face painter, studied flying trapeze, philosophy and psychology, and swam in Antarctica before becoming a lawyer at an international law firm”). Her main selling point, for the purposes of this book, is that she is a fantastic nosy parker. As she represents it in her introduction, the bulk of original evidence in Love Factually comes from her lifelong habit of buttonholing complete strangers and asking them about their love lives.For a decade, she says, she “approached hundreds of people in airports, shops, markets, cafes, restaurants, bars, hospitals, parks, galleries, libraries, museums, buses, trains, planes and ships. I interviewed a pro American footballer by accident, a model who sat next to me on a plane, teenagers making noise on a bus, the bin man who worked at the local train station … interviewed people in French, Polish, Spanish and English … travelled over a quarter of a million miles, interviewing people from eight to 95 years of age on every continent of the world.” Most of the interviews, which ranged in length from four minutes to three hours, were recorded – but for others she scribbled notes. If anyone told her to get stuffed and mind her own beeswax, she doesn’t record it here.Her approach isn’t systematic. She organises her material roughly by theme, including chapters dealing with infidelity, the difficulty of defining love, attachment theory (which yields some interesting and suggestive material my “avoidant style”, I now think, is why my wife finds me so annoying), cultural expectations, long-term commitment, breakup and orce, intimate partner violence and bereavement.But Mucha has read and interviewed widely around the subject, too: her discussions are spiked with references to various social and psychological studies, bits of neuroscience and quotes from philosophers and psychologists living and dead. And she has truffled out some intriguing stuff. Did you know, for instance, that heartbreak can actually break your heart? Stress cardiomyopathy, AKA “broken heart syndrome”, is a real medical condition in which extreme emotional stress can change the shape of your left ventricle causing chest pain, breathlessness and the urge to write bad poetry and listen to Cranberries albums.Likewise, but perhaps less surprisingly, the first flush of romantic love pickles our tiny brains in hormones, raising our dopamine, noradrenaline and cortisol levels and lowering our supplies of sensible and calming serotonin. And the association of sexual excitement with fight-or-flight hormones means that you’re far more likely to find someone attractive if you encounter them in a situation of extreme peril such as on a wobbly bridge over a canyon or in the chamber of the House of Commons during a Brexit vote.When all that magic wears off and we’re boredly watching Netflix in our onesies – the time that takes to happen, according to studies, varies from 30 years to 12 months, depending on whether you’re looking at dopamine or serotonin – companionate love gives us vasopressin and oxytocin. Love really is a drug.For the mathematically minded, meanwhile, it turns out that it’s possible to “solve” a speed dating event with the help of something called the Gale-Shapley algorithm – which, in a heterosexual event where the men happen to make the approaches, results in each man getting the most desirable lady he has a hope of snagging, and each woman getting the “least bad” of all the available men. Perhaps let’s not be too mathematically minded. Mucha describes how the economist Peter Backus calculated that there were precisely 26 women in the universe who might be suitable partners for him – meaning, he concluded using another equation, that “there were more intelligent alien civilisations in the galaxy than potential girlfriends for him”. We’ve all been there.In the realm of metaphor rather than brain science, she lights on a wonderful line of Stendhal, likening the smitten stage of early attraction to the crystallisation effect seen in Salzburg’s salt mines: leave a twig in the mines for a few months and it comes out “studded with a galaxy of scintillating diamonds”. The original branch is unrecognisable. Who hasn’t turned round, a year or two into a relationship, to find that their magical diamond wand has turned back into a knobbly old stick?And yet, unless we’re to spend our lives chasing diamond wands, we must learn to cherish our knobbly sticks. Mucha declares in her epilogue that when she began this project “I didn’t know how to love” “Ten years of speaking to strangers, burying myself deep in journals, and speaking to yet more strangers, has changed that.” Love, she concludes unexceptionably, is “one of the greatest joys we can experience as humans” but it takes work. And the work is, as the psychologist Erich Fromm has put it, not “falling in love” but making a conscious decision to “stand in love”.

She talks about happiness, motherhood and her four failed novelsSince finishing her latest novel, Late in the Day, Tessa Hadley has been “in a real panic”. She was worried that the story – about two long-married couples whose seemingly well ordered, beautiful lives become messy after one of the husbands dies – was too sad, “too glum”. “I thought it was going to be a disaster,” she says. But the novel, her seventh, has just received early reviews from the US, including one in the Washington Post that begins by hailing her as “one of the greatest stylists alive”. We meet the evening before she heads off on a two-week US book tour. Many writers would grumble about this as a necessary evil of modern publishing, but Hadley is looking forward to it, especially her shared events with the Irish writer Colm Tóibín, “a genius”, and the New Yorker critic James Wood. The whole thing is “amazing”, she marvels.Success is all the more gratifying to Hadley “because it came later”. After 20 years of struggling to write, Accidents in the Home, her first novel, was published when she was 46. Much has been made of this late start but, as she points out, it’s hardly as if she were Penelope Fitzgerald (who was 61 when her first novel was published). In a long print dress and waistcoat, and with her fine bone structure and expressive manner, Hadley, now in her 60s, could be the elegant, sharply drawn heroine of one of her own books (she is not, she insists, the quietly determined painter Christine in Late in the Day, “but I felt very close to her”). She speaks with the flowing, thoughtful intensity of her prose, and says of the impending tour: “I’ve had my moments of thinking ‘wouldn’t it have been fun to do this in my 30s? Wouldn’t it have been wicked to do this in my 30s!’ But then I wouldn’t change those strange, anonymous, quiet, private years of feeling quite low sometimes because I so longed to write and I couldn’t do it. Feeling like a real person, with friends and family, I wouldn’t lose that, that seems part of everything to me. And,” she reflects, sinking back into the armchair with her glass of wine, “what a nice compensation for growing older. I’m so lucky.”Reviews of Hadley’s work tend to sound like undergraduate reading lists, comparing her to everyone from Elizabeth Bowen to Virginia Woolf. She has a theory that if you mention writers you admire in interviews, your work becomes associated with them, and she is full of recommendations (it’s not often Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert comes up in conversation). She is yet to win one of the big literary prizes, perhaps because she is known for “domestic fiction” and is often seen as Britain’s answer to Alice Munro or Anne Tyler. Late in the Day, with its focus on the enduring conflicts between marriage and freedom (infidelity), motherhood and art, is hallmark Hadley, although, with its serious, questing characters, it is in some ways more akin to the now rather unfashionable novels of Iris Murdoch or Margaret Drabble.With this book, she wanted to write about long marriages, in particular, because “they seem immensely interesting and they are kind of new in a way … people just live so much longer.” She recalls an image from a folktale that appears in the novel of holding on to your lover as he goes through a series of metamorphoses: a fairy, a dragon, a lion. “And it seems to me marriage is a bit like that,” she says. “You either hang on or you don’t.”Hanging on or not is the starting point for much of Hadley’s fiction and she is good on the nagging insistence of desire. “Yeah, I am always writing about the power of that, not in detail, but what a potent thing it is, and yet how hard it still is to talk about.” The sex life of one of the couples in the book, Christine and Alex, “is non-existent and quite inarticulate. You read all those wonderful  advice columns, saying: ‘You must talk to each other’ and they aren’t and actually they can’t,” she says. “There’s something about cohabiting that is a little bit numbing. I have a perfectly happy marriage,” she adds, laughing.As Anne Enright noted years ago, “Hadley, for all the felicity of her prose style, is an immensely subversive writer.” But, set in the comfortable, self‑conscious world of London art dealers, artists and poets, Late in the Day hardly seems radical. In fact, in subject matter, tone and location, it could be described as a Hampstead novel for Fitbit-wearing fiftysomethings.Apart from passing mentions of Facebook or Tinder, her fiction has an Austen-like reticence about external events. But Hadley, like her well-meaning, well-heeled characters, is acutely aware of “this dangerous globalised world”, reading and worrying about it all the time, wondering: “What am I doing wasting my time on this, when the world is going to hell in a handcart?”Her characters, like Chekhov’s, she says, are burdened by conscience and privilege, angsty and guilt-ridden, but impotent to do anything about it. “All a novelist can do is watch the people thinking that.” But instead of the largely upper middle-class groups of the north London novels of yore, she is interested in the overlooked “much-mocked, -reading liberal intelligentsia, who are so characteristic of now, with all their comedy and all their sweetness and goodness”.“Is it drawing to a close, do you think? Our bourgeois sensibility … Our privilege of subtlety and irony is at an end,” one character laments, without irony.“It looks as if we have written about that for ever and ever,” Hadley agrees. “But we haven’t done a catch-up on quite how that feels now.” This, she says, is her true subject: “Not a huge one, but here in this little Britain, now. This class of conscientious, flawed, indulgent but self-searching people that is my generation. It is slightly tragic, no, comic, the helplessness of that conscientiousness,” she says carefully. “It’s a very conscientious moment I think.”Hadley grew up in “a very ordinary bourgeois schoolteacher’s household in Bristol”. But it was a creative one: her father was also a jazz trumpeter and her “stay at home mum” – “a very beautiful, very sexy, very glamorous woman” – was a dressmaker and artist, and her uncle is the playwright Peter Nichols (best known for A Day in the Death of Joe Egg). Although she was “quite clever”, she was “no good at formal education”, and hated her girls’ grammar school in Bristol: “It was like a prison to me ... the most unhappy time of my life.” At 14 she left to join her brother (now an art historian) at the local comprehensive, where she was much happier, and where an English teacher encouraged her to apply to Cambridge. “Did I enjoy it?” she asks herself. “I felt a bit of a fish out of water. It was a club again. I’d been no good at Brownies. I longed to do ballet. I longed to fit in at grammar school, but somehow I’m not good at it. It was fine at Cambridge. But no, I didn’t love it.”After Cambridge, she “had no plan, except to live”. She trained to become a teacher, meeting her future husband, her tutor Eric Hadley, and thereby fulfilling her mother’s prophecy that she would “meet a lovely man, someone older, somebody in authority”. And following a brief spell teaching (“I was hopeless”), she “went off and had babies … What madness. I blame DH Lawrence entirely.” (She is an unashamedly passionate Lawrentian.)Over the next 10 years she had three sons, and three stepsons, who were “ intimately part of our huge family”, and was “busy making a life at home and all of that, like my mother had done”. But she was seized with a “devouring, painful need to write … pushed down with shame when I thought: ‘How dare I think of it.’” Her fervent reading only increased her “hunger to do it”. Once her boys were at school, she tried more seriously, “in secret, not really making too much of it”, finishing four novels. “But my books were no good. That was agony.” She was “trying to write other people’s books in other people’s voices” Bertolt Brecht inspired one, Nadine Gordimer another, “but in all of them I was faking it in every sentence”. She told herself to give up because it was making her so miserable, “but the trouble was, I couldn’t”. After each rejection letter she would immediately start thinking about “the next novel and that I would get this one right”.In desperation, she enrolled in her late 30s on an MA in creative writing, then quite new in the UK, at Bath College of Higher Education, now Bath Spa University, despite her misgivings – “Lawrence and Tolstoy didn’t do an MA course!” And she loved it so much that she stayed on to do her PhD, on Henry James. “I was being my clever self, gradually coming out from disguise,” she says. She has taught creative writing there ever since: “a joy to do”.It was while working at the university that she got a call from her newly acquired agent to say Accidents in the Home had been bought by Jonathan Cape. In a scene that might come from one of her novels, she called her best friend, who said simply, “‘This changes everything.’ And it did!” she says, getting a little weepy.In fact, an excerpt from the novel had already appeared in the New Yorker, “one of the miracles in my life”. She tells a good story of how, some years earlier, she had “made a pilgrimage” from Cardiff, where the family lived, to London to meet an agent who had shown interest in her work. They recommended she try placing some short stories. She naively suggested the New Yorker, where she was reading Gordimer and Munro. “I saw the agent and her assistant just glance at each other. Aaargh!” But she had the last laugh and is now a regular in the magazine. She credits Munro’s stories with giving her “a lovely sense of permission” to write as herself at last and about the world she knew: “I was thinking this is just life. I recognise this, its weave is right, its sensibility.”Today Hadley writes at a small desk in her bedroom in her London flat, having moved from Cardiff once the boys left home. “I do always feel that if I had a beautiful study lined with books, with an exquisite desk and flowers and a view, I would think: ‘Who is that for?’ It would feel fraudulent.” After all those years writing between the school run and doing the laundry, she doesn’t have a strict regime: “The rule is, it’s not a rule, it’s for pleasure, because I want to. So I write any day I can.”One of the most satisfying aspects of Late in the Day for Hadley is the character of Christine, who, when her marriage falls apart, is sustained by her art. “I was thinking about how I feel about work and its importance, and I was pouring that into writing about her and her painting.” She recalls her great heroes, the Elizabeths Bowen and Taylor, who responded to “the gathering despair in western culture” in the mid 20th century “by saying ‘I’m going to go on describing the everyday life of people getting on with love and parenthood and despair, because I’ve only just got this. I’m not going to give it up just out of angst and existential despair.’”So Hadley plans to continue writing about people just getting on with the business of living. She’s already at work on her next novel. “It’s slightly mad. I suppose it is because I started late or something,” she says. “Now I’m loving it, why wouldn’t I do it as much as I can?”• Late in the Day is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

A number of parties are carrying out due diligence before submitting final-round bids. The auction is understood to have attracted a mix of private equity and trade buyers.Costa Coffee – which is now owned by Coca-Cola – plus Caffè Nero and Leon are thought to be interested in parcels of stores, but administrators are hopeful of finding a buyer which will run a significant part of Patisserie Valerie as a going concern. KPMG declined to comment.The original Patisserie Valerie cafe, which has been trading on Old Compton Street in central London since the 1940s, was among the stores that closed and some financial experts had questioned the likelihood of a buyer emerging given the potential irregularities in the accounts.The billionaire missed out this week on the auction of HMV, which was won by Canada’s Sunrise Records. But last week he added the online retailer Sofa to a retail group that now encompasses sportswear, department stores and furniture.“Sports Direct International confirms that it has made an offer to acquire the business comprising the trade and assets of Patisserie Holdings and its group companies out of administration,” the company said.Patisserie Holdings is the parent of Patisserie Valerie as well as the Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker \u0026amp Spice and Flour Power City brands.Analysts suggest Ashley is trying to assemble a portfolio of brands to sell in House of Fraser stores. A number of brands pulled out after losing millions of pounds when the department store chain went bust last year, leaving gaps in its ranges. Patisserie Valerie had been opening cafes in Debenhams but they were among the sites to close last month.Patisserie Valerie was the jewel in the crown of its chairman, the entrepreneur Luke Johnson. But the appointment of administrators last month wiped the value of Johnson’s and all other shareholders’ investment the stock market-listed business, which was valued at £450m before it flagged up the potential fraud in October.Patisserie Valerie’s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested by Hertfordshire police and bailed in October.

A tour of the spellbinding Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year 540, a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas – surely the  columnist of his day – was writing “on the ruin of Britain”. Even before the country properly existed, there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise.Still, that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than 50 days is of epic significance, breaking a thread that has run through our long history. Even in the age of Mercia, the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in “Francia”, Rome and Ireland. The 10th-century court of Æthelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent. And need we mention that the Anglo-Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe? The Faragiste tendency, which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe, imagines a past that did not exist.So there should be no apologies for clanging the church bells and crying havoc at the prospect of Brexit on 29 March. Viewed one way, that date became a tad less scary this week, thanks to Jeremy Corbyn, whose letter to Theresa May, offering Labour approval for an exit path out of the EU via a permanent customs union, makes a no-deal crash-out less likely. For inching us away from that catastrophe, Corbyn deserves credit. On the other hand, for inching us closer to Brexit happening at all, and with Labour’s blessing, he deserves blame.This was May’s game all along: to keep dangling the lunacy of no deal over our heads until an agreed Brexit looked sane by comparison.But it’s not sane. Even the softest, mildest Brexit-with-a-deal represents an act of national folly that would have had Cnut shaking his head in disbelief. Take a look at Labour’s demands – alignment with the single market and on workers’ rights along with a say over EU trade deals – and realise that these are the things we already have under our current deal, namely EU membership. The very best that can be said for Labour’s Brexit is that it will only be much worse than the status quo rather than much, much worse. (Don’t hold your breath to see that line in the next manifesto.)No one can make a positive case for it, listing the concrete benefits it will bring – because it won’t bring any, and certainly not “the exact same benefits” of EU membership that Labour once, delusionally, promised. The government’s own figures show that Brexit in whatever form will make us poorer. (Norway plus would be a less painful Brexit but it would also be a pointless one.) It means pro-Europeans are left banking on May and her party rejecting the Labour offer – fleeing from the customs union proposal because it won’t allow us to make our own trade deals. (As if, solo, post-Brexit Britain will match the clout that saw the EU strike the deal with Japan that came into force this month, creating a massive free trade area that will combine a market of 500 million consumers with the world’s third-biggest economy.)If May does reject the Labour offer of a joint, bipartisan Brexit, pro-Europeans are banking on Corbyn and John McDonnell finally keeping their word and honouring Labour party policy by backing a second referendum. From the start, the people’s vote strategy has been to wait patiently until all other options are exhausted, at which point MPs, out of alternatives and at the very last minute, will realise the train is about to crash and reach for a referendum as the nearest available emergency cord. That strategy has always been high-risk. What if the process of elimination falters and May’s deal squeaks through after all, helped over the line by Labour votes? For the strategy to work, MPs must not only recoil from no deal, but then decide to flee to the safe harbour not of May’s Brexit deal but a public vote. A lot has to go right for all those things to happen.For that reason, I think pro-Europeans now have to make a different move. They can’t wait for the starting gun of a referendum that may or may not ever sound. Nor is it good enough to devote their energies simply to campaigning for such a vote, or to Commons manoeuvres to get one. They need instead to make the anti-Brexit case to the public right now, as if the referendum campaign had already begun. Don’t wait. Put up the posters, book the halls, spend the money right away. Do it now.The reasoning is simple. So far, pro-Europeans have emphasised the means – a second referendum – over the ends: staying in the EU. That’s the wrong way around. The first task is to persuade the public that Brexit has to be stopped: that leaving the EU will bring ruin, while staying in and making it better is the confident, open, patriotic choice. Only when voters feel that stopping Brexit on 29 March is an urgent priority will they then demand that their MPs find a way to do it, turning to a second referendum as the obvious democratic means. There is a way, but first there must be the will.“We’ve been far too up our parliamentary arses,” admits one people’s vote strategist, promising that the battle will now move to street level, with another mass demonstration on the way. He admits that they’ve paid too much attention to Westminster, which is the weather, rather than building public opposition to Brexit, which is the climate.So start the campaign now. And as pro-Europeans make their case, they need to be mindful that economic catastrophism – even the sincere warnings of medicine shortages and actual corporate decisions to relocate jobs – is not cutting through. As Gary Younge wrote on these pages last week, remain needs to tell a story that goes beyond economics and speaks to national pride.As it happens, such a narrative is there, ready to be told. It is the story of a nation that has always been plural, hybrid, forged of many tribes of a confident people who have reached across the seas to touch their closest neighbours, and who have never feared any kind of international club or alliance, because they had the confidence, even the swagger, to know they did not just belong in such a grouping, they could help shape it.Our ancestors would not recognise today’s Brexiters, so cowed and lacking in courage that they fear they can’t cut it at the top table, sitting as equals alongside France and Germany, but must hide instead in the corner, on their own. The nation whose earliest works are now on display at the British Library would see the European Union and know in an instant that its place was at the heart of it.So we do have a story to tell. But let’s not wait for May’s permission to tell it. There are fewer than 50 days to avert what will be one of the gravest errors in our long history. There is not a moment to waste."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36868f494e35f6e23d34dfa1fbfb59041b7a520b/0_13_2323_1392/master/2323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44988e467caddda58696cde966102ee0","title":"blackface ralph northam history","story":"The growing political scandal in Virginia forces us to look at the legacy of blackface and ask: why is it so enduring?“America is a land of masking jokers,” the novelist Ralph Ellison wrote in 1958 in an essay on American identity. “We wear the mask for purposes of aggression as well as for defense, when we are projecting the future and preserving the past … the joke is at the center of the American identity.”At the height of its popularity in the late 19th century, seeing white performers adorned in coal-black makeup, woolly wigs and outlandishly red lips was one of the most beloved pastimes for white American families. As an image, the iconography of blackface dates back centuries, appearing in colonial-era illustrations of black Africans. These images sought to portray black people as clowns and freakish beings, exaggerating features so as to suggest the “otherness” of black bodies. In the 1830s, however, blackface took off in its most recognizable form today, when it was integrated into onstage performances by white Americans who donned dark makeup, red lips and rough curly wigs, the blackness of their makeup amplifying the whiteness of their eyes and teeth.The performances began in a number of north-eastern states. They often featured singing, dancing, skits and instrumental music, the latter often some form of “Negro melodies”. Blackface shows were marketed as a peculiar mix of high- and lowbrow entertainment they were bawdy and crude, planting, in this way, the seed of vaudeville, but they also attempted to translate more elitist forms of art, such as opera, to a popular stage. The segregationist Jim Crow laws took their name from a minstrelsy act, Jumping Jim Crow, by blackface showboat Thomas Dartmouth Rice – sometimes considered “the father” of minstrel performance – who claimed it was based on a slave he knew.So lucrative was blackface that even African American performers had little choice but to wear it if they desired a modicum of success with white audiences. Such was the case with one of the most famous black stage actors of the  19th century, William Henry Lane – better known as “Master Juba” – who was forced to wear blackface until he became sufficiently famous around the globe to travel, sans blackface, with a troupe of white actors. Lane astonished audiences, dancing a modified Irish jig and reel set to syncopated African rhythms, which laid the foundations for tap dancing. He was a prodigy, dancing in public from age 10 in the mid-1830s. Yet he had to humiliate himself in order to proceed he had to, as a foundation, exist as a carnivalesque gag onstage, so that his white viewers might, after a hearty laugh and jeer, have a chance of noticing the extraordinary movements of his feet. In this way, blackface was a demeaning vehicle to success, a prerequisite for achieving posterity well into the early 20th century.Blackface occasionally appeared as a peculiar form of part-mocking homage, and perhaps the clearest example of this is in a remarkable 1932 episode of Betty Boop, I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead You Rascal You, which featured Louis Armstrong and his band. The cartoon begins with Armstrong and crew providing background music for Betty Boop, Bimbo and Koko the Clown’s safari into a vast jungle the troop is unceremoniously attacked by swarthy, grotesque-faced cannibals, who kidnap Betty Boop and prepare to cook her.In what must rank as one of the most blatantly racist scenes in popular cartoon history, the episode cuts to Betty Boop’s sidekicks being chased by the floating head of an animated thick-lipped caricature indistinguishable from the iconography of minstrel shows, which morphs into Armstrong’s own gigantic, floating face, then back into the cannibal’s visage. To be sure, such racist imagery was common in early American cartoons, the origins of which are intimately tied to minstrelsy and vaudeville. Mickey Mouse, Bimbo and Koko may even be imagined as minstrels themselves, as the critic Nicholas Sammond has argued, their earliest onscreen performances often echoing the dance routines and musical numbers of minstrel shows. Against mounting criticism from civil rights groups, such blatant racism in public works steadily evanesced, fading, instead, into the background – no longer as obvious as Armstrong’s transforming face, but still there, for those who looked.When a 1984 yearbook photo of Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, surfaced of a man in blackface and one in Ku Klux Klan robes, Northam claimed he did not remember being in the photo, but admitted he had darkened his face the same year to dress as Michael Jackson for a “dance contest in San Antonio”. It was a homage, he implied. “In the place and time where I grew up,” Northam said during a press conference, “many actions that we rightfully recognize as abhorrent today were commonplace.” Northam seemed to believe that the “commonplace” nature of racism absolved him – but, of course, it does not, cannot. Incredibly, the Virginia attorney general soon revealed that he, too, had worn blackface in the past. None of this was new in politics the Missouri Democratic governor Mel Carnahan still won a 2000 Senate seat after a photograph surfaced of him singing in a blackface quartet.The fact is that blackface has never left America it has simply become less overt. It appears whenever other racist symbols do: the noose, the watermelon, the assumptions that black bodies are dangerous bodies, that one should cross the road when a black body walks towards you, day or night. It haunts us like some grotesque ghost, grinning and laughing, and hoping a certain kind of white audience still sees it, still laughs at it, still feels comforted, even, by it.It still appears in countless ways: the exaggerated features on Aunt Jemimah the seemingly unending stream of college students caught on camera with faces painted black the minstrel-era features of Japanese anime and manga characters,  such as Mr Popo, who are popular in the United States the caricatured effigies of Barack Obama that conservatives have erected, year after year, to shoot, lynch or even detonate on camera. Blackface is a protean, all-encompassing form, indelibly interwoven into this country’s psyche, its images of red lips suggesting both eroticism – harkening to colonial-era stereotypes, still extant, about the “heightened” sexuality of black bodies – and blood, the blood of the black corpses that fills America’s soils. Its act still plays out on the stage of America today.Blackface is the joke that comforts white Americans who, consciously or otherwise, are terrified of nonwhite people, as Ellison knew. It lives on like a comfort food. The critic Elias Cannetti argued, in Crowds and Power, that laughter allows us to take power over the one we laugh at perhaps this is why, even now, blackface still exists, a crude, cruel attempt by certain white Americans to retain a sense of racial superiority. Blackface is a ghost we may never be able to exorcise it is too deeply, painfully American."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee271862176a017b2b8469a139338e54193bb29/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6afda3e3a03e6413a40234d2a26b0ad5","title":"theresa may england maidenhead brexit","story":"A river runs through it, and so does the chablis – but Maidenhead is a town of submerged currentsPeople make the journey to Maidenhead for different reasons. Fiction offers contrasting examples. George Harvey Bone, the tortured soul at the heart of Patrick Hamilton’s novel Hangover Square, reached the town just after war broke out in 1939, after walking all the way from Earl’s Court and the bodies of the couple he’d killed the previous morning. To him, the word Maidenhead meant past innocence and future salvation. He imagined he would find “peace, the river, an inn, a quiet glass of beer, and safety, utter safety …” Ascoyne d’Ascoyne in the film Kind Hearts and Coronets, on the other hand, went there for something livelier: to spend a weekend with his mistress at a Thames-side hotel, which was the fashion among the louche and wealthy in the Edwardian days when Maidenhead’s reputation came second only to Brighton’s as the raciest town in England.Both men promptly died there – Bone by sticking his head over a gas ring, D’Ascoyne when his punt tipped over a weir (no accident). The visitor to Maidenhead can walk down to the riverside and see the spot where the episode in that most perfect of Ealing comedies was shot. In life, it was the old Guards Club, where the officers from the brigade’s barracks at Pirbright and Windsor would come to dance, swim and row, and befriend the chorus girls who lived across the river in the so-called Gaiety houses that took their name from the London music hall. In the film, the club grounds become a hotel garden where Alec Guinness as the arrogant D’Ascoyne is solicitously pouring champagne for his lover – unaware that life, like a weekend, is short.I sat on a bench there on Wednesday and looked at the rowers slicing through the current. This was the pleasant side of Maidenhead: black-and-white, neo-Jacobean villas with cupolas and turrets boathouses willows. Upstream lay Cookham and Marlow and downstream Bray and Windsor – placenames associated with monarchs, Michelin-starred restaurants and popular entertainers who are variously dead or alive or released on licence: Diana Dors, Ernie Wise, Michael Parkinson, Rolf Harris.The comic novelist John O’Farrell, who grew up in Maidenhead (and in 2001 stood as the constituency’s Labour candidate), once characterised this stretch of the Thames Valley as “Tory since the Bronze Age”, a corner of Middle England with inhabitants who “somehow give the impression of having been nouveau riche for 10 successive generations”. That may be accurate so far as it goes, but it misses Maidenhead’s position at the centre of English life. From a riverside bench in Maidenhead you can see plane after plane climb into the air from Heathrow, and new Japanese trains whiz to and from Paddington over Brunel’s bridge – the same bridge that Turner painted in Rain, Steam and Speed. And since 2016, to complete this overcrowded picture of England in miniature, past and present, Maidenhead’s MP has also been the UK’s prime minister.The town, as opposed to its almost-suburb on the riverbank, is rather ugly. It grew up around the railway station in the 19th century and has been badly knocked about by property developers over the past 60 years, so that its centre holds chastening examples of every architectural fashion since the 1950s. A few remnants of an earlier time persist. A plaque at the little stadium of Maidenhead United FC, for example, records that it first saw a football match on 16 February 1871, making it the world’s “oldest senior football ground continuously used by the same club”. An isolated terrace of tall houses in brown Victorian brick awaits demolition nearby, its corner pub closed and every window boarded. These were homes for a working class in the small towns of southern England that popular history tends to forget.Theresa May’s parents came from this class. According to Rosa Prince’s biography of May, both of her grandmothers were domestic servants a great-grandfather was a butler other ancestors included carpenters, dressmakers and soldiers of no rank higher than sergeant major. By the early years of the last century, most of them had left rural cottages in Surrey and Devon for workaday homes near London. Her mother grew up in a terrace house in Reading with an outside lavatory at the back and a view of tram tracks from the front. It was her father’s occupation as vicar that gave the family a different view of themselves or who they might become.May won Maidenhead for the first time in 1997 and since then has increased her share of the vote from roughly half to roughly two-thirds. She seems well liked. People speak admiringly of the time she gives to her constituency “when she has all this other stuff to worry about”. They like her sense of duty, but then she likes that about herself too: “I grew up the daughter of a local vicar and the granddaughter of a regimental sergeant major. Public service has been part of who I am for as long as I can remember.”The chair of the town’s Conservative Association, Councillor Richard Kellaway, voted remain partly for the interesting reason that in his work as an oil industry consultant he had always found Brussels easier to deal with than Whitehall. When I asked him if Brexit had caused isions in the local party, he said that “by and large” it stood right behind her: there had been “no ferment”. He was a friendly, steady kind of man as was Pat McDonald, parish councillor and Labour candidate at the last general election.The fact is that nothing very bad has happened in Maidenhead, outside the exercise of personal appetites. The place to satisfy them used to be Skindles, a riverside hotel that began life as a coaching inn and later became notorious as a leading home counties venue for adultery. It was demolished in 2015 and replaced by expensive houses and a brasserie, Roux at Skindles – where for lunch, in a vague attempt to revive the Edwardian spirit, I decided to have a bowl of fish soup and a glass of the house champagne.They came. I ate. “If we don’t like the chablis we’ll just throw it away,” said an animated, silver-haired man to a waiter at an adjacent table, sounding as if he owned the place, which he did. Reviving the Edwardian spirit even further, I had my card delivered to his table with a note. “Dear M Roux, I wonder if you could spare two minutes for …” He came over, which was good of him. I wanted to ask where he stood on Brexit. “My opinion changes every five minutes,” he said, “but whatever we do, deal or no deal, in five years we’ll be laughing.”It was reassuring. Look out in 2024 for those Roux branches opening in Sunderland and Stoke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea512a7e7029f1997e126293d84e25758044f5c0/0_582_2120_1272/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f31594a540ad4685882f25ba5422e1f","title":"on my radar mary mccartney","story":"The photographer on her favourite park walks, an insightful pop documentary and a handy film-making appBorn in London in 1969 to Paul and Linda McCartney, Mary McCartney followed in her mother’s footsteps and became a professional photographer in 1992. She has published three vegetarian cookbooks and a number of photography books, including From Where I Stand (2010) and Monochrome \u0026amp Colour (2014). McCartney’s latest book, Paris Nude (Heni), a record of two days spent at the home of New York-born, Paris-based comedian Phyllis Wang, is out now.I’ve always loved MIA’s music, but didn’t know much about her background. The documentary shows her life, her art and political leanings – it has footage from when she was at college up until now. I didn’t know she’d started out as an artist and film-maker. It’s particularly poignant when she goes back to Sri Lanka and is playing with the kids in her grandmother’s house it showed her human side rather than just her up on stage. I thought it was very intelligently put together.I like to put this on if I’m on the tube, travelling or walking in the park – I’ll catch up on things. They have everything, from Steve Carell talking about his latest film to discussions of the Costa book prize or the latest Bridget Riley exhibition and the Oscar nominations, which was really interesting. That’s why I like it – it’s the variety. It keeps you up on books, exhibitions and movies. It crosses the range of my interests and keeps me a bit more involved in areas I wouldn’t usually spend time on otherwise.I love that you can get lost in the V\u0026ampA. It has so many galleries: miniatures, silver collections, amazing sculptures, marbles. It has two new rooms devoted to historic and modern photography, so I’ve been spending more time there. They have very early processed sun prints and work by lots of different photographers including Cindy Sherman and Lee Miller. They also have a selection of my own and my mum’s photography, which is exciting. It’s quite special for a museum to make two of its rooms permanent photography galleries.I do some directing as well as photography. Everyone is always on their phones these days, so I downloaded this app, which has video settings for playing around with the shutter speed, make things lighter and darker with the aperture or make it slower, at 50 frames per second, and things like that. It takes a little while to get used to. But if I’ve got a camera on me and I want to film something quickly, this is a bit of kit to have in your phone that allows you to do more cinematographer-type effects.I love this London park. It has the playing fields, which are a great big, wide open space, and then in the inner circle it has this much more planted and manicured area, which in the summer is an amazing rose garden. You can wander through so many different spaces – the boating area, the Open Air theatre, the bandstand – and there’s even an area that has allotments in it. I go to this park any time I can sneak away. I’m probably more of a morning person, but it’s great at any time. And I love going on the little boats in the summer.This is somewhere I’ve gone to a lot over the years. It’s in the heart of London’s Soho, which I love, and it’s a major institution, with so much history and such a range of people playing there. Last year, I saw the Last Poets perform and Ruby Turner, who plays with Jools Holland, performed there recently. It’s got an intimacy to it I really like: you go in and it’s got low lighting, little seats and red lamps on the tables and the upstairs lounge area is really cool. It’s a great venue to go to if you want to have a good night out. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He talks to playwright  Roy Williams about his sky-high hopes for the next generation“So, you saw the film?” Barry Jenkins is eager to ask the minute we are introduced. He gives good eye contact through those stylish thick-rimmed glasses – not the big-time, Oscar-winning writer-director speaking, but a nervous artist, anxious about the new work he is starting to screen. I love it, I tell him. If Beale Street Could Talk may be only Jenkins’ third feature-length film, but it has already been nominated for three Oscars (best adapted screenplay, best supporting actress, best score), just two years after his Moonlight walked away with the Academy Award for best film. A passionate film about race and love, it’s an added pleasure to see black characters of such complexity on the big screen. British film industry, kindly take note.Adapted from James Baldwin’s 1974 novel, Beale Street tells the story of a young black couple in 1970s Harlem. When Tish (KiKi Layne) becomes pregnant, they plan to marry – until her fiance Fonny (Stephan James) is set up by a racist police officer for a rape he did not commit. The film explores the different reactions of their siblings and parents, led by Regina King in a standout performance as Tish’s mother, as they fight for Fonny’s freedom.Baldwin has been dead for 30 years, but his depiction of the fight against a country’s powerful prejudice is a sad reminder that not enough has changed, that Black Lives Still Matter. Yet Jenkins turns a bleak story into a compelling romance, as the young lovers strive to be regarded as human beings. With its lingering, saturated-colour photography – the director has cited Wong Kar-Wai’s In The Mood For Love as an influence – Beale Street is one of the most visually arresting films I’ve seen.“That was kind of our intention,” says Jenkins, who also wrote the screenplay. “We thought, ‘How cool would it be, to have this absolutely ravishingly gorgeous depiction of black romance, just pure and lush and vibrant – but then really lean into the systemic injustice issues that Baldwin’s talking about – with a very angry, almost bitter voice?’”Beale Street was filmed on location in New York and the Dominican Republic – filling in for Puerto Rico, still devastated by 2017’s Hurricane Maria. It was shot on an Arri Alexa 65 camera, Jenkins tells me (he’s a little bit geeky like this: taking joy in the details of the craft), because “it is the best digital camera for portraiture”. Throughout the film, as he did in Moonlight, the director lingers over often wordless scenes between his characters, presenting them as a series of moving photographs.I tell him that if Moonlight didn’t finally kill off the ugly argument (and I have heard it, from producers and directors alike) that you can’t film black people because they’re just too dark, then Beale Street surely will. “My cinematographer is a white guy, actually,” Jenkins points out, referring to James Laxton, who also worked with him on Moonlight. “We both prioritise exactly what you’re talking about. Every day we’re on set and we’re in colour correction. And it’s always, ‘But how was the skin? What are we doing to protect the skin?’ Not even protect: ‘What are we doing to properly calibrate what we’re doing for the skin?’”While Jenkins’ film largely honours Baldwin’s novel, the director has added a new ending that follows the original – giving the audience just a glimpse of hope. Even so, he is convinced he has remained faithful to the book’s central message. Which is? “I think it would be: ‘We are not broken. You cannot break us.’ I wanted to show that, even in the most devastating circumstance, the family unit had not been broken.”He wrote the script almost simultaneously with that for Moonlight, on a trip to Europe in the summer of 2013. Jenkins bought a return ticket to Brussels, booked into an Airbnb for two weeks, and first – because adapting Baldwin looked too daunting to kick off with – started on Moonlight. “I thought, ‘I’ll just get my legs’, because I hadn’t written anything in a while. And then I’ll switch to Beale Street.” When the Moonlight script came together in 10 days, he travelled to Berlin for fresh inspiration, writing Beale Street over the next four weeks – an intensely productive period.“I’ve never had that happen again in my life. I’ve tried to replicate it, and I think the reason it worked was because, as a human being, I ceased to exist. I didn’t have any friends, I didn’t have a cell phone, I didn’t know anyone, I had no family. It was just the bartenders who were helping me, giving me caffeine or alcohol.”Jenkins came to Baldwin as an adult. “I didn’t grow up as a voracious reader. James Baldwin was recommended to me by a girlfriend, who was a little older than me, more mature, worldlier, smarter, more attractive,” he says, with a laugh. “And she, in breaking up with me, recommended – so I could grow up – that I read James Baldwin: ‘I’m done with you, but I’m going to give you a hint. You need to read James Baldwin.’ She recommended Giovanni’s Room and The Fire Next Time. That was how my love affair began.”Jenkins is currently working on another adaptation, of the Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead. It is the story of two slaves who escape southern plantations through a network of safe houses and secret tunnels to reach the northern states, where they will be free. Working with a team of screenwriters, Jenkins will direct a 10-hour TV series for Amazon.Moonlight was based on McCraney’s semi-autobiographical play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, about a tough childhood with a drug-addicted mother, and a painful coming out. Both McCraney and Jenkins grew up in the predominantly black, working-class Miami neighbourhood of Liberty City, attending the same high school (Jenkins is a year older). “We never knew each other,” the director says. “This is sad to say, but I might not have been brave enough to have been Tarell’s friend when we were kids. I feel like Tarell was always proud to be who he was, and was likely ostracised for it. I was more a follower than a leader, you know, when I was that age.”Like McCraney, Jenkins’ mother was an addict, and he was raised by a family friend, his father having died when he was 12. Two years ago, the director told the : “There were seven or eight of us in a two-bed apartment. There was usually food, but sometimes not.”Which films inspired him, growing up? “I wasn’t really inspired by film,” he says, “but I admired Spike Lee’s movies because they just felt very, very, very black. I remember watching School Daze and thinking, ‘What the hell is this?’ There were colleges for black people that just black people go to? And those colleges had all this shit going on? This is so energising!“Otherwise, it was the really big Hollywood stuff – The Color Purple, Aliens, Die Hard, Coming To America. I would catch the bus to go to the AMC theatre downtown. But I never thought, ‘Hey, maybe one day I might like to do that.’ It just didn’t seem possible.”Winning an Academy Award for best picture must have felt even more farfetched. He grins when I bring up one of the most rollercoaster nights in Oscar history. How did he feel when Damien Chazelle’s widely tipped La La Land was announced the winner of the best picture Oscar in 2017, before the error was corrected?Given the #OscarsSoWhite furore of the previous year (when there was not a single actor or director of colour among 25 nominees), there must have been air punches around the globe when Moonlight belatedly scooped the prize. “I have no doubt that the OscarsSoWhite thing played a role in Moonlight’s success,” Jenkins says. “But when it becomes, ‘Oh, Moonlight only won because of OscarsSoWhite,’ I’m like, ‘Well, say a film won the top award from this critics’ body, then that same film was the highest-rated film on this website, then it goes on to have one of the 10 highest ratings on Metacritic in the history of the website – if I told you that same film won best picture, you wouldn’t question it. But if I told you a black film about a gay black boy whose mom is addicted to crack-cocaine won best picture, then you go, “Oh, it only won because of ersity,’” he laughs.A new renaissance in black film-making is declared every few years, but this time it feels there’s some truth and momentum to it. As well as Jenkins, in the US there is Ryan Coogler, who directed Black Panther and is working on a sequel Spike Lee (nominated for his first Oscar last month, for BlacKkKlansman) Training Day director Antoine Fuqua Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle In Time) and Jordan Peele (Get Out and the upcoming Us).“I think there’s something about the present moment that is collectively inspiring,” Jenkins says. “I don’t think any one of us sees the success of another and feels anything but joy and pride. And I can see that the generation behind us, they see that, and they feed off it.He points to technology as another democratising force. “You see more people from backgrounds that are way outside the core centre, which has always been hetero white American men in the Hollywood system. You can go to any film festival in the world right now, and there are so many people just – not waiting, because waiting’s the wrong word, but who are going to get put on one way or the other. And your ass is going to get left behind if you’re not hiring these people.” Dear British film industry, again, please take note.I tell Jenkins I look forward to the day when the list of British black film-makers who have been entrusted to make hits is as long as the American one. But the director says he has always admired the European system of financing films. “Here are the funds: you don’t have to really worry about the commercial prospects because it’s not private money, it’s public money, and so it’s just about the art. Stateside, it’s almost impossible to raise the funds to make a movie like Steve McQueen’s Hunger, and to make it in that style.”Even so, I say, the US seems more awake to the talents of a generation of British actors and film-makers: Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Amma Asante, John Boyega, Aml Ameen, Naomie Harris – all of whom have followed the likes of Idris Elba to work Stateside, and who can blame them? How many more times can they play a stabbing victim on Casualty? But Jenkins doesn’t want to overstate the opportunities the US has to offer, especially now. “We were moving in this direction where we were trying to eradicate borders, and now we’re trying to build them again,” he says. “I have to think about how we went from the election of Barack Obama to the election of a reality TV star with a heinous past. There were many millions of people who voted for this guy, and I’m trying to understand why that is. What was it about the present moment that made them feel, ‘This is a direction I don’t want the country to go in? This is the direction I want the country to go in.’ Borders and lies and fake this and xenophobic that.” He sighs.Instead, Jenkins thinks there are reasons to be positive about black British culture right now – and that a change is coming soon. He gives an example. Just over a year ago, he was in London and looking for a quiet place to write. He went to Soho House and, spotting Daniel Kaluuya in a corner, went over to say hello before starting work. “I was there writing for four or five hours, and there were all these young black men who just kept coming in and sitting down with Daniel. I recognised one of them, Kibwe Tavares, who directed Jonah, which Daniel starred in. This was at the height of Get Out and Daniel was having all these meetings with young black UK directors. And just from watching the demeanour of it, I could tell he was like, ‘What are you working on? What’s going on? How can we build?’ And so, this shit’s going to happen. It’s going to happen.”• If Beale Street Could Talk is out now.

Everything is decidedly Not Awesome now that the nimbly assembled Lego town of Bricksburg has been transformed into the “heckish” Apocalypseburg, after being invaded by adorable, oversize Duplo bricks. Grenades take the form of smiling love hearts that explode into pixelated pink clouds, while deadly yellow stars seem to borrow the face and pitch of Pokémon’s Pikachu.When wholesome hero Emmet (Chris Pratt) has a dystopian vision of the future that sees the gang banished to the Bin of Storage (“storage” pretentiously pronounced “store-ahge”), he, Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett) and co venture to the Duplo universe in order to stop their maybe evil queen, Watevra Wa’Nabi (a throaty, effortlessly funny Tiffany Haddish). “My plans are totally sinister... I mean sincere,” she chuckles, beguiling perpetual bat-chelor Batman into proposing to her.After some resistance (expressed musically by way of a slinking pop song in which she insists “rich boys with gadgets” are simply “not my type”), arrangements are made for an extravagant, candy-coloured wedding. Meanwhile, Emmet meets the id to his ego in the form of stubbly, blue-vested dinosaur wrangler Rex Dangervest(also voiced by Pratt).The final set piece is a little protracted, but the jokes are mostly sharp and enjoyably self-referential and the songs still catchy (one track is titled Catchy Song). Its placid moral message, of harmony between worlds (and, in the live-action sequences that open and close the film, siblings) is more earnest, but no matter when the animation itself is so thrillingly detailed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Leave to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until ready to use.For the royal icing, you would ideally have a stand mixer with a whisk attachment or, failing that, a hand whisk. Put the egg whites in a bowl and, on a medium speed, whisk until frothy. Add the icing sugar a spoonful at a time, and turn the speed to medium-high. Add the lemon juice and glycerine, and whisk to stiff peaks – it should have a cloudy, glossy consistency.Divide the royal icing equally between two bowls. Colour each one with a different coloured food gel – pick any of your choice (I like pink and yellow!)Add a little water to each bowl if the royal icing seems a little stiff.To assemble, whip the white chocolate filling to a piping consistency. Flip half the biscuits face down and leave half as they are. Spread a good amount of the filling on the undersides, then sandwich with the other halves. The outside of each sandwich should be the ‘face up’ side of the halves. Now, pop the royal icing into two separate bags with thin-tipped piping nozzles, and decorate as you please.

Manchester United did not have to be at their dashing best to continue their stunning resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskjær, but they still could have scored a hatful as they regained a spot in the top four for the first time since the opening weekend of the season.They settled for three in the end and Solskjær was able to keep Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard on the bench before United welcome PSG to Old Trafford for the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie on Tuesday night. A brace from Paul Pogba and a sensational solo goal from Anthony Martial were enough for the Premier League’s form side, who have picked up 25 points from nine games since replacing José Mourinho with Solskjær in December.While United’s supporters revelled in watching the legendary figure in the dugout mastermind another victory, Fulham’s fans booed Claudio Ranieri down the tunnel after the final whistle. The atmosphere in the stands was mutinous and the odds are against the team with the worst defensive record in the ision pulling off a miraculous escape given that they are seven points adrift of 17th place with 12 games remaining.Craven Cottage, normally such a genteel place to watch a game of football, was an angry place when Ranieri replaced André Schürrle with Cyrus Christie in the 53rd minute. The locals were aggrieved to see two of their favourites, Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney, kicking their heels on the bench until deep into the second half and made their feelings clear, aiming loud chants of: “You don’t know what you’re doing” at a manager who appears to have run out of ideas after three months in the job.The frustration for Fulham was they could have been ahead by the time United took the lead with their first shot, only for Luciano Vietto to waste a glorious opportunity inside the first minute, scuffing wide at the far post after being picked out by Schürrle.A strong wind was making the ball move weirdly in the air and it took United a while to adjust in challenging conditions. Not too long, though, given they began to look threatening once Pogba decided it was time to take charge in midfield. The Frenchman’s authority on the ball settled his teammates and it soon became clear United had a plan to get Martial running at Denis Odoi on the left.Pogba has been directly involved in 13 goals in the league since Solskjær’s appointment, scoring eight and creating five, and he eased United ahead with a powerful strike in the 14th minute. Ander Herrera stepped in to win possession with a firm challenge in midfield and Fulham were behind before they had time to react to the danger. Martial’s pass released Pogba and, although the angle looked uninviting, the midfielder’s decision to lash a rising drive towards Sergio Rico’s near post paid off.Rico had leaned to his left in anticipation of a cross, leaving him unable to shift his weight in time to repel Pogba’s powerful shot, and the goalkeeper’s error sapped Fulham’s belief.In the 23rd minute Martial produced a moment of magic in keeping with United’s scintillating counterattacking traditions. The winger started his run just inside his own half after receiving a pass from Phil Jones and there was no catching him as he ignored Odoi’s attempts to bring him down, shimmied past Maxime Le Marchand and opened up his body to curl a lovely shot into the far corner.From there it was a question of how many United could score. They added another when strong work from Romelu Lukaku led to Le Marchand bringing down Juan Mata just inside Fulham’s area.Pogba dispatched his penalty with aplomb and United spent the final 25 minutes keeping their powder dry for PSG."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b517b0044e0b3e98e2f698140d8e75fb54b65a0/0_86_1676_1006/master/1676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4631a1383073617a0609974a1acc1b33","title":"paul lambert ipswich town norwich city","story":"Ipswich Town’s manager is under no illusions as he returns to Carrow Road to face his former chargesThis seems an appropriate time for Paul Lambert to be talking about self‑confidence. He is sitting in his office at Ipswich’s training ground and remembering how not even an uncompromising apprenticeship in Glasgow could prepare him for what he faced when, in 1996, he entered a “hard as nails” dressing room at Borussia Dortmund.“Before I went there I wasn’t as strong as I am now,” he says. “It changed my entire outlook. Big, big players and I became one of them.”He reels off a list from the squad with which he won the 1997 Champions League: Möller, Riedle, Sammer, Chapuisat, Sousa, Kohler. “I’m pretty sure that if you ask anyone how vital I was to them, they’d say I was really important. I won things there and it made me so unbelievably focused and self‑confident. Never arrogant. I know the standards, I know the situations that happen, I know how to handle atmospheres or people criticising me. It’s no problem.”That rhino hide was developed for situations like the one he will face on Sunday lunchtime. Eight years ago, Lambert had Carrow Road under his spell Norwich would achieve a second consecutive promotion in 2010-11, the middle of his three seasons in charge, and would win their derby fixtures by an aggregate of 9-2. The possibilities seemed endless: it was just that, among them, nobody considered he might one day walk into the same arena, braced for dog’s abuse, to manage an Ipswich team adrift at the bottom of the Championship.“I thrive on the pressure,” he says. “I love it. I love the fear factor that goes with it. Perhaps it’s strange, but that’s just me.”East Anglia’s blue section is feeling the fear. A precis of Ipswich’s last decade is that the club fell asleep on the job and Sunday’s scenario, facing rivals who look destined for promotion, is a stark consequence. It raises the question of what Lambert, hardly unemployable after a decent fist at escaping relegation from last season’s top-flight with Stoke, was thinking when he picked up the pieces of Paul Hurst’s short-lived reign in October.“This year I’m 50 and I think what I had to do …” He tails off, before pointing out that he has not overseen a pre-season since 2014-15, his final campaign at Aston Villa. “You look at that, you can’t keep doing it,” he says. He wanted to settle into a project and escape the unwelcome perception of a firefighter, a short-term gun for hire, that had formed after brief spells at Blackburn, Wolves and Stoke.Ipswich’s owner, Marcus Evans, offered Lambert that chance to get his feet under the table. He sees vast potential beyond the league position and spots a chance to correct some of his own mistakes. Lambert felt drained by the straitened circumstances he had faced at Villa. He felt he had taken on too much and, upon leaving, told himself: “I’m not going through all that again I’m going to change.” He toured Europe on a break that, he says, “taught me to live and laugh again”, visiting Barcelona and Real Madrid while calling in favours from a string of Bundesliga contacts.One of them, the then Bayer Leverkusen manager, Roger Schmidt, asked him why he had frequently changed system as Villa slid down the table. “I was just trying to get a result,” Lambert told his friend. “You’ll confuse the players,” Schmidt told him. “I’d been confusing myself with the systems. Back three, four, five, two in the middle, three, couldn’t get the result,” Lambert says. “He was right. I decided I wasn’t going to waver from that advice.”Lambert’s departure from Norwich for Villa in June 2012, after City had finished 12th in the Premier League, was acrimonious and resulted in a legal dispute that lasted six months. On his returns with Villa, the home support rarely spared him their feelings.It seems an unnatural situation for somebody who is written into the club’s hall of fame. “Because of what’s happened there, the feeling is not normal, not normal.”He describes his situation at Ipswich as not normal too. There was the risk that, at a club he felt was “so down, so detached from the town” when he arrived, his past might stretch tolerance levels further. Within days he set to work on its core: the training ground was opened to club legends such as George Burley, John Wark and Terry Butcher, who had been allowed to drift away he has initiated meetings with Blue Action, a supporters’ group last month he funded 50 fans’ travel to Blackburn. The football has been slicker, if not yet persuasive of a miracle escape, but he has succeeded in one sense already: it does not feel, beneath the bonnet, like a club facing the abyss.“It’s a huge club but it was drifting: no enthusiasm, no urgency, an acceptance. The supporters didn’t like the team the team perhaps didn’t like to play in front of them. But I felt that if you can galvanise this place, whatever ision it’s in, it will be unbelievable. This could be anything it wants to be, really.”Ipswich want to remain a Championship club but Lambert says he is committed regardless of this season’s fate. “There’s so much good here if we grab it and all drive the same way.”Many of Lambert’s former players speak reverentially about an uncanny ability to bring people with him. After 50 minutes in his company you understand why: anyone ignorant of the context would leave persuaded that Ipswich, not Norwich, had the wind in their sails going into the derby. That self‑confidence, honed in the Ruhr, is never far from the surface.“The game can be a catalyst and then this place will be moving,” he says. “I know how difficult it is. Norwich have made great strides and we’re playing catch-up. But at the end of the day it’s a football match and we’re going there to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfdb8fb2889862b91ad37a36de0c3249d4493ea2/0_33_2442_1465/master/2442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c4d46736d03b8c5b7c0803914af06ee","title":"ashley cole sets record straight england golden generation","story":"Derby County’s new left-back spoke well on television and refused to indulge the idea that England of 2002-06 should have won at least one major tournamentIt was fun to see Ashley Cole on Sky Sports on Monday Night Football. There wasn’t any obvious peg for having Cole on the show, no link to either of the clubs playing that night. But he was an excellent and engrossing guest after a nervous start, standing very still behind the lighted plinth in his skinny black tie and black suit, looking like a handsome celebrity undertaker.Part of the fascination of Cole is that he has a rare kind of distance around him, the authority of a man who has shunned public appearances to the extent it is a surprise to remember what his voice sounds like.It is no mystery why Cole doesn’t like to speak to the media, which for years advertised an image of him as a cash-grasping numbskull, semi-feral spiv and all-round celebrity sex maniac. Now at Derby County and aged 38, he came cross as a thoughtful, generous understandably guarded kind of person.Invited to muse on which of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi was better Cole just said: “Messi. To mark him was an honour. He was … too good for me.” Asked to settle public scores with the British media he replied, without any bitterness: “It wasn’t great. Some my fault, some not my fault.” Encouraged to call out the racist coverage of Raheem Sterling and indeed himself, he refused to give an easy line and just said, for reasons that seemed obvious, that it wasn’t quite right.But then getting Cole wrong has been a shared pastime ever since he first played for England as a thrillingly assured and dynamic 20-year-old. In the years since, Cole has been a kind of cipher at times, foisted with various personas and roles that seem to speak to a much wider sense of ambient English sporting confusion. It has become fashionable now to talk about Cole as a kind of lost colossus, redeemer of the Golden Years and the one true “world class” element among that storied England group. The excellent Jamie Carragher – who has a rare gift of speaking about football in a tone of genuine child-like wonder, as though contemplating the quantum mysteries of dark matter rather than the need for someone to stand slightly closer to someone else – brought this up on Sky, suggesting Cole has been unfairly lumped in with his colleagues, whereas in fact he is our one precious totem of the lost, blessed Sven years.This is now part of the evolving narrative of that period. No doubt there is an element of restorative Cole-guilt about this. But it is also not quite right. For a start everyone knew Cole was brilliant at the time. This is not some redemptive revelation. Cole was a supreme left-back, a pure defender who used his speed and positional brain to cover his flank with a vicious precision. He didn’t reinvent the role. He wasn’t Messi or Ronaldo, although neither of those two ever scored against him. But he was hugely revered, the kind of player who made every teammate look that bit better just by standing next to him.No doubt this has been fogged a little by the enduring myths around those England players, most obviously the myth of The Fall, the idea they failed because of hubris and debauched working-class fallibility. This was defined by 2006, Baden-Baden and all that, where the players traded guaranteed World Cup glory for the opportunity to lie around their yak-fur rumpus room wearing solid-gold shoes and snorting truffle oil, mesmerised by a cabal of chav-witches constructed entirely out of plastic, greed and hanks of artificial hair.None of this really stands up, of course. The myth of The Fall is another part of the Myth of English Exceptionalism, expressed most clearly through sport, whereby the world is perceived solely through the prism of lost English supremacy, the success of others always a mistake or an interruption. And where to be talented and also English should under the natural order amount to a sure state of world domination, thwarted only by cheating foreigners or some terrible tragic flaw.So it has become a truism that Steven Gerrard, Rio Ferdinand, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Michael Owen, John Terry, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard and (just) Wayne Rooney, underachieved during their careers by the unforgivable oversight of somehow failing to win an international tournament.In reality these were hugely successful footballers who just fell short of being world beaters. Which is OK! Winning tournaments is hard. The team that should have won the 2002 World Cup had Danny Mills at right-back, as opposed to Cafu. The team that should have won Euro 2004 lost their best player before the quarters. They had a poor manager through all this too, dear old Sven, who spent six years stroking his chin and staring in bafflement at his own constipated lineup while apparently convinced international law states every football team must play rigidly enforced 4-4-2 at all times.But no, carry on. As you were. Being thwarted by that confusing and hostile substance “abroad”, being great in a way the world simply won’t allow: this is a part of the (deeply tedious) English condition that extends way beyond football. Just as still getting Ashley wrong, over-praising him now as the best, the most world-classiest of all, is a symptom of the same thing.Cole himself said it best. Should England’s golden boys have done better, he was asked. “No,” was the simple answer. “We had strong players. We just kept falling short … other teams were better than us.” Which is not just the wisest word on all that but surely the last, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3da8b8c4a09b35dd89545d9129c1515da67a038a/197_464_4004_2403/master/4004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38d9bcd1e97da364803099326f7bce5b","title":"fulham v manchester united premier league live","story":"Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial starred as United won yet another match under their interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjær.And that’s your lot. Jacob Steinberg was our man at Craven Cottage here’s his take on a fine performance from United, and a worrying one for Fulham. Thanks for reading!And now a much happier Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. “If you don’t risk, you don’t win, and it’s a squad game. You have to trust the players and I didn’t have any worries. Yes, the first ten minutes we were put under pressure, but after the first goal we were different class. I was happiest with the second half, we took the tempo down and controlled the ball, which is different to what we did against Leicester, and that’s another step in the right direction.” He’s then asked about playing Ander Herrera deeper so Paul Pogba can go further forward, and jokes that the players are “finally doing what they are told”. Oh Jose!A downcast Claudio Ranieri speaks. “I was so happy the first ten minutes, we created two good chances to score goals. But after we conceded, we had to stay calm, and we lost our composure. Our fault was big, but against Manchester United we needed to do something better. We have got to work hard, it’s important to do our best. I watched my team down 3-0, but they still wanted to score a goal, so that is a good thing. We fight.”Man-of-the-match Paul Pogba speaks! “It feels great. That’s what we wanted, since Ole came: the top four. We’re there and we want to stay there. We have big games coming up, so it won’t be easy. But we put in a good performance as a team. When we need three points, we get the three points. But these big games coming up will determine where we end up. I feel great, the team feels good.”Both teams have some big tests coming up. It doesn’t get any easier for Fulham at Craven Cottage: their next three guests will be Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City! United meanwhile prepare for a tricky triptych of their own: a Champions League tie against PSG, an FA Cup match at Chelsea, and the visit of Liverpool in the league. They do so from a good place: they’ll stay in fourth unless Chelsea get a point at City tomorrow afternoon.Nothing much happens in added time, and there’s the final whistle. An easy victory for United, Ole Gunnar Solksjaer’s tenth in 11 attempts. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were quite magnificent. They go into fourth spot, ahead of Chelsea that looked a pipe dream just a few weeks ago! PSG will hold few fears when they’re in this mood. Fulham by contrast started bright but petered out quickly. They remain in 19th spot, seven points away from safety. They’re booed off by a section of the home support.90 min: There will be three added minutes.89 min: Finally Fulham show a little fight ... albeit literally. Mitrovic and de Gea go nose to nose, the keeper running the clock down with the ball at his feet, then getting barged after he finally picked it up. It all calms down quickly enough, and they’re both booked.88 min: Mitrovic slips Sessegon into space down the left, but the flag goes up for offside.87 min: Cairney has a whack from 25 yards. It’s always going wide right.85 min: Before it can be taken, Herrera is replaced by Bailly. Mata’s corner doesn’t beat first man Ream, but it’s only half cleared, allowing McTominay to fizz a low, diagonal pass from the right wing towards the far post. Smalling slides in, but can’t connect. Close to a fourth, and that wouldn’t flatter United.84 min: See 84 min. Then Mata turns it up a little down the right, his low cross intended for Lukaku. But a corner will do.82 min: United stroke it around, feet up, pipe on.80 min: Sessegnon comes on for Bryan.79 min: Craven Cottage is pretty quiet right now, the travelling support apart. Their team started well, but have shown little spirit since falling behind. The rain comes down, matching a mood.77 min: Babel is hooked in humiliating circumstances, seconds after an astonishing miss. There’s some pinball in the United box, and the ball ends up at Babel’s feet, a yard out, just by the left-hand post. He knocks his shot against the woodwork, the rebound clanking off his shin and out of play for a goal kick. Off he goes, immediately, to ironic cheers. Cairney comes on to replace him.75 min: Fulham struggle to clear the corner. Sergio Rico flaps. Babel loses possession. That allows Sanchez, out on the left, to send a high cross into the box. McTominay flashes a header inches over the bar. That would have been quite the instant impact.74 min: McTominay comes on in place of Pogba. Then a dismal clearing header by Le Marchand clanks into Sanchez, who races clear. He should score, but allows Sergio Rico to turn the ball round the right-hand post for a corner.73 min: A lull. And then suddenly Fulham come to life, pinging it around prettily. Babel feeds Christie down the right. The resulting cross finds the head of Mitrovic, who aims for the top right. It’s on target, but there’s no real pace to the header, and de Gea plucks it from the sky easily enough.70 min:  This match couldn’t have gone much better for United. Long over, it’s being played at testimonial pace now, Fulham offering very little resistance. Time to give Martial a rest ahead of the PSG match. Sanchez comes on in his place.69 min: Chambers sends a pea-roller towards the bottom left. De Gea gathers with a yawn.68 min: Christie bothers Shaw enough to win a corner on the right. Seri hits it long to nobody in particular.67 min: Babel valiantly tries to get something going for Fulham, dribbling down the right. But he’s got no options nearby, and is soon forced to turn tail.Pogba doesn’t stutter much, by his own elaborate standards anyway. And then he sidefoots powerfully into the bottom right. Sergio Rico guessed correctly, but still had no chance. It’s not as though this third goal wasn’t coming.64 min: Lukaku bursts down the right. He could shoot himself, reward for a powerful run, but slips inside for Mata. The pass is behind Mata, and the danger looks over, but Le Marchand clumsily clips him from behind. It’s a no-brainer, in more ways than one.63 min: Herrera belts a shot towards the top left from 25 yards. Sergio Rico parries well. This is a lop-sided affair now, attack versus defence.62 min: Lukaku brings down a long ball, spins, and tries to thread a pass down the middle to release Martial. Not quite.61 min: United are in complete control of this match. Martial probes again down the left Sergio Rico punches his cross clear of danger. But the visitors keep on coming back. Another phase of passing, and Pogba tries a low drive from the edge of the D. It’s blocked, but there’s a sense that a third goal is only a matter of time. The away fans are giving it plenty the home fans, not so much.60 min: Pogba is clipped over by Seri, out on the right. Mata takes a quick free kick but only manages to scoop it into the arms of Sergio Rico.58 min: A corner for Fulham out on the left. Seri’s delivery is not great, and United are able to streak upfield in numbers. But for once they’re a little laboured in the final third, and Fulham, light at the back, escape.56 min: A dreadful clearance by Odoi is returned by Pogba, who slips Martial free into the Fulham area down the inside left. Fortunately for the hosts, Martial is flagged offside, correctly so. It’s double fortune, given Le Marchand came sliding in on Martial, clattering him to the ground. That would have been a decision for the ref to make, had the flag not gone up.55 min: Christie is quickly into the thick of it, making good ground down the right. But his cross leads to nothing. No matter, he comes again, battling hard to break through a couple of tackles and laying off to Babel. But Babel takes a heavy touch that allows Pogba to shepherd the ball out of play for a goal kick.53 min: The home fans belt out a chorus of “You don’t know what you’re doing” as Ranieri sends on Christie ... but hooks Schurrle, one of Fulham’s better players this afternoon.52 min: Mitrovic tees up Chambers, 25 yards from goal. Chambers shoots, but falls backwards while doing it. The ball sails harmlessly over the bar.51 min: Pogba and Mata make a nuisance of themselves down the inside-left channel. Martial takes up possession and nearly dribbles his way into space, but there’s no room in the area and the ball breaks through to Sergio Rico.50 min: United assumed a quiet control of this match. They’re quite happy to let Fulham ping it around the middle of the park, because the hosts are going nowhere. United conserving energy and happy to play on the break.48 min: A little bit of space for Schurrle out on the right. He clips a long diagonal ball towards the near post. There’s nobody there. De Gea calmly watches it sail behind for a goal kick.46 min: United are immediately up in Fulham’s grille. Pogba chips down the right to tee up Martial, but instead of shooting from a tight angle lays off to Mata ... who shoots from a tight angle. That’s blocked. Then Herrera has a couple of weak attempts from 20 yards. Fulham are a right old state at the back, like that’s a piece of breaking news.United get the second half underway. No half-time changes. Now, Fulham were two goals adrift at half-time in their last game at Craven Cottage, too, but came back to win 4-2. It was some story when they did that to Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion it’ll be a tale for the ages if they replicate the feat today.There’s time for one more Martial run down the left, but for once Odoi sticks with him and the ball ends up trundling into the arms of Sergio Rico. Then de Gea flaps at a Schurrle cross from the right, and there’s calls for a penalty as Jones clears, but it hit the big lad’s chest. And that’s the end of an entertaining first half. Fulham have been lively, but United’s quality at the sharp end has been the difference. Anthony Martial has been sensational.45 min: Odoi curls one in from the right. Mitrovic tries to spin Smalling, but the United defender isn’t having it, outmuscling the striker before clearing.44 min: From the resulting free kick, the ball drops to Chambers to the right of the D. He attempts to Le Tissier an insouciant volley into the bottom right, but his dipping shot is well snaffled by the safe hands of de Gea.43 min: But now he’s in the book for barging into the same player’s back. He can have no complaints, and to be fair doesn’t bother making any.42 min: Matic sticks his arm across Babel, who was trying to zip down the left, and is fortunate to escape censure.40 min: Martial causes all manner of bother down the left again. He’s got Odoi on toast. He looks for the top right, but the ball deflects out for United’s first corner of the match. The ball’s hit long. Martial reaches the byline on the left, and pulls back for Lukaku, who cocks his leg to shoot but fresh-airs it. The ball breaks to Jones on the edge of the area the big defender creams a glorious shot inches over the bar, tipped away by the fingertips of Sergio Rico. Nowt happens from the second corner.38 min: Chambers is booked for standing on Smalling’s extended leg in a 50-50 on the edge of the United area. It’s clumsy at best players have seen red for less. Thankfully Smalling is quickly up and about again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08bbd19fa7bda46a5ddd2c1911da699e7ee26580/0_89_2558_1534/master/2558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6790e61f154ea7bed89f83002f2b6e2c","title":"liverpool v bournemouth atletico madrid v real madrid live clockwatch football","story":"League One: Charlton United?

They’re still playing at the Riverside. Premier League: Jacob Steinberg was at Craven Cottage to see Manchester United swat Fulham aside. Here’s how he saw the match unfold.Championship: There has been a long delay at the Riverside Stadium, where somebody in the Leeds United dug-out – believed to be a substitute or member of the coaching staff – has been receiving treatment from paramedics.

Follow the closing stages with Scott Murray. Premier League: Fulham and Manchester United got the ball rolling in today’s early kick-off at Craven Cottage. Goals from Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial have given the visitors a comfortable lead as the clock ticks towards the hour mark and Scott Murray has the latest.The Scottish Premiership takes the weekend off so the 16 teams left in the cup can do battle.

In the meantime, here are today’s fixtures. Successive draws have put a stop to Lincoln City’s gallop, but they remain top of the ision, two points clear of Mansfield Town with a game in hand. The Imps entertain Northampton Town at Sincil Bank today, while Mansfield travel to Rodney Parade to take on Newport, who knocked Middlesbrough in the FA Cup in such fine style on Tuesday night. Six points clear at the top of the table with interim manager Mick Hartford in charge, Luton Town remain in the box-seat for promotion and will hope to stay on course with a win over Wycombe at Kenilworth Road today. In second place, six points behind, Barnsley travel to Gillingham, while third-placed Portsmouth will hope to end their poor run of form with a win over Plymouth Following last night’s thriller between Aston Villa and Sheffield United, the Championship’s other sides have a very hard act to follow. Second in the table behind Norwich on goal difference, Leeds are in Middlesbrough for today’s early kick-off and it remains scoreless with 35 minutes gone.

Many people died and I was lucky to survive, but I broke my back.

Grandpa, Ken, died five months later so I was glad to keep Grandma company.I work from home now as a tutor. I’m a bit slapdash, whereas she likes everything done the way she and Grandpa did for 68 years. She’s been very tolerant, and I’ve been intermittently tolerant of her chatting while I’m working.

Can a lie-in at the weekend make up for late nights during the week? We separate the fact from the fictionA siesta is not the same thing as a power nap. Siestas are a cultural norm in certain places (particularly in hot countries) where people take a brief rest after lunch. We can do this because our circadian biology (body clock) has a natural dip in the afternoon and there is a natural lull in our alertness. If we are extremely sleepy during the day then we should stop and take a nap – especially if our jobs require alertness (lorry drivers, for example). A nap of 15-25 minutes avoids getting into deep sleep, but can still renew levels of alertness and restore the brain’s capacity for learning – and even improve mood. However, sleep is not a commodity to be turned off and on as we see fit. Naps don’t replace the need for night-time sleep.No, but everyone should make sure they get enough sleep. Don’t burn the candle at either end.To some extent, but it’s important to remember our daytime performance during the week will be suboptimal when we have had insufficient sleep during night-time. Sleep is a better investment in productivity overall than working too late and depriving ourselves of sleep.Not necessarily. Everyone has arousals at night, but if they are frequent and troublesome then you should make an appointment with your GP.Not according to research conducted by Oxford University in 2002. It’s “just too mundane to effectively keep worries away”, according to cognitive psychologist Dr Allison Harvey. In test groups, those who thought of idyllic, beautiful places, such as a beach in the south of France, went to sleep on average 20 minutes earlier than they would normally do on nights when they were not concentrating on faraway places. The sheep counters actually stayed awake for longer than their normal ration of restlessness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1f95e5537b12a2827675fdd1879d232e85e86d/0_1575_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=069d91d1d889281c2c79f542dfd474bc","title":"worm composting a beginners guide","story":"A wormery can provide nutrients for your plants throughout the growing seasonI took my love to a fishing tackle shop to buy a squirm of worms. We went home, dumped them ceremoniously into a bin and she declared it a dream date. I felt blessed, in no minor part because, now she has a worm bin, composting can ensue in earnest at her place.Worm bins come into their own in limited spaces (balconies and courtyards, say), because they are contained and efficient even on a reduced scale. Small bins don’t produce a huge amount of worm compost, but you don’t need a great deal because it is so concentrated in nutrients and minerals. Just one tablespoon provides enough nutrients for a plant to grow through the season, and it is the only fresh manure that can be used directly and won’t scorch plants.It can be used on everything from houseplants to vegetables in pots and in seedling drills in the garden. It has excellent moisture-retentive properties, and it is good for disease and pest control, because it is microbially rich and contains fungus-eating nematodes and protozoa as well as high levels of chitinase (one of nature’s insect repellants).Pre-made bins are available for about £65, but you can make your own from plastic storage bins or catering-sized food containers (10-litre mayonnaise bins and the like). Then all you need is some bedding, worms and food scraps. There are numerous online resources to take you through the process: one of the best I’ve found is theurbanworm.Once you’ve got your bin, you need to acquire some worms. You cannot dig up earthworms from outside (they would hate to live in a bin) you need brandling or compost worms, which you can get online or from fishing-tackle shops, where you buy by weight. The rule of thumb is 200g of worms will eat 50-100 grams of food a day, but this may be less in cold weather.Worms like all sorts of things, but stay away from anything acidic such as citrus, onions, dairy and meat. They need a regular source of carbon to absorb moisture and act as bedding: you can use either coir or shredded paper, toilet rolls, corrugated cardboard (ripped up) and egg cartons.Worms are voracious eaters, but they have very small mouths. Allowing your kitchen scraps to partially break down in a caddy, or chopping their food first, will mean they can work faster for you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0f9a4f0bb55edb1523f4b6eabb4dd3033e1244a/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c2d3878daf937de29a2f01edb04ecf9","title":"one to watch roses gabor debut album fantasy and facts","story":"After dazzling cameos for Gorillaz and SBTRKT, the Londoner is about to step into the spotlight with her debut albumFor those interested in the delicate, immersive end of UK dance and electronica, Roses Gabor may already be familiar. The north-west London vocalist has been around for a while now, her powerful vocals finding a home on tracks with SBTRKT, Machinedrum, Shy FX and Gorillaz.The child of Grenadian parents, Gabor (born Rosemary Wilson) was always interested in music, growing up on a healthy diet of soca, Stevie Wonder and Capital FM – though her favourites were Mary J Blige and Michael Jackson. It was only after a chance encounter with a member of Gorillaz while working a nine-to-five job at a bank that her first collaboration (Dare) took shape.Now ready to step beyond those dazzling features for other artists, Gabor releases her much anticipated debut album this month. It’s an assured, fascinating full-length on which her breathy, entrancing vocals top mind-bending soundscapes (the album’s first single, I Could Be Yours, melds plush synths with what sounds like a Bollywood sample).Collaborating with the likes of MNEK, “afrowave”-trio Team Salut and Sampha, it’s a record that crackles with liturgical ambition as much as beguiling bangers.

But sources close to the group, led by the Tory MP Nick Boles and Labour’s Yvette Cooper, said it seemed likely that the prime minister would be given more time to discuss a Labour Brexit proposal and hold more talks with Brussels.“The Tory MPs are keen to give the PM a chance to follow up on the cross-party talks, and negotiations with the EU,” the source said. A bill laying out how MPs could seek to avoid a no-deal departure may nonetheless be published next week, they said.“There’s a definite sense that lots of Tories are worried about no deal, but they don’t want to look like they are trying to obstruct her negotiations,” the source said. “There is very definitely a majority in parliament against no deal, but it’s a question of how to proceed and when.”The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who supported the last Cooper-Boles amendment, told the : “Our position is that the ball is in the PM’s court. What we do depends on what the PM does.”Any further delay would be contingent on May promising a future date for either a vote on her deal or another amendable motion, he said, adding: “Parliament has to have its say.”It sets the scene for an increasingly tense couple of weeks in which May will attempt to stitch together a Brexit plan that can get a parliamentary majority while the EU and backbenchers watch the clock tick down towards 29 March.After a bruising set of talks in Brussels on Thursday in which the European council president, Donald Tusk, mentioned Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals as a way of breaking the impasse, May was to meet the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for a dinner in Dublin on Friday.The talks were intended to build on discussions May had in Northern Ireland and Brussels this week, her spokeswoman said. “She’ll be emphasising what we are looking for: seeking the legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that parliament said it needs to approve the deal.”Earlier on Friday the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, met his Irish counterpart, Séamus Woulfe, for talks on the backstop, the insurance policy intended to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland if no permanent agreement can be reached.May and Cox are pushing for changes to the backstop such as a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK, a key demand of the DUP and many Conservative backbenchers, but the chances of any progress seem slight.Speaking earlier in Belfast, where he met Northern Irish parties, Varadkar said that while the meal with May was an opportunity to “share perspectives” on Brexit, actual negotiations “can only be between the European Union and the United Kingdom”.“There is much more that unites us than ides us and time is running short, and we need to get to an agreement really as soon as possible,” he said.In an interview shown on RTE, the Irish state broadcaster, on Friday night, Varadkar said he thought a deal could be done, but he was unsure if it would happen before the UK leaves the EU. “I think that on balance we will secure a deal – whether it will be by the end of March or after an extension, I can’t say,” he said.May has yet to formally respond to Corbyn’s letter on Wednesday in which he said Labour would support her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments, including joining a customs union.The Labour leader faces disquiet from some of his MPs over the move, which some have interpreted as a shift away from the possibility of pushing for a second referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cecec84e82a5a9c2562fc2e18147ddeaeb4a4d6/0_303_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3dba023a600239c3a3fa7beaa30ca24","title":"brexit uk companies discuss moving to netherlands","story":"Dutch government says it has already gained 1,900 jobs from Britain in bid for Brexit spoilsThe Dutch government has said it is in talks with more than 250 companies about moving their operations from the UK to the Netherlands before Brexit.The economic affairs ministry said it had lured 42 companies or branch offices and 1,923 jobs from the UK last year, as it increases its efforts to gain Brexit business.Among those who have chosen to invest in the Netherlands are the Discovery Channel, Sony and Bloomberg.Sony announced last month it was moving its European headquarters to Amsterdam, as companies in the UK continue to progress with contingency plans. Its rival Panasonic has already moved to the Dutch capital.The government report said another Japanese company, the investment bank Norinchukin, was also moving to Amsterdam, along with the global content company TVT Media, the financial services providers MarketAxess and Azimo, and the maritime insurer UK P\u0026ampI Club.While Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, recently said he did not see Brexit as a business opportunity, countries including Ireland, France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg have been actively looking for opportunities to capitalise on Brexit ever since the EU referendum.Banks and other financial services are obliged to have operations in a member state if they want to serve a pan-EU market, while broadcasters who transmit across the EU need to have a licence in one member state to meet regulations.The BBC is considering setting up an international base in Belgium.The Dutch economic affairs ministry said: “In 2019, several companies including Discovery and Bloomberg have already announced their intention to invest in the Netherlands because of Brexit.“Additionally, the Netherlands foreign investment agency is talking with more than 250 foreign companies considering setting up operations in the Netherlands following Brexit.”Most of the 250 companies were British, but some were American or Asian firms reconsidering their European branch structures, the report said.“These include companies in the financial sector, media and advertising, life sciences and health and logistics.”The number of companies relocating to an EU member state is expected to grow. Both the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British industry said recently that businesses needed certainty and visibility for investment and could not ride out the political uncertainty.France has identified 50 companies, including motor and pharmaceutical industries, that it is trying to entice across the Channel.Last month President Emmanuel Macron hosted an investment summit for more than 140 business leaders, including bosses of companies with a significant British presence, such as Goldman Sachs, Google and Siemens.Last week the boss of Siemens UK, Jürgen Maier, said Britain and the Conservative party were being held to ransom by hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2768aad0ae18ce831877ba9e8992dbb41d1993ab/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35ea0ce7722a7528cf93b4abc9a583f9","title":"buy your wine now the bordeaux vineyards bottling before brexit","story":"Nobody knows if wine will still flow freely across the Channel if the UK crashes out without a deal They are bottling early this year at Château Bauduc. The shining, million-euro, steel-and-glass mobile bottling plant and its six-strong crew have arrived and are hard at work in a thin late-January sun: rinsing, drying, filling, capping, labelling.“Last year, we didn’t bottle till March,” says Gavin Quinney, who with his wife, Angela, has been producing a range of critically acclaimed Bordeaux blanc white and Bordeaux supérieur red wines from their 25 hectares (62 acres) of vines since 2000.“This year, we’ve brought it forward. We have to get enough stock, at least six months, into the UK before the end of March. It’d just be dumb not to. There’s no Brexit that’ll be good for this business. But a no-deal Brexit will be a catastrophe.”Quinney’s immediate concerns are technical and logistical, but crucial. The European commission and the British government have already confirmed that if the UK falls out of the EU without a deal on 29 March, Britain will leave the bloc’s electronic excise movement and control system (EMCS).“The consequences of that don’t really bear thinking about,” he says. “It’s the online system for moving alcohol round Europe. It makes the business seamless, gets trucks through Calais and Dover with a minimum of checks, means governments are confident they’ll get their VAT and duty.”Without EMCS, Quinney says, the only feasible fallback – until a new system arrives, which could take months or even years – will be pieces of paper, and pieces of paper spell long, long delays. “We know that no deal will mean logjams, complete chaos, at Calais and Dover for everyone,” he says.“Pretty soon, it would be hard to find a transporter willing or able to take the job. Plus, in warm weather you really can’t have quality wine stuck for two or three days at the border unless it’s in refrigerated trucks, which cost a fortune. We have no option but to shift what stock we can now.”EMCS is what makes it feasible – and profitable – for Adrian Munns to spend several days filling an articulated lorry with wine from more than 20 different Bordeaux producers, including Château Bauduc, then drive it, twice a month, to four or five different destinations in Britain.“Without it, my job would be impossible,” says Munns, 62. “I’d just give up if that went, I think. Retire. I can’t imagine going back to the old forms it’d be a nightmare. They won’t be able to come up with a similar system for years.”Munns says Château Bauduc is far from alone in building up stock in Britain. For his UK trade customers, Quinney aims to have tens of thousands of bottles – at significant extra cost – stored in bonded warehousing by mid-March.He is also launching a promotional deal for private customers, offering them duty and tax-free collection from a Calais warehouse before Brexit day. “Our bottom line is: buy your wine now,” he says. “Fill the garage and the spare room. Because frankly, nobody has the faintest clue what happens next.”The industry is “very concerned indeed” by Brexit, and particularly the prospect of no deal, says Sichel, who also runs the family’s 135-year-old wine merchants. “When we know what we have to do, of course we’ll be able to do it,” he says. “But right now we don’t know what will change, and we may not have time to get ready for it.”The UK is the fourth biggest global market for Bordeaux wines, accounting for nearly 24m bottles last year – a trade that dates back to the three centuries after 1154, when much of Aquitaine in south-west France was ruled by the kings of England and profits from the sale of clairet, or claret, were the crown’s main source of income.There is “real passion for our wines in Britain, and a huge amount of expertise”, says Sichel. But the impact of Brexit is “already perceptible. Buyers are building up stock, but also asking for delays on their payments … The pound is weak, UK duty is high. They want us to absorb some of the costs. There’s already pressure.”Significant delays at Calais, with trucks blocked for two to three days awaiting customs clearance and regulatory inspections, would “add exponentially to everyone’s costs, and inevitably end up reducing demand”, Sichel says. “That’s just not tenable. And any further big falls in sterling would be disastrous.”British fine wine merchants have “bought wisely and hold plenty of good stock”, Decré says. Besides, those happy to pay €100-plus for a bottle of wine – let alone €2,500 for a bottle of Château Pétrus, or the €480,000 recently fetched by a 1945 Romanée-Conti – “will not suffer greatly from Brexit”.Philippe Castéja, of the leading Bordeaux wine merchants and château-owners Borie-Manoux, says he is “not overly concerned … The chaos of a no deal would be so enormous that it simply couldn’t last – Britain wouldn’t survive. They’d have to sort it out. It’ll be rather complicated for everyone for a few months, though, no doubt.”But back at Château Bauduc, Quinney is – like many Bordeaux producers – equally worried by the impact on his business of even a negotiated UK departure from the EU. “Anyone in the wine trade will tell you: it was tough before Brexit,” he says.“An intensely competitive market, already hit hard by the low pound and high duty. If we’re also out of EU regulatory alignment, the customs union, the single market … It’s just a whole load of unwanted extra hassle, for everyone. Some people are going to ask if it’s worth it. You wouldn’t have these problems selling to Belgium.”As a non-essential product, UK wine sales will inevitably be hit by any post-Brexit fall in consumer spending power or confidence, Quinney is sure. If that is accompanied by transport problems and customs delays for producers, the whole shape of the business might change .“Some will look elsewhere,” he says. “The market for mid-range, estate-bottled wine in the UK could collapse. Producers may start shipping lower-grade wines in bulk and bottling it in the UK, like the Australians do now. Bordeaux might become a port again, who knows? People will try to be creative. But, yes, it’s going to be very tough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d274241271fe4c2cdede21bfb7614d3db6aa5c/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87806a30d07eea4f27c7df0a42c2e014","title":"government cancels brexit ferry contract with no ship firm","story":"A controversial no-deal Brexit ferry contract awarded to a firm with no ships has been cancelled by the Department for Transport after an Irish shipping firm that had been secretly backing the deal pulled out.The decision by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to award Seaborne Freight a contract worth £13.8m had attracted widespread criticism and ridicule.It was one of three firms awarded contracts totalling £108m in late December to lay on additional crossings from Ramsgate to ease the pressure on Dover when Britain leaves the EU, despite the company having never run a Channel service.The department said on Friday it had decided to terminate the contract after Arklow Shipping, which had backed Seaborne Freight, stepped away from the deal.A DfT spokeswoman said: “Following the decision of Seaborne Freight’s backer, Arklow Shipping, to step back from the deal, it became clear Seaborne would not reach its contractual requirements with the government. We have therefore decided to terminate our agreement.“The government is already in advanced talks with a number of companies to secure additional freight capacity – including through the port of Ramsgate – in the event of a no-deal Brexit.”The contract was cancelled a day after Grayling contacted Thanet district council to ask it to postpone a budget that would have shut down parts of the port of Ramsgate for use by freight shipping.Keeping the site open is costing local taxpayers £7,224 a day, according to a local source, and the council – which has already spent months in fruitless negotiations with Seaborne – had proposed shutting it down to help balance the books.The DfT persuaded the council to keep it open, claiming that talks with Seaborne were at an “advanced stage”, according to Paul Messenger, a local Conservative councillor.He said the port was costing about £2m a year: “That’s why we haven’t got any road sweepers, that’s why we haven’t got any public lavatories.”Questions remain about the viability of Ramsgate’s port for use post-Brexit. It can only accommodate ships up to 180 metres long, but modern ships are typically 230-250 metres to allow for the economies of scale that make them sustainable.John Davis, a member of the Ramsgate Action Group, said: “You can’t run a double-decker bus service out of a single-storey garage on the side of a bungalow – that’s the problem.”The government’s deal with Seaborne descended into farce at the beginning of January when it emerged that the company had copied and pasted the terms and conditions from what appeared to be a pizza delivery company on to its website.Several weeks later, the transport select committee published correspondence with Grayling in which he brushed off a number of questions about the procurement process that had led to the contract with Seaborne, as well as allegations that the government may have acted illegally by failing to put the deal out to tender.Grayling insisted last month that the Seaborne Freight contract was “not a risk”.The DfT said it had been Arklow Shipping’s backing that gave it confidence in the viability of the deal, and that it stood by the due diligence carried out on Seaborne Freight.It said no taxpayer money had been transferred to the company.The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s just another example of a major disaster on the hands of Chris Grayling, who actually must now really class as the worst secretary of state ever.”Andy McDonald MP, the shadow transport secretary, said the cancellation had been foreseen by his party and could not go without consequence.“Whilst Theresa May needs the few friends she has right now, we cannot have this incompetent transport secretary carry on heaping humiliation after humiliation on our country. He has to go.”The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, raised the “ludicrous situation” in a speech in Coventry on Saturday, saying: “Chris Grayling … claimed the government had ‘looked very carefully’ at Seaborne Freight before giving the company the contract, but apparently not carefully enough to notice that it didn’t have any ships. Chris Grayling does have form in other departments.”“The whole exercise is a complete and utter shambles, with the government ignoring union calls on what needs to happen. Instead they are blundering on from crisis to crisis.”A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Our priority is to avoid disruption to businesses as we leave the EU and more DIT staff have been allocated to no-deal planning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e808aa0c857d3f0dcafcaa7c14aea547d060f80/0_145_4550_2731/master/4550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73234aae1781a8910e51211e7856219f","title":"labour unveils plan to give voice to neglected councils","story":"Commission comprising local government representatives would meet ministers monthlyLabour has announced proposals for a new representative body for councils to give them a regular voice at Westminster and a direct say on policy.Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities and local government secretary, will set out the plans for a local government commission, made up of leaders from all types of local authority.Under Labour, the representatives would meet every month with the communities secretary and other cabinet ministers and “inform decision-making”, Gwynne will say in a speech to the Local Government Association (LGA) conference in Warwick.Labour said the current communities secretary, James Brokenshire, had met directly with just one council in April to June last year, the last three months for which records were available.There have been significant cuts to central grants for councils since 2010, and the LGA says its members are facing a funding gap of £3.2bn in the next financial year.He will say: “For nine years, ministers have sat in meetings in Whitehall and cut funding to councils hundreds of miles away, never having to see the library that is closed, the potholes that go unfixed and the elderly people that go without care as a result.“To fix our broken political system which has left people disconnected and disillusioned with Westminster politics, we need to put local people and communities at the heart of decision-making.”The new commission would “ensure that councillors can influence every decision that affects local councils”, he will say. “We need their guidance, your support and your advice, in ensuring that from Whitehall to our town halls we are being as effective as possible in helping our hardworking communities. Gone will be the days when we have a secretary of state for local government that doesn’t want to know local government.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace151e2c3ec64fff9564acdd76b1f7afc076134/0_212_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=db013faae30365f3d5553af530ddf0d4 930w","title":"daley mclean england france womens six nations le crunch","story":"England and France notched up more than half a century of points in their opening fixtures of the Women’s Six Nations and Sunday’s meeting in Doncaster will decide the fate of this year’s title.Simon Middleton, the England coach, happily concedes that last season’s grand slam winners are favourites but the only certainty at Castle Park will be that the match between the two sides that have shared 20 of the 23 titles since the tournament started will be nail-bitingly close.The Red Roses warmed their supporters on a freezing night in Dublin, running in eight tries in a 51-3 win only for France to go one better the following night in Montpellier, crossing the Welsh line nine times in a 52-3 victory just in case Middleton’s newly professional players were getting above themselves.One thing is predictable , though. It is that Katy Daley-Mclean, England’s fly-half, will become the first English woman to pass the landmark of 500 international points. The 33-year-old is now on 499. She was the player of the match at Donnybrook, scoring 16 points and orchestrating things behind a dominant pack.England know, though, that France will be a tougher nut to crack than the Irish and are without their hard-nosed back-rower Marlie Packer, who injured a shoulder in Dublin. She is replaced at open-side by Poppy Leitch, a 21-year-old with bags of potential but not Packer’s big-match experience. Middleton has moved Poppy Cleall from the second row to blind-side flanker and brought in two more experienced forwards. Vickii Cornborough for the 19-year-old Hannah Botterman at loose-head prop and Abbie Scott at lock.Daley-McLean, meanwhile, has played in enough games against France to know that Annick Heyraud’s pack will set them a difficult examination. “I remember a Six Nations game in France in 2010, which we won 12-9 when they missed a kick at the death,” she said. “These games are always close. The game will be decided by the forwards at the set-pieces and breakdown.“We have to make sure we have a massive statement of intent from the off. We have the big, ball-carrying forwards but we also have some dangerous backs. It’ll be about getting the balance right against France.“They have a very mobile back row and their No 8, Romane Ménager, carries well. The scrum-half, Pauline Bourdon, is also important for them. She’s always looking to attack the line. In Dublin, we knew we had to be on the money and this will be no different. We have to take our chances and it’s my job to help create them. And yes, I know that first kick at goal will be important. I’d just like it to be in front of the posts.”Middleton is hoping Packer will be back in time for the trip to Cardiff to face Wales this month. “Marlie doesn’t need surgery and she’ll be back on the park soon but Poppy is in great form and Vickii and Abbie are very influential forwards.“Given their recent form and the fact that France come in as champions, they rightly go into the game as favourites but we’ve got confidence in this squad and we’ve had some excellent preparation in the week.”England also have the extra motivation of avenging last year’s agonising 18-17 defeat before a record crowd for the women’s Six Nations in Grenoble when the full-back Jessy Tremouliere slipped through their defence in last minute for the winning try. The injured world player of the year for 2018 will not be in Doncaster this weekend.England’s trouncing of Ireland, meanwhile, was put into perspective by the Irish win in Glasgow on Friday night. They secured a 22-5 bonus-point victory over Scotland who, with trips to France and England to come, now face the prospect of the wooden spoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0b3eff4b244456fc7f91761b0a35705b624245/12_214_3320_1993/master/3320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee6fd50d473101b42e4fc91efaea625e","title":"france rugby decade decline six nations","story":"Empty seats, low rankings and an ever-present ‘fear of winning’. What has gone wrong across the Channel?On Thursday, the French rugby club Carcassonne announced that they were entering into a commercial partnership with the pornographic website Jacquie et Michel, on the grounds that they “share values of power, endurance, and vigour”.Carcassonne’s general manager, Christine Menardeau-Planchenault, explained that “as a family club” they had put limits on what Jacquie et Michel could get up to. “There won’t be any naked young women at half-time or any naked rugby,” she explained. Despite that, Menardeau-Planchenault added that while it is normally “hard to get people to the stadium”, tickets for their upcoming match against Biarritz were now “flying out of the box office”.If there has been a sudden swelling of enthusiasm for rugby in that little corner of the south, the mood everywhere else in the country is growing pretty listless. The Stade de France was only three-quarters full during the opening match of the championship against Wales. It was a Friday night kick-off, which did not help, but the real problem, as Bernard Laporte, the head of the French Federation, said on TV last weekend, is: “We have a French team which no longer makes us dream.”Laporte thinks it has been that way for the past 10 years. Right now, France are ranked 10th in the world, and are closer in points to Spain, who are 21st, than to New Zealand, who are first.France’s record was bad enough under their last coach, Guy Novès, who won seven of his 21 matches. It is even worse under his replacement, Jacques Brunel, who took over at the start of last year. Under him France have won only three games out of 12, one against Italy, one against England and one against Argentina.Laporte has been forced into defending his old friend Brunel, even though, as he admits himself, there is no good defence to offer. “We changed the coach just over a year ago because we felt things weren’t going very well, and we can’t say that they’re going much better today,” Laporte said. “But it would be difficult, and certainly dangerous, to make new changes now.”The odd thing is France were leading at half-time in seven of those same games and then went on to lose five of them. That pattern includes three of the last four Tests they have played, against South Africa, Fiji and Wales.It is one of the more surprising sequences in rugby union – France have not won a Six Nations match at Twickenham for 14 years, and have won only twice there since the game turned professional in 1995:March 1997: England 20-23 FranceEngland led 20-6 after an hour but France staged a remarkable comeback with tries by Laurent Leflamand and Christophe Lamaison. Lamaison was a one-man points machine, scoring 18 from a try, two conversions, two penalties and a drop goal. Abdelatif Benazzi’s side would go on to claim a Five Nations grand slam.February 2005: England 17-18 France Tries from Olly Barkley and Josh Lewsey gave England a 17-6 half-time lead, but the scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili kicked six penalties while Charlie Hodgson and Barkley missed six between them, as France inflicted the world champions’ eighth defeat in 11 Tests.The other matches: England’s gloryEleven home wins since 1995, from the resounding – the 55-35 triumph in March 2015 with England chasing the title on the last day (they came up just short) – to the narrow 19-16 win two years ago, when Ben Te’o’s 71st-minute try made the difference.When Wales came back from 16 points down at half-time last week, Warren Gatland said his team had “forgotten how to lose”. Truth is, it is probably more accurate to say that Brunel’s team have forgotten how to win. Across those 12 Tests under Brunel, France won the first half by an average score of 13-11, and then lost the second by 15-8. They have taken some beatings in the second 40: 18-6 by Scotland, 44-0 by New Zealand, 20-10 by South Africa.Chris Ashton, who spent two years playing for Toulon, suggested this past week that the French players were not used to the intensity of international rugby, because they play such “a slow stop-start game” in the Top 14. “Maybe that step-up shocks them,” the recalled England wing said. “I’d definitely say the Premiership is a lot more intense. The ball is in play a lot more, and the whole game is quicker.”But in France, they are more worried about the mental strength of the players than their physical fitness. And with good reason. “In the course of the match there is always this fear of winning that resurfaces, these old demons who come back,” said their young scrum-half Baptiste Serin this week. “It can only be in the head,” says Laporte.The No 8 Louis Picamoles says all the criticism is starting to weigh on Les Bleus. “We want to be aware of how lucky we are to be here, to enjoy these moments, despite the bad luck we’ve had. There were some very positive things about last Friday, but we’ve all been talking a lot about the negatives. I don’t want to sound like we’re a bunch of teddy bears, but the danger is if we keep seeing, reading, hearing negative things, we’ll become negative too. It doesn’t help us.”Brunel has started to fold in some of the young French players who won the under-20s world championship last year, such as Romain Ntamack and Demba Bamba. The danger is that by playing in a losing team they are learning all the wrong things.There is hope, Laporte says, in this new generation, who should be ready by the time France host the World Cup in 2023. But even he seems to have given up on the tournament before it, in Japan at the end of this year. “I wouldn’t bet my house that we will be world champions, mathematically there is very little chance,” Laporte said. However, in his next breath, he added: “But our team has potential, and hopefully anything is possible.” He, at least, hasn’t given up dreaming just yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47820cf75bdb1dcf5f1398953647af73ac297e02/0_276_5057_3033/master/5057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde5260d4aed943ae09cb0fc767865f0","title":"scotland v ireland six nations 2019 live","story":"54 mins: Ack, that promising position is surrendered as Harley knocks on.

Blair Kinghorn wallops a kick downfield, and although Kearney kicks for touch, that’s a big territorial swing for Scotland.50 mins: Make that seven, as from the scrum, Cian Healy knocks on and has a stern word with himself. It’s become a bit scrappy after that dramatic first half.49 mins: Scotland’s progress downfield is stopped by an unlucky Strauss knock-on. He’s not happy with the referee, but rules are rules. Handling errors creeping up for Scotland - they have 10 to Ireland’s six.48 mins: Best delivers the lineout, Ireland win it and start an ominous drive for the line. Scotland hold on through 10 phases, and a loose pass puts Earls on the back foot. Stuart McInally stops him in his tracks, the momentum shifts, and Ireland are penalised. More sterling defensive work, this time from the hosts.45 mins: Ireland enjoy a spell of possession, and Rob Harley is penalised for a high tackle. Ireland can’t make use of the advantage, but Carbery kicks for the corner...42 mins: Scottish scrum on the halfway line, and Laidlaw starts a passing move out wide - but Gray concedes a cheap penalty, taking Sean O’Brien out needlessly.Joey Carbery kicks off the second half - no sign of Johnny Sexton. Ritchie is back for Scotland, but Rob Harley stays out there, with Ryan Wilson taken off.Here’s our new Six Nations columnist, Ugo Monye, with a look ahead to England v France tomorrow:We’ve just seen a clip of Stuart Hogg reacting to that late missed chance on the touchline. He got himself in a right old funk, booting a hole in an advertising hoarding before storming down the tunnel.That first half had pretty much everything - flowing attacking moves, ferocious defence and inidual errors that have been ruthlessly punished. Scotland have dominated territory, and end on the front foot, but it’s Ireland who have a narrow lead. Don’t go anywhere.39 mins: The Irish defence holds on through 20 phases, but as play shifts back to the right, there’s room for Seymour - but Jones’ pass is just behind him, and Stockdale holds him up a metre out. A Scottish knock-on follows, and Ireland hold firm! An incredible defensive effort.38 mins: Scotland frantically searching for the go-ahead score, and get an advantage for an Irish knock-on. They keep scrambling for the line - the advantage goes untaken - but look for space on the far side...35 mins: A moment to sum up this helter-skelter first half, as a loose ball bounces off the corner flag, and Best es in to stop Scotland snatching a bizarre second try. Scotland will have a scrum, five metres out. Rob Harley is on for Ritchie, who has a nasty cut above his eye.34 mins: More inventive attacking play from the Scottish backs, before Seymour’s kick down the line is dealt with by Keith Earls. No official word on whether Sexton is returning he was targeted by Scotland, Dell and Wilson landing huge hits on him before he went off.32 mins: Stockdale looks isolated underneath a kick downfield, with Huw Jones bearing down on him - but keeps his cool to clear away.A terrific conversion from Greig Laidlaw, who sneaks his effort inside the far post in swirling winds. It’s back on now!Scotland get the try they deserve! Laidlaw’s kick is almost claimed by Seymour, but Ireland get an advantage for the knock-on. They don’t use it, and Carbery’s pass is intercepted cleanly by Finn Russell. The fly-half looks bound to score, but hesitates and is caught by Earls. No matter - he finds Sam Johnson who touches down instead.26 mins: O’Mahony shows he can do it all, sending a fine grubber kick down the touchline with the outside of his boot. Silky stuff, from which Scotland win a lineout under pressure...25 mins: O’Mahony, at his dominant best so far, strips the ball from Scottish hands. The counter-attack breaks down, but Ireland have a scrum, from which Jack Conan leads them to the halfway line...24 mins: Sexton is off, replaced by Carbery - a blood replacement, for the time being at least. Hogg hasn’t been missed by Scotland so far, mainly because Kinghorn has been excellent.22 mins: Ritchie snatches the ball from an Aki knock-on, and Scotland can counter here. Kinghorn finds Seymour, who goes for the corner but runs out of room. His attempted pass run loose, and Sam Johnson tries to pin the ball against the corner flag. The play will be reviewed, and the TMO quickly establishes there was a forward pass early on.20 mins: Ireland dominate the scrum and get a penalty. Sexton kicks for touch, but he may be nursing a groin injury. Hogg won’t be returning - he has a shoulder problem, and is looking forlorn on the Scottish bench.18 mins: Scotland look to respond immediately and Kinghorn breaks downfield. They get to within five metres, and win a penalty, which is taken quickly. Scotland try to set up a maul, but there’s a knock on. Ireland celebrate gleefully, and Romain Poite has to cool everyone down. This has been a terrific start.This is much more like it from Ireland. From a ruck, O’Mahony and Sexton combine to create space for Jacob Stockdale, who bursts through midfield and sprints downfield to score. Murray, not Sexton, lands the conversion.15 mins: Hogg claims Sexton’s kick downfield, and clears to touch - but he doesn’t look comfortable, and is going to have to come off! The aforementioned Blair Kinghorn replaces him.13 mins: Ireland looked nervous early on, but a couple of inidual errors have let them back into the game. Now they’re on the front foot, Seymour forced to scamper back and deal with Farrell’s dangerous kick through. Ireland have an attacking lineout...Missed conversion! A short delay as Sexton gets treatment from the physio. Murray prepares to take the kick instead, but Sexton gets up - and skews it wide!Ireland regain possession and Stockdale sends a kick down the left touchline. Under pressure from Farrell, Seymour throws a poor pass towards Maitland, who can’t hold it - and Conor Murray is on hand to score a simple try!9 mins: That strong start is undone somewhat by Huw Jones, who spills Sexton’s restart kick into touch. Ireland scrum on the Scottish 22, but they can’t make inroads and lose patience - and Scotland turn it over!Laidlaw takes the three points, and the hosts lead after an encouraging start.5 mins: Hogg kicks it to the corner, and Scotland win the lineout and barrel for the line. Ireland hold firm but Aki is penalised for using his hands in the ruck. Laidlaw’s grubber kick is collected by Kearney, but they’ll have a simple penalty chance.3 mins: Scotland can come again, and sweep the ball from left to right, and back again, where Hogg breaks through a tackle. Advantage for the hosts - a high tackle on Ryan Wilson from Sexton. Scotland have numbers over on the far side but can’t put Strauss through, and they come back for the penalty...1 min: Hogg collects Murray’s box-kick and Scotland try to put immediate pressure on. Ireland win a lineout, but Murray’s second box kick is held up in the wind...Stuart Hogg hoofs his opening drop-kick high into the air, and we’re off!The anthems ring out - ‘Ireland’s Call’ followed by ‘Flower of Scotland’. A stirring double-header, if ever I heard one. It’s on!Edinburgh’s Blair Kinghorn is on the bench today after scoring three tries against Italy last weekend. I understand that his replacement, Sean Maitland, is first-choice, but should you ever drop a player after they score a hat-trick? Your thoughts welcome.“Ireland will be like a wounded buffalo, nostrils flared” saysGregor Townsend’s pre-match comments can be filed under ‘bullish’:“We know Ireland are going to play well. They’re champions, they’re a very good team. I thought England tactically played very well, but they’re a different team to us. I’m confident we can beat anyone in the world when we’re at our best.”Joe Schmidt has a chat with the BBC, and bristles at suggestions that Ireland were comprehensively beaten by England: “We were maybe a little bit underdone, we don’t always start the Six Nations particularly well. I wouldn’t say it was necessarily comprehensive, but we did get beaten and got beaten up.Schmidt also names no less than seven Scottish players who offer a threat, in a Bielsa-esque summary of today’s opponents.The recent beef between these two sides perhaps stems from a strange incident back in 2007, when Eddie O’Sullivan accused a Scottish player of trying to choke Ronan O’Gara. The former Ireland fly-half fanned the flames before Scotland’s win in 2017, saying on live TV that the hosts were “too mouthy”.There’s also been plenty of needle in club matches between Glasgow and Munster, with Conor Murray accusing Josh Strauss and Jonny Gray of cynical challenges in a Champions Cup game. All three men start today, and there are 19 players in total from those two regions.When you’re on top of the world, it’s a long way down. Ireland may have been tempted before their opener with England to look beyond the Six Nations, to arriving in Japan as the kings of the north. Instead, they head to Scotland under unexpected pressure after a comprehensive defeat in Dublin.Joe Schmidt’s side can expect another bruising encounter today. These two sides have a spiky recent history, with bad blood in club and international contests, and even a row over a delayed bus journey when Ireland last visited Murrayfield. That was two years ago, when Scotland shattered the visitors’ grand slam hopes. A similar result again today would leave the hosts eyeing up a title tilt of their own, but Ireland will be desperate to avenge the damage done to their reputation both here in 2017, and in Dublin last Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps.

Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way.

Whose can it be? There’s a wonderful curving greenhouse that leans on an ancient wall. There are palms and lemon trees, fragments of time-worn statuary, an elegant wrought-iron table with a chair. On the table is a folded newspaper and a steaming espresso coffee, but no gardener visible. It’s all a bit untidy and overgrown, enclosed by tawny walls capped with pan tiles, many apparently ready to slide off on to the artfully abandoned terracotta urns below. This is exactly what I expected and wanted from Tuscany: a place that looked carelessly civilised, and had been that way for a very long time.When I arrived the previous night at the Hotel Loggiato dei Serviti, I’d asked the barman how old the building was. “It was built in 1492,” he told me, “the year of Columbus.”In that same year, local artist Leonardo da Vinci turned 40, while up-and-coming teenage rival Michelangelo was nursing a broken nose after a fight in the Carmine Chapel. The Florentine Renaissance was well under way, but the start of the wider European Renaissance is usually dated to 1519, the year of Leonardo’s death and the birth of Catherine de’ Medici (in Florence). That anniversary is the reason I’ve come to walk between the city and its neighbour, Siena, the second one-time powerhouse of western civilisation. Can there be a better moment to trumpet the news that dark ages can give way to renaissance?After breakfast, a short taxi ride takes me to my starting point at Greve in Chianti – at first I walk past vineyards and olive groves but am soon in the forest. From a high point, I get an idea of what lies ahead: a landscape ided equally by forest and cultivation, the latter mostly in the valleys or lower slopes, the former cloaking ridges and rounded peaks. The paths are gravel tracks, rising and falling gently as I head south. Occasionally, a motor bike passes. Otherwise, I see no one. I’m glad I filled my coffee flask before leaving Florence.It is much wilder than I’d anticipated: deer tracks pepper the mud and the grassy forest glades have been roughed up by gangs of wild boar. I spot the print of a very large paw: dog or wolf? The Tuscan wolf has been making a comeback in recent years, but they are extremely shy. I pick up porcupine quills, too. Italy is the only European home to this animal, an introduction by the Romans, who liked to eat them. The porcupine, which grows to a whopping metre long, has taken revenge ever since by devouring the sangiovese grapes that make chianti wines.In the late afternoon, I climb the ridge atop which Radda in Chianti is sited and suddenly emerge in a gorgeous Tuscan town: narrow stone streets, tiny shops, and flourishes of ancient ornamentation in stone.At the far end, I find the Hotel Vignale, home to a great restaurant, a sort of temple dedicated to the steak. Before dinner I swim in the unheated outdoor pool. “Are you crazy? It’s under 20 degrees!” says Luigi, the dining room’s high priest. Dinner arrives sizzling on a trolley and Luigi wields the knife. It is simply the best steak I’ve ever tasted, although certainly not the cheapest. At the next table, Luigi gently persuades a pair of American visitors that ordering it “well done” will not be a good idea.The next morning, I continue southwards. The vineyards are all fortified with hefty high barriers and electric fences. Five wolves were sighted three days ago, I’m informed, but these defences are against deer and boar. I pass beautiful churches, all locked, and some farmhouses, but then enter an oak forest. Porcupine quills are scattered among the acorns and I can hear a deep grunting noise from up the valley. Porcupine party? Wild boar? I listen. Each episode of grunts is followed by a delicate rattling, like sticks clashing. The deer are fighting.I leave the path and creep up the hillside, weaving through dense thickets of coppiced trees. I spot a nose, a rump, a giant antler, a leg. The breeze is on my face. I go on all fours, inching my way forwards into a position behind a log where I crouch, unmoving, for a long time. The forest is so thick that I have yet to see an entire deer. Suddenly a big black male is charging through the trees towards me. I try to stand up, but my left leg has gone to sleep and I roll sideways. The big male thunders past. Has he seen me? Then I hear the rival somewhere down below. The big male pauses, breathing heavily, then sprints away downhill. The twenty-strong herd melts silently into the forest. My heart rate returns to normal and I hobble back to the footpath.I wonder if the wolf had prompted this midnight swim?“No, the lupi never come to the village.”He pours me a glass of chianti classico and I take it to the terrace of my ground floor room that opens out on a lovely garden and pool. The village is surrounded by vineyards and is totally peaceful. That evening, Maurizio serves me and a pair of his friends a typical Tuscan dinner in his cave of a dining room: bruschetta, bean soup, meat course and dessert, followed by “a little grappa”. It feels like I’ve been absorbed into Tuscan family life. The hotel’s dachshund trots in with a stick. Maurizio gestures despairingly: “Chloe!? How many times must I tell you?” Chloe trots out, leaving the stick on the stone-flagged floor.Later, Maurizio shows me a book about the palio, the Siena horse race that dates back to medieval times, but our discussions are hampered because, after several glasses of chianti and the grappa, I can only speak a mongrel trade language stewed up from substandard Spanish, schoolboy French and half-witted Arabic. Not only that, Maurizio is forgetting his English. Chloe trots in with a stick. “Chloe! Quante volte devo dirti?” Chloe trots out.Next day, I reluctantly drag myself away from San Sano for the final section into Siena. Now the deep, silent forests are replaced with more vineyards, olive groves and graceful houses. I reach my hotel, the elegant Villa Scacciapensieri, but it is still a 3km walk to the centre. I decide to borrow a bike.It is a new bike, hardly used, and I soon discover why: Siena is built on several steep-sided hills that defy pedalling. Having said that, I do think a bike is a time-saver as the free-wheeling descents are rapid, and exhilarating.In the centre of the town, I come across huge crowds of people, everyone wearing a brightly coloured neckerchief and clutching a glass. I ask what’s happening. “It’s the palio,” a man informs me.“But I thought it was only in July and August?” I’m here in October.The man grins. “It’s a special one – to commemorate the end of the first world war. Most of us haven’t even sobered up from August.” Only now do I realise what Maurizio had been trying to tell me: the palio is on today.I can hear the roar of the crowd and, over heads, spot a blur of movement. The palio, I’m sure, is worth seeing, but anyone without a ticket needs to be in position very early to get any kind of view. Later, as I explore the narrow streets, I hear the clip-clop of hooves on cobbles and a horse is led past me followed by a crowd of excited fans. In a small square, tables are laid out for a feast. Each area of the city is decked with its flags and delivers full-blooded support for its horse and rider.Every bar and restaurant is packed. I stand in a corner with an espresso and absorb the feverish excitement. It’s worth being in Siena on palio day just to be part of this: an atmosphere that Renaissance greats like da Vinci and Michaelangelo must have known intimately.When I’ve had enough, I push the bike to the cathedral, an exquisite masterpiece of marble and mosaic filled with sculpted light, a worthy finale to a Renaissance walk.• The trip was provided by Inn Travel, which has an eight-night walking holiday between Florence and Siena from £1,295, including accommodation, breakfasts, three dinners, a picnic, transfers and walking notes but not flights.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

The face of the Democratic party was a 45-year-old black woman from the deep south.After Donald Trump delivered the State of the Union address, Stacey Abrams offered her party’s rebuttal. It is usually one of the more thankless tasks in American politics, blamed for nipping many a career in the bud. Abrams succeeded in turning it into an unofficial audition for future office.Governor of Georgia? US senator? Vice-President? President? All are potentially on the table, now or in the years to come.Jean-Pierre, a veteran of Barack Obama’s election campaigns, added: “Democrats are not going to win by jumping in the mud with Donald Trump. We’re going to win by offering up policies and a different vision for the country. She did that well. Her message was spot on. We are going to be seeing a lot more of her. She’d be a strong candidate for any office. Where ever Stacey is going next, count me in.”As the first African American woman to deliver the rebuttal, Abrams offered a vivid contrast from two years ago. Then, former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear, a grey-haired white man joined by mostly white people in a diner, gave the Democratic response to Trump’s first address.Abrams spoke from a union hall in Atlanta, with a erse audience including activists, educators and labour leaders. She dismissed the recent 35-day partial government shutdown as a “stunt” engineered by Trump.“America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants – not walls,” she said.Abrams emerged as a rising star in last year’s election for governor of Georgia, a Republican stronghold where she came agonisingly close to an upset. She eventually abandoned the race without a formal concession, asserting that her opponent, Brian Kemp, used his post as secretary of state to make it harder for people of colour to vote. She has since launched an effort to combat voter suppression, highlighted in Tuesday’s address.Abrams also has compelling biography. One of six siblings who grew up in segregated Jim Crow Mississippi, she studied law at Yale and became a leader in the Georgia state legislature. She is also the award-winning author of eight romantic suspense novels, under the pen name Selena Montgomery, and tweeted this week that her favourite Doctor Who was Tom Baker.Soon after her rebuttal began, Dan Pfeiffer, co-host of Pod Save America and former senior adviser to Obama, tweeted: “Stacey Abrams should run for President.”A subsequent New York Times article was headlined: “Stacey Abrams Isn’t Running for President. Should She Be?” Some observers believe she deserves just as much hype as Beto O’Rourke, who narrowly lost a Senate race in a red state, Texas, last November.There is no evidence to suggest Abrams will run, but Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is reportedly trying to persuade her to aim for Senate in 2020, sensing a chance to flip a Republican seat. Alternatively, she might wait for another chance to take on Kemp for governor, in 2022. Or she could become a formidable running mate for whoever emerges from the crowded Democratic field.Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: “Clearly she’s capable of reaching out very successfully to a broad coalition and stirring up real enthusiasm in her base. She has an affirmative personality. She tells a story rooted squarely in religion and tradition. She wasn’t running against America in any way. She was firm but not angry.”Long a “red state”, Georgia could become competitive in 2020 and Abrams could give Democrats an edge. But according to the unwritten rules of American politics, her prospects depend on the gender and race of the Democratic nominee. Notwithstanding that white men have long dominated the presidency and vice-presidency, conventional wisdom suggests that certain voters are not ready for two women or two people of colour on one ticket.If, for example, Senator Kamala Harris of California is the nominee, there is “zero chance” she will choose Abrams as her running mate, Galston argued.“It would not be a strategic calculation to reach out to a broader electorate. The political logic points strongly in the opposite direction.”But in the event of a white man being the party’s standard bearer, Abrams could be the pragmatic choice as Democrats pursue a base far more erse than that of Republicans. Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “I would lay odds on it being an African American, and possibly an African American woman.”Other analysts agreed. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: “Let’s say, for whatever reason, Joe Biden or Beto O’Rourke gets the nomination. They’re white and male and they’re naturally going to look for balance. Let’s say they’ve had a particularly nasty encounter with Kamala Harris in one of the primary debates: they might see Stacey Abrams as a good option.”Abrams might prefer to keep her powder dry for a re-run for governor, however.“It would make the most sense for her,” Sabato said. “She came so close and Brian Kemp is not impressive. In four years, Georgia will have evolved further: it used to be red but is going purple.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc018a94316506e38b9ae7ea40f54164428be72/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c596ff3d130f91739ec8d792a56ca3da","title":"who really are the gilets jaunes","story":"The gilets jaunes movement is the longest-running protest in France since the second world war. It has lasted for 13 weeks but has mobilised fully for only 13 days – all of them Saturdays.In the protesters’ own eyes, this is not a protest. It is an insurrection which happens mostly at the weekends. Through a series of Saturday putsches, the yellow vests hope not merely to bring down President Emmanuel Macron but to rip up the constitution of the Fifth Republic and replace representative democracy with popular government. Their support, always limited compared with previous French rebellions, is waning. They will not give up easily or soon. They are mostly peaceful, but acts and words of great violence are committed and spoken.There is no simple explanation for the gilets jaunes. It is not a monolithic, single-minded movement. It has no leadership structure, no single, accepted programme of demands. That’s what makes it fascinating. And worrying.In May last year, a young businesswoman of French West Indian origin, Priscillia Ludosky, 31, placed a petition online complaining about the high cost of petrol and diesel in France. Reaction – practically nothing. Ludosky is a calm young woman with dreadlocks who runs her own cosmetics business from home. She is an unlikely pioneer for a populist movement which is sometimes accused of being racist and far right (as parts of it undoubtedly are).In October she was contacted by Eric Drouet, a 33-year-old lorry driver, who teamed up with her to promote her original petition. Drouet is a car fanatic, a “petrol head”, but also someone with extremist political tendencies. He is now, many weeks later, probably the most influential figure in the gilets jaunes.There is confusion in France about whether he should be seen as far right or far left. Drouet’s original motivation may well have been his car obsession rather than his politics. Pre-gilets jaunes, he was a loud-mouthed young man more likely to watch Top Gear than to read Das Kapital or Mein Kampf.By the time he intervened, petrol prices were spiking because of a rise in world oil prices. Ludosky’s original petition exploded online, attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures.It was Drouet, from Melun in the brie cheese country east of Paris, who thought of the idea of a nationwide protest against fuel taxes on 17 November. Someone else had the brilliant PR idea of dressing everyone up in the yellow hi-vis vests that French motorists must by law carry in their cars. Petrol prices rapidly set alight other grievances in rural and outer suburban France, some concrete, some more existential: a lack of public services, the high cost of living, a new tax on some pensions, the fact that Macron had partially abolished a tax on wealth. No one should underestimate the importance of a decision last July to reduce the two-lane speed limit in France from 90kph to 80kph.This aroused a long-simmering belief in “peripheral France” that the countryside and outer suburbs are somehow subsidising the insolent success of the cities. Speeding fines, in this rural view, are just another way of taxing ploucs or pecnos – yokels or rednecks. There is also a belief that lower and middle France is taxed unfairly in favour of the rich.Both beliefs are factually untrue. If anything, the rich subsidise the public services of the poor and lower-middle. The metropolitan areas subsidise peripheral France.But it is true that energy, life and local sources of wealth have been sucked out of large swathes of France in recent decades – as they have in parts of Britain or the United States. All this adds up to an existential conviction that peripheral France is not only being left behind but mocked and cheated by those who are forging ahead. I believe that this resentment – a sense of being slighted or ignored or despised or abandoned or humiliated – explains the yellow-vest movement more than any particular grievance.The first day of action on 17 November mobilised 283,000 people across France. This figure has never been reached since. It was impressive but fell well below the numbers that have turned out for other social protests in the last 20 years. Its significance was that it took place not just in cities but also in small towns and on almost every local roundabout. Like the Tour de France, it was a national event which came “down your way”.People who had previously felt powerless felt abruptly powerful because they could hold up cars and lorries at a roundabout. People who had been invisible became highly visible in their hi-vis vests.Here is our second paradox. The gilets jaunes are an internet-spawned and driven movement. They could not have existed before Facebook existed. But their attraction is that they are also something tangible, a social club as well as a social protest.The gilets jaunes were brought to a white-heat pitch of anger by the halls of facing mirrors of “anger groups” online. But they also allowed people to escape from the isolation of their terminals or smartphones to come together and do things.The 17 November protests – Act One – were mostly peaceful. There was little violence, except a few scuffles with police in Paris and with motorists on blocked roundabouts. The government stood back and allowed the protests to happen, even though the gilets jaunes deliberately defied the law which demands advance permissions for large gatherings.It is important to remember this when gilets jaunes and Russian news sites allege that Macron has tried to “suppress” the movement.On 24 November, Act Two of the movement, there was some violence in Paris. Police responded robustly to being attacked by a militant fringe of protesters on the Champs-Élysées. There were several serious injuries from police weapons. This was treated on GJ sites as deliberate police violence and repression, stoking tempers for the next weekend.On 1 December, Act Three, I was out on streets of Paris from early morning. I happen to live near the Arc de Triomphe, and when I left my building at 9am I walked out into the middle of a street battle. A number of yellow vests – not just hard left and right militants but rural or provincial disaffected men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s – attacked police from early morning.The Arc de Triomphe was tagged with graffiti. Police were pelted with acid, paint, iron bolts, stones and bottles. Buildings around the Étoile were set briefly alight. A mob surged down the Avenue Kléber, overturning and burning cars and smashing bank, shop and restaurant windows.Before the next Saturday – Act Four on 8 December – there were dark reports that there would be an insurrection, using live weapons and explosives. Macron, shaken, visited the Élysée nuclear bunker to make sure there was a place that he could take refuge. In the event, 8 December was again a violent day – not just in Paris but in several cities. It was not the feared revolution. The violence this time was mostly provoked by militia of the hard right and hard left. Some “ordinary” GJs waded in. Police were more aggressive in their response.Since then there have been nine further Acts or Saturday putsches, some more violent than others, some better supported than others. Violence has switched from Paris for the most part to provincial cities, especially Toulouse, Bordeaux, Caen, Rouen and Rennes. The numbers taking part have fallen to around 60,000.There has been no systematic attempt to repress protest. But the police’s so-called defensive weapons – rubber bullets and stun grenades – have become a serious problem that the government has been too slow to recognise. Seventeen eyes and four hands have been lost so far. That is unacceptable, whoever is initially responsible for the violence.Is this just the French being the French? Not really. It’s true that protest goes to the street in France more rapidly than in almost any other democratic country. There is a default position in the country that social demands will not be taken seriously without street demos, and demos will not be taken seriously without a dose of violence.But there is also something very un-French about the gilets jaunes movement. It has, first of all, broken all the unspoken and spoken rules of French manifestations. Protests are usually choreographed within certain limits, with agreed venues and routes and marshals. Riots happen but they are predictable riots.The gilets jaunes refused from the beginning to be bound by any of these rules, although this is now changing. The movement, supposedly peaceful, allowed its own violent fringe as well as opportunist, urban, state-hating militia of hard right and hard left to take over.The violence is not limited to the Saturdays-only protests in French cities. There have been scores of arson and other attacks on the offices of MPs who support Macron. There have been attacks on motorways toll-booths, newspapers and radio stations. A starred restaurant whose boss criticised the gilets jaunes was burned. Town halls, prefectures and other public buildings have been vandalised. The gilets jaunes are also un-French – or at least atypical – because they have not come from the usual or expected sources of protest: unions, farmers, students, the multi-racial banlieues. They come from a section of French society that is usually invisible, permanently grumpy but little engaged in politics.I mean rural, non-farming France, small town France, outer suburban France. I mean many people who have not voted for years, as well as many who have voted hard right or hard left.Gilets jaunes do include people at the bottom of society, the unemployed, the marginalised, but more typically they are people who are above the bottom but think that they should be doing better. They are people with low-paid jobs or pensioners or artisans or small business people or technicians or people at the lower level of the caring professions.This mixture of supporters explains in part the heterogenous character and demands of the movement, which point both left and right, to higher welfare payments and pensions but also to lower taxes, to less state and more state. There is no coherent ideology, even a refusal of ideology.Some see this as a camouflage for a movement whose heart beats on the far right. But many of the usual far-right hot topics – migration, Islam, abortion, gay marriage, Europe – are not the first things that you hear on the lips of gilets jaunes.What are the sources of grievance and how justified are they? Here it is difficult to prise apart French and un-French elements.The words you hear most often are mépris and ras le bol. Mépris means contempt. Gilets jaunes are convinced or have been convinced that the little or middling people like them are held in contempt by the trendy, rich, globally-oriented people of successful metropolitan France.That’s why, I think, Macron has sparked such anger and hatred: not so much for what he has done in the past 20 months but for what he represents and some of the things he has said. He typifies the kind of person that GJs didn’t like even before they were GJs or before there was Macron.He is the embodiment of the rich, clever, self-replicating people from the governing classes who’ve been to the finishing schools of the governing elite and think they know everything.And so to the second word or phrase you hear: ras le bol, which means sick to the teeth. It conveys a sense of having been pushed to the breaking point. In my experience, French people almost always have a sense of ras le bol about something or other. But the white-hot anger of the GJ movement is something new and different. It can only be explained, I think, by the silos of facing mirrors of social media sites, which fill heads with exaggerated versions of real grievances blended with complete bullshit.“France has been sold to the UN” “Alsace has been given back to Germany” “Politicians are living high on the hog – if we sweep them away, we can have lower taxes and higher welfare payments” “Brigitte Macron, as first lady, earns €550,000 a year from the state”. Actually she earns, nothing, zero, rien.This nonsense is always accompanied, as it often is in the United States and Britain, by a message telling you that the mainstream media is lying. Thus suspicion of the media, already high, is cranked to the point where journalists, newspapers and radio stations have become targets for GJ violence.The gilets jaunes rapidly moved from a protest movement with specific demands to a revolutionary movement of unlikely revolutionaries. The view in much of the foreign media is that these are anti-Macron protests. And they are. But they go way beyond him and call for the sluicing out of the entire political class, left and right, even hard left and hard right, to be replaced by a bottom-up, direct democracy of permanent popular decisions by referendums.Thus we have a revolution which did not just start on the internet and Facebook but wants to use the internet to impose a new form of government and yet is at the same time anti-globalist and nostalgic for a simpler, more traditional kind of France. Yet another paradox.The movement is now splitting. Some gilets jaunes have decided to enter the mainstream political system to try to reform it or destroy it from the inside. Three rival GJ lists, broadly left, right and centrist, are being prepared for the European elections in May.An extraordinary diplomatic row exploded last week when the Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, arrived unannounced in the south Paris suburbs for a photo opportunity with one of these electoral lists.France withdrew its ambassador from Rome in protest. It emerged that Di Maio had been invited by Christophe Chalençon, a gilets jaunes figure with far-right connections, not by the leader of the list, Ingrid Vavasseur. She described both Di Maio and Chalençon as “sharks”.All of this may help Macron. He is already recovering strongly in the opinion polls as well-heeled, urban France turns to him to save them from yellow chaos. He has made €10bn of concessions to motorists and the low-paid. He has started a “great national debate” in hundreds of village and town meetings.Even one yellow vest list in the European elections will take votes from Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise. For Macron’s party to top the European poll in France would be a “mid-term” triumph.There is talk of Emmanuel Macron calling a referendum on the same day as the EU poll on 26May to take further wind from the sails of the gilets jaunes. This is probably a silly idea. Senior ministers are campaigning against it.If the referendum asks marginal questions – ie should there be fewer French MPs? – it will seem like a betrayal of the promise of Macron’s “great debate”. If it asks explosive questions – should Macron resign? Should he push ahead with his state-shrinking reform programme? – the results could be catastrophic for him.Vavasseur, an auxiliary nurse from Normandy, is one of the more thoughtful gilets jaunes (and therefore detested by many others). She is leading one of the GJ lists in the European elections. Asked to sum up yellow-vest demands in a single sentence, she said: “That we should feel recognised and valued.”The anger of the gilets jaunes is understandable. What is scary is their fury.

What explains the radicalisation of home carers and garage mechanics in small towns who don’t understand the basics of how their own country’s political and tax system works but want to tear them both down?That fury has many sources but its depth and strength can only be explained by the compound or viral effect of social media.

They’re rewarding people for taking measured and controlled risks. Whatever you do as far as the PAC is concerned it’s wrong . . . they’re creating a system where people do not want to come in to the public service anymore.“I believe the culture they have developed is doing real harm to public service in Ireland. I’m concerned if this carries on it will do real damage.”Asked to comment on calls for Minister for Health Simon Harris to step down from office over the cost overruns at the national children’s hospital, Mr O’Brien advised that the Government wait for the findings of the Price WaterhouseCoopers (PwC) review into the controversy rather than adding to the current “showboating” around it.“In a few weeks time there will be an objective report. I would argue it’s better to have that report than unseemly rush for headlines and airtime. . .It isn’t what the country needs.”Mr O’Brien said he did not believe “animosity” existed between the Department of Health and the HSE but that there was “confusion around accountability” and “duplication of activities”. Noting that he was appointed as HSE director at a time when the health service was set to be abolished within two years, he said there was always a risk that “things would fall between the cracks” as long as the body continued.Children’s hospital and nurses’ strikeHe argued that he never knew of the overrun in costs of the national children’s hospital as he had stepped down from his position in May 2018, a month before the HSE was told that the project was facing cost challenges. “My working presumption is that this was brought to the oversight board in June because that’s when it became a live issue,” he said. “If it had been a big issue in April I’m confident they would have brought it to the board in April.”Commenting on the ongoing dispute around nurses’ pay and conditions, Mr O’Brien said he held “pride” in the “tremendous work” of nurses but that the health service was the “wrong shape” and that the nurses were continuing to strike because no “meaningful engagement” had been offered by the HSE.He said there had been very little momentum in the implementation of the SláinteCare plan and warned of “a significant problem” in the future around the State’s general practitioner (GP) services. “Our system is upside down, for years we’ve prioritised hospitals over primary care. I’m concerned that the most important medical relationship, which is our GP, is not necessarily going to be a relationship that people have in the future. I’m worried that without intervention we could be looking at the last generation of family doctors. And if we lose family doctors we’re going to lose the game.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Clare Bailey says Brexit and lack of progress on equality impacting lives across NorthPsychiatric Nurses Association and INMO attending talks on Saturday in bid to avert further strikesIrish funding in fight to end AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria rises to \u0026euro45 millionTony O\u0026rsquoBrien accuses Public Accounts Committee of creating a \u0026lsquoculture of bullying\u0026rsquoSuspect (42) being questioned over paramilitary-style shooting in Creggan area of cityConstruction inflation on brownfield city-centre sites higher than on greenfield sitesTaoiseach says he understands taxpayers \u0026lsquovery annoyed\u0026rsquo about cost overrunCourt told man made threats to kill after mother refused to let drug addict friend stayNumber of past alleged abusers identified by Scouting Ireland increases to 237Private dinner meeting described as \u0026lsquowarm\u0026rsquo by aides also focused on stalled NI assemblyStudent debate whether to ban imports from Israeli settlements in Palestinian territoryEvent on the future of European democracy hears concern in advance of electionsTwo passengers taken to University Hospital LimerickMan (35) left with \u0026lsquopotentially life-changing injury\u0026rsquo following attack on Friday eveningLabelling of foreign chicken \u0026lsquomade in Wicklow\u0026rsquo is lawful, says Food Safety AuthorityLabour Court talks between INMO and health managers to continue on SaturdaySettlement agreed after claim law required assessment within 3 months of applicationCompany portrays itself as Irish but doesn\u0026rsquot fly the Irish flag, Siptu saysJury watches video of Kilkee murder accused\u0026rsquos interviews with garda\u0026iacute"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3788316.1549726395!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tens of thousands rally in support of nurses in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople attend a rally in support of striking nurses in Dublin city centre on Saturday. Photograph: Alan BetsonTens of thousands of people attended a rally in Dublin city centre in support of the nurses’ campaign for pay improvements to tackle recruitment and retention issues. Over 40,000 members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) and Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) are set to go on strike for three days in the coming week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Nurses and their families and supporters gathered at Parnell Square from noon and began marching down O’Connell Street chanting and carrying trade union banners at about 12.30pm. Noreen Galvin, a clinical nurse manager based in Tullamore Hospital, said she came to Dublin to support the protest because it was about the future of the nursing profession.“It’s about recruitment, it’s about retention. In my unit the vast majority of nurses are in their 40s and 50s. The 20 and the 30-year-olds they are not here, they’re not in Ireland. One of my colleagues, her daughter qualified last year. Twenty of them are in London and around the world. So it is about safe staffing, it is about safe patient care. Every day procedures are cancelled because there aren’t enough nurses.” The protest moved down Eden Quay and across the Liffey, up Lombard Street and Westland Row to Merrion Street where a stage was erected for speakers in front of Government Buildings. Addressing the huge crowd, INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that in 2019 there were no further arguments left to deny nurses and midwives equal pay.“Equal pay for nurses with other graduates is something we have strived for, is something that we seek and it’s something that we intend to get, because without it, nursing and midwifery will still be considered a little bit of a vocation and a little bit of ‘girls going to work’ and girls just not having the right to stand up for themselves.”Ms Ní Sheaghdha said nurses were not denying there were problems with the economic fabric of the State or that the economic future of the country was important.But she said they did not believe that our social fabric was secondary and that our public health service was something that should be sacrificed in a recession. Ms Ní Sheaghdha said she was returning to the Labour Court, where the INMO has been in talks with health managers. The Psychiatric Nurses Association on Friday escalated its campaign of industrial action over pay and staffing issues and announced three further 24-hour work stoppages for the week after next.Peter Hughes, general secretary of the union, told the crowds at the protest on Saturday that by 2021, 34 per cent of psychiatric nurses in the State would be eligible for retirement. He also said that asome 3,000 children were on waiting lists for first-time mental health assessments and that this was “a national disgrace”. The PNA said it had not been invited to attend talks at the Labour Court on Friday between the INMO and public service management aimed at finding a resolution to the current dispute. Talks between public service management and the INMO will resume at 3.30pm on Saturday and a meeting with the PNA will commence at 5.30pm. On Friday the HSE formally wrote to the Government expressing concern over patient safety issues in the event of the planned three days of strikes by nurses going ahead in the coming week.

So it should probably have been Ukexit but Brexit trips off the tongue better.Peter Wilding, the managing director of the British Influence think tank, is credited with coining the term Brexit. Wilding was former Conservative party leader David Cameron’s media and policy director of the Conservative Party in the EU from 2005 to 2008.Wilding, who campaigned for the UK to remain within the EU, first used the phrase in 2012 before it was first used publicly by Cameron. Brexit is a first cousin, once removed, of Grexit, which was used to describe Greece’s possible departure from the euro zone during the economic crisis.David who? David Cameron is the former Conservative Party leader and British prime minister. He romped home with a big majority in 2015 riding a wave of a promise he gave to Tory hardliners to hold an inout referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The feeling is\u0026nbspneither he, nor anyone else, really believed the vote would pass. His election victory is now a distant memory. Cameron is rarely seen but is sometimes spotted avoiding members of the media as he jumps into a black Range Rover. Or as Eastenders star Danny Dyer put it, Cameron, who he labelled a “twat”, was in France “with his trotters up” while everybody else was dealing with the Brexit calamity.Theresa May - Ok, so unless you’ve been living under a large rock with no wifi, you’ll know that Theresa May is the Conservative Party leader and current British prime minister. At least as long as nobody else on the planet wants the job. She became British prime minister\u0026nbspin July 2016 in the wake of the Brexit vote and the resignation of Cameron. May who will be 63 in October 2019, was first elected an MP for Maidenhead in 1997 and served as British home secretary (basically, our minister for justice) from 2010 to 2016.Article 50 - This is the “get out clause” of the Treaty of Lisbon. It grants an EU member state the power to quit the bloc unilaterally. Once triggered, it gives the departing country two years to negotiate an exit deal. Theresa May triggered the UK’s exit on March 29th, 2017, scheduling Brexit for 11pm on March 29th, 2019, and starting the countdown clock. A European Court of Justice ruling has said the UK can unilaterally withdraw its article 50 application but extending it, thereby postponing the exit, would require unanimous agreement from the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government.The Withdrawal Agreement - This is the deal reached in November 2018 between May and the European Union on the terms under which Britain would exit the EU. Also known as the “WA”, the “orce deal” and “Theresa May’s deal” it includes a transition period of two years (and possibly longer) after Britain leaves when not much would change. It also contains a provision called the backstop that will kick in to keep the Irish Border open in the event that trading and border arrangements sufficient to achieve this aren’t reached during the transition period.Apart from the backstop, the key issues it covers are the mutual rights of EU and UK citizens now living in each other’s territory and the UK’s financial obligations to the EU (often referred to the the “orce bill”). It is not yet ratified as it is facing strong opposition in the House of Commons. The European Parliament also needs to approve it.The Political Declaration - This is a separate document also agreed in November 2018 between the two sides setting out how they hoped the future relationship will develop in key areas including trade, political and security co-operation and so on. Unlike the withdrawal agreement, this is a political (not a legal) document. So it could be tweaked to try to bring the UK parliament on side.Backstop: The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement, is a kind of insurance policy that will kick in to ensure that there is no hard border in Ireland, no matter what the outcome is of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The agreement involves a transition period, a kind of standstill when most current arrangements would apply until the end of 2020, at least. It can be extended up to the end of 2022. If a trade deal between the EU and UK is not finalised in this time or is not far-reaching enough to ensure that no border checks are needed, then the backstop kicks in. It would involve the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU and the North also sticking to some of the rules and regulations set down in the EU single market. Both sides say they want to avoid using the backstop, or if it is triggered to ensure this only happens for a short period. The term comes from cricket it is a fielding position where the backstop stands behind the wicket-keeper to stop the ball reaching the boundary and prevent the batting team from scoring should the wicket-keeper miss it.Transition period: This is the standstill period which would start immediately the UK leaves on March 29th under the withdrawal agreement. The UK would remain in the EU trading bloc - as a member of the single market and customs union and the rights of business and citizens would remain. The transition period - sometimes referred to by the UK government as the implementation period - would last at least until December 2020. There is scope to extend it until December 2022, at the latest. Brexit supporters don’t like it as it would keep the UK tied to EU laws, but with no say in how these are changed.No-deal Brexit: This means the UK leaving at the end of March- or at some later date if an extension is agreed - without the withdrawal agreement being ratified. This would mean that all the UK’s legal links to the EU would end overnight, new trading rules and regulatory regimes would come into effect immediately. It has led to warnings of economic chaos for the UK and Ireland and more widely in some sectors such as car manufacturing.The EU Single Market - The body of rules, regulations and practices designed to allow free movement of people, capital, goods and services across the EU.The EU Customs Union - The agreement that goods can move freely within the EU with no tariffs, or special import taxes, being applied as they move from one country to another. It also involves common agreed tariff levels on goods coming into the union from outside - meaning that once they enter the EU they too can also circulate freely.Brexit lingo - the everyday phrases\u0026nbspBrexiters - these are simply people in favour of Brexit. Brexiteers are Brexiters, but not necessarily the other way around.Brexiteers - If Brexit and the Three Musketeers had a love child it would be a Brexiteer. The term is used to describe those who are fervently in favour of Brexit to the point, perhaps, where they would carry a sword to make their point. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are Brexiteers, although we are in no way suggesting they would resort to violence to further their cause.Arch Brexiteer- A Brexiteer with a cherry on top, imagine if Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson had a love child with the Incredible Hulk’s angry sister.Remainer - Somebody who voted against the UK leaving the European Union. Can sometimes be heard apologising to the Irish nation on radio and television news programmes or sitting in tears in a hipster cafe in central London reading Fintan O’Toole’s latest  column.Remoaner - A derogatory term used by Brexiters, Brexiteers or Arch Brexiteers to describe a Remainer. Calling someone a remoaner is up there with calling your female work colleague a nag.Red Lines - Issues where compromise is not an option. Everyone from the Democratic Unionist Party to the Dublin Government to the British government to the Conservative party hardliners to the European Union itself have their own favourite red lines. There are so many red lines, it very quickly after June 2016 began to look like a big bowl of spaghetti and red pesto. There is a lot of talk now, in particular, about whether Theresa May will move any of her “red lines” to try the break the logjam and win House of Commons support for her deal.Strong and stable - British prime minister Theresa May called a snap election in April 2017 saying the UK needed a “strong and stable” government because of Brexit. It is an expression she would live to regret after she lost her majority and was forced to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The DUP are among the most vociferously opposed to the withdrawal agreement Theresa May negotiated with the EU and to the backstop. The institutions expected to guarantee strong and stable society in the UK and other democracies are now very weak and unstable.Brino or Bino - “Brexit in name only” is the position the United Kingdom might find itself in if it were to leave the EU on terms dictated to it whereby the country must align itself to such an extent that it would operate in almost the same fashion as if it were inside the EU. So it would have left the European Union but would be still subject to the same trading rules and legal obligations. Bino is the worst case scenario for those who want Brexit.Irexit - A second cousin of both Brexit and Grexit, this describes Ireland’s exit from the European Union, which of course if very unlikely to happen any time in the near future. The most recent Eurobarometer survey shows Irish people to be more than happy with EU membership, notwithstanding our relationship with European authorities during the economic crash.Regrexit: The feeling of regret and guilt for voting in favour of Brexit. The phenomenon was felt as soon as the morning after the vote in June 2016 as it is thought many voted for Brexit as a protest against other issues with the assumption it would not pass. Doh!Nebulous - What Theresa May accused European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker of calling her during a Brussels showdown in December. That’s according to lip-readers. He was calling “the British position” nebulous, he insisted. The whole episode was caught on camera and the entire world collectively wished Mammy and Daddy would stop arguing. Explaining the episode afterwards May said: “I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.Nebulous (2) - Lady Sylia Hermon described the proposals in an amendment supported by Theresa May’s government to come up with an “alternative” to the backstop as nebulous.Hard border - This refers to the situation where border checkpoints by police andor soldiers would be erected to regulate the movement of people and goods between the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be in the EU and Northern Ireland, which will remain in the UK and therefore outside the European Union. The idea strikes fear into the hearts of most people on the island of Ireland and many in Britain given how much a target border infrastructure was for paramilitaries during the Troubles. Not to mention the disruption a hard border would cause to everyday life in border communities. The backstop was set up specifically to avoid the hard border.Soft or frictionless border - This describes how the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland operates now. People can move freely back and forth without even knowing which jurisdiction they are in. Think leaving Forkhill to visit your Aunty Mary in Dundalk without getting stopped by a soldier to ask what’s in the boot of your car. Goods can move freely too, with no hindrance or checks, though there are police operations against smuggling.The buzzwords\u0026nbspSecond referendum - This is a mechanism deployed in Ireland several times, designed to allow people who feel regrexit to have another bite at the cherry. Those who want a second vote say the electorate was led down the garden path the first time around, while those against it say the people have already spoken. If a second referendum were to be held it remains unclear which side would win. Remember that snap UK election Theresa May called in 2017 seeking a strong mandate from the people? They ended up with a lame duck administration propped up by the arch-Brexiteer Democratic Unionist Party. Dealing with the electorate is like trying to herd cats - anything could happen.Unless and until - The phrase used many, many times, to describe how long the provisions of the backstop would stay in place, i.e. unless or until there is an agreement that ensures no hard border in Ireland. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has been saying it at the drop of a hat. For Brexiters, Brexiteers and arch Brexiteers it is the proverbial nails on the Brexit blackboard.Time-limited backstop - A key problem in the UK parliament with the backstop plan is that – after the transition period – it commits the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU until another solution is found to the Irish border issue. For this reason there are demands to put a time-limit on the backstop. However, for Ireland and the EU this goes against the “ unless and until” commitment.Alternative arrangements - The UK argues that there are other ways to control goods flowing across the Irish border, apart from physical infrastructure. And so these are alternatives to the backstop . These include advanced customs processes and the use of specialist technology to monitor the movement of goods. The EU has promised in the draft withdrawal agreement to assess alternatives to the backstop with the UK, but has pointed out that there is no border anywhere between two trading zones where some checks do not take place .Maxfac - Maximum facilitation or “maxfac” is a phrase often used by Brexiteers to describe the idea that technology and customs processes can be used to avoid a hard border with infrastructure.The Malthouse Proposal - a plan which has found support in the Conservative Party late in the day, for the UK to exit the EU and replace the backstop with a free-trade deal with the EU combined with the use of technology to do away with customs checks. It also proposes to extend the standstill transition period until the end of 2021. It sounds like it was dreamt up in a pub but in fact it was brokered by housing minister Kit Malthouse.SoftSofter Brexit - It had been thought that Theresa May, following the rejection of her original deal in the House of Commons, might try to reach agreement on a softer version of Brexit. A softer Brexit would mean the UK remaining more closely aligned to EU rules and regulations and probably also remaining in a customs union with the EU. However there has as yet been no effort to reach this kind of deal with Labour, whose support May would need to get this over the line in the House of Commons.Canada ++ - This is the idea that the UK would end up, after Brexit, in a free trade deal with the EU similar to the one completed with Canada but hopefully involving an even closer relationship (hence, plus, or plus plus). The trading arrangements between the two sides are only due to be negotiated after Brexit takes place. If there is a no-deal Brexit and no agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves, it is not clear what the options will be for future negotiations.Norway - A Scandinavian country’s name but also used to describe the way Norway trades and relates to the European Union. The Norway model might be considered Bino by Brexiters as it would involve staying in the EU single market and subject to its rules (though overseen by a separate court). Norway-plus is sometimes used to refer to a Norway-style deal with additional membership of a customs union with the EU. This would solve the Irish Border problem but would be too close a relationship for the Brexiteers.WTO rules - If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then it will trade with the EU and everyone else – on the basis of rules set down by the World Trade Organisation. This would involve tariffs, or special import taxes, on goods moving in and out of the UK to EU and third country markets. The UK would hope to maintain existing trade links, negotiated by the EU, with many other countries and also to do a future trade deal with the EU. There is debate on whether, immediately after leaving, the UK would immediately invoke WTO rules. It is meant to deal with all countries with which it does not have a trade deal the same, but enforcement of this is via a long drawn-out disputes process.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: ReutersFrancois LenoirA crunch vote in which MPs could force Theresa May’s hand on Brexit is set to be delayed until the end of the month or even later, it has emerged.Under the timetable agreed by the government, the British prime minister must either present a revised Brexit deal to the commons next Thursday, which appears unlikely to happen, or else table a motion to which MPs can add amendments.In a similar process just over a week ago, the commons supported Mrs May’s attempt to renegotiate the Irish backstop but voted down amendments tabled by cross-party alliances of Brexit-sceptic MPs that would have extended article 50 and given parliament more control.It had been expected the MPs would try again on Thursday if Mrs May did not return with a deal. But sources close to the group, led by the Tory MP Nick Boles and Labour’s Yvette Cooper, said it seemed likely that the prime minister would be given more time to discuss a Labour Brexit proposal and hold more talks with Brussels.“The Tory MPs are keen to give the PM a chance to follow up on the cross-party talks, and negotiations with the EU,” the source said. A Bill laying out how MPs could seek to avoid a no-deal departure might nonetheless be published next week, they said.“There’s a definite sense that lots of Tories are worried about no deal, but they don’t want to look like they are trying to obstruct her negotiations,” the source said. “There is very definitely a majority in parliament against no deal, but it’s a question of how to proceed and when.The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who supported the last Cooper-Boles amendment, told the : “Our position is that the ball is in the PM’s court. What we do depends on what the PM does.”Any further delay would be contingent on Mrs May promising a future date for either a vote on her deal or another amendable motion, he said, adding: “Parliament has to have its say.”It sets the scene for an increasingly tense couple of weeks in which Mrs May will attempt to stitch together a Brexit plan that can get a parliamentary majority while the EU and backbenchers watch the clock tick down towards March 29th.After a bruising set of talks in Brussels on Thursday in which the European Council president Donald Tusk mentioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals as a way of breaking the impasse, Mrs May was meeting the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for a dinner in Dublin on Friday night.Mrs May has yet to formally respond to Mr Corbyn’s letter on Wednesday in which he said Labour would support her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments, including joining a customs union.Separately, Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage announced on Friday that he would stand as a candidate for a new “Brexit Party” to contest European Parliament elections if Britain’s departure from the EU is delayed past March 29th.“The party was founded with my full support and with the intention of fighting the European elections on May 23rd if Brexit has not been delivered by then,” the former Ukip leader wrote in an opinion piece published by the Daily . – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3786910.1549637301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland and belfast agreement secure us support ahead of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney (centre) with members of the Friends of Ireland caucus inside the Ways and Means committee room in the US Capitol building in Washington on Thursday.

On the agenda was Brexit.Concern among Irish-Americans about the potential impact of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement have spilled out into the open in recent weeks.Following congressman Brendan Boyle’s introduction of a resolution to Congress opposing the imposition of a hard border in Ireland last week, 40 senior Irish-Americans, including five former US ambassadors, wrote to prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, outlining their alarm at the direction of Brexit.On Wednesday, at a reception to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, Neal and Republican congressman Peter King warned that Britain’s hope of striking a trade deal with the US after Brexit could be on the rocks if the Belfast Agreement is compromised by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.“If the British want to consider any type of trade agreement with the United States it is important that the soft border is maintained. What influence we have, we will use it,” King said.Of more concern to London will be Neal’s warning that concerns about the Belfast Agreement will “weigh on his mind” as the committee considers a future trade deal.As the chair of the Ways and Means committee, Neal, who was centrally involved in the Belfast Agreement 20 years ago, will have significant influence over the shape of any future US-UK trade agreement.The committee’s quaint-sounding name belies its power. It is one of the most powerful committees in Congress, overseeing financial and taxation matters including trade.This week, for example, it held its first hearing on getting access to presidential tax returns – a major source of concern for president Donald Trump.Strong Irish diasporaAs well as his meetings with Congress, Coveney also spoke to senior figures within the Trump administration this week including secretary of state Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, ensuring that Ireland’s concerns are understood within the administration.Britain remains a significant player in Washington with a formidable diplomatic presence and military might that cannot be underestimated. But Ireland continues to benefit from a strong diaspora and powerful Irish-American lobby.Nonetheless the future of the Irish-American lobby cannot be taken for granted, given the slowdown in Irish emigration to the US in recent decades.That is one reason why the Tánaiste this week launched the government’s new Americas strategy, part of the Department of Foreign Affairs’s “Global Ireland” drive. Its aim is to inject a “new dynamism and ambition” into Ireland’s relationship with the US.This involves beefing up Ireland’s presence in locations as erse as Miami, Los Angeles, and Austin, increasing the number of high-level government visits to the US to between 30 and 40 a year, and launching a new diaspora policy with particular emphasis on young people.Of perhaps most interest is the promise to “advance a strong, enduring partnership between the European Union and the United States”.Post-Brexit, Ireland will be an important pro-US voice around the EU table, particularly in terms of taxation, regulation and the digital economy. Ireland and the UK, along with the Benelux and other northern countries, have traditionally been the most vocal proponents of free trade and regulatory restraint in the EU.Britain’s imminent departure may tip the balance of the EU towards the more protectionist, and often anti-US, sentiment of large members like France. Given the huge levels of US foreign direct investment into Ireland, Irish officials and representatives of like-minded countries have become the de facto defenders of US interests when it comes to matters of trade and commerce in Brussels.Ireland may welcome the current surge in interest in Washington in the Brexit debate. But with the imminent departure of the UK, the US may find it needs Ireland more than ever in the corridors of power in Europe.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A rising hash rate will also raise concerns about bitcoin\u0027s environmental impact, with its electricity consumption estimated to be more than the country of Ireland.Other analysts had warned that a fall below $3,000 would have signalled a blood bath for bitcoin, as traders sought to offload the crashing cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Except it didn’t. We were delayed 28 hours.At first, as we waited in the lounge, no explanation was given. Then it was announced a faulty part had been discovered on a wing flap.

He treated the passengers like human beings, like grown-ups, describing how the wing flap was not operating properly when they tested it, and on inspection, a tiny bracket was found to have snapped. BA didn’t have one, but he was optimistic that Emirates did. It could be fitted fairly quickly, and we would soon be able to fly to London safely.After an hour it emerged Emirates did not have the part, after all.\u0026nbspKLM might, we were told. Before long, the captain was back to\u0026nbsptell us we would not be flying that night.\u0026nbspWe would have to wait 24 hours, for the bracket to be flown in from London, while BA would put\u0026nbspus up in hotels.British Airways celebrates 100 years with a retro paint jobSpanish Airways? BA seeks support from Spain amid Brexit anxietyAirlines that are on the EU’s banned listHe was calm, open and authoritative. As we clustered round he dealt clearly with all our queries. Nobody had any complaints. Thanks to the captain’s communication skills, the mood was one of good-humoured acceptance. He said he would see us the following evening, bade us farewell, apologised again, but stressed that our safety was paramount, and returned to his aircraft. Not one person had a bad word to say about him, or BA.If anything, as a result of his performance, BA’s stock actually soared. We understood that these things happen, it was just our bad luck the break occurred on our trip\u0026nbspbut, thank God\u0026nbspand thanks to BA’s\u0026nbspdiligence, it was spotted in time.Alas, the company’s standing was to sharply plummet. There was no one to guide us out of the airport, the hotel we were due to go to kept changing, there wasn’t a bus to take us there. We felt abandoned, at 5.30am at Dubai airport, a huge, sprawling place, buzzing with people even at that hour in the morning. After waiting forlornly for a coach, some of us took a cab and headed to one of the hotels that had been mentioned back in the lounge.When we got there, the hotel reception was unprepared for our arrival. Another wait ensued, while they tried to contact a local travel agent who was liaising with BA. Finally, at 7.30am, we went to our rooms.At night, we again went off to the airport. Again, there was no bus, no one co-ordinating our departure from the hotel, nobody taking care of us. Again, we had to jump into taxis.Once more at the airport, there now was pandemonium. We had to check in, at the same time as the passengers booked on that night’s BA106. Two sets of customers all trying to check-in simultaneously on flights bearing the same number. Eventually, after much shouting, those due to go as scheduled that evening were allowed to go first –\u0026nbspwe were informed our plane would be taking off an hour after theirs, at 3.30am.Forget the outrage about Dyson’s HQ move - we need to learn from itCheck-in staff were swamped, not least because many were also\u0026nbspchecking in for connecting flights at Heathrow. We reached the lounge, and waited,\u0026nbspand waited.We saw the other passengers leave for their flight which took off as planned. Ours, due to depart in an hour, was still not being shown as ready to board. A\u0026nbsptannoy\u0026nbspannouncement said it was being pushed back further. No reason was offered – that was it. Now there was anger, and mutterings of “next time I will fly Emirates”. Finally\u0026nbspwe left Dubai, 28 hours late.The contrast between the earlier delay and this one, between the captain and the ground staff, between the orderly manner in which he told us we would be staying in Dubai for 24 hours and the chaos subsequent to his news could not have been starker.Why? A captain feels responsible for his aircraft, its crew and passengers. Ours was driven by a sense of duty to see that we were okay, that we understood and appreciated the situation. The ground staff, and whoever was meant to take care of our well-being after we left his charge did not share his feeling of responsibility. They were local, they were dealing with numerous flights all day long, not just one that was late.The captain was driven by ownership they were not. The captain had been well-taught\u0026nbspbut he also came across entirely spontaneously. His colleagues had either missed the lesson or had not taken it in. Rather than behave naturally they stuck to an all-too familiar, inflexible, robotic style of delivery. No one was in command, nobody cared about the customers.Sadly, all the captain’s efforts were undone. BA must try harder: it’s no use one person stepping up, if the others around him fail to do so. It’s about everybody working together, and them all being joined up, not an inidual operating solo. He may have been brilliant, but the brand still emerged as the overall loser.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For good reason: the life of Elizabeth Morgan, née Caswell, is like a plotline on Call the Midwife. Morgan was born in Castleside, County Durham, as an unexpected twin to a family so poor\u0026nbspshe had to sleep in a drawer.Aged\u0026nbsp16\u0026nbspshe qualified as a nurse and worked in the Edinburgh slums. After responding to an advert from the Department for International\u0026nbspDevelopment in the 1970s, she was posted to Borneo\u0026nbspwhere she delivered babies in the rainforest and set up medical centres in remote tribal villages. By the time she came home, she had been involved in delivering the last ever smallpox vaccine.Michelle Obama’s memoir promotion will look like ‘a Madonna tour’This simple summerhouse near Berlin hides the most incredible storyPrince’s memoir will finally be released later this yearFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMorgan had been to classes to learn how to write a memoir. She tried to write down the things she had experienced, but they always looked like lists of dates. Then last year, when she learned she had an aggressive form of breast cancer, her daughter knew it was their last chance. Ms Stewart says: “We thought if we didn’t get it written down we never would.”In February, Ms Stewart and her mother received four bound copies of their mother’s hardback memoir: Elizabeth Caswell: Ai ya, Sister!\u0026nbspElizabeth appeared in a black and white portrait on the cover: a striking\u0026nbspdark-haired woman with clear eyes and a prim white nurses hat. The memoir is one of hundreds that have been produced by Story Terrace, a startup founded on the idea\u0026nbspthere should be a biographer for every person. Using ghostwriters, it plans to turn a million life stories into books within 10 years.\u0026nbsp“It’s like social media for writing books, you find the person who fits with you,” Ms Stewart says. \u0026nbspShe had looked at hiring a biographer before, but had always been put off by the cost, which ran into the thousands. On the Story Terrace website, she\u0026nbspwas able to browse writers, read sample chapters and select a package starting at £1,500 for four\u0026nbsphours of interviews and four copies of a 60-page colour hardback book.\u0026nbspRutger Bruining, who started Story Terrace in the Netherlands in 2014, got the idea for a bespoke writing service after he saw\u0026nbspAustralian company Freelancer,\u0026nbspa platform described as “the world’s largest marketplace for outsourcing” where people can compete for jobs,\u0026nbspgo public. In 2013\u0026nbspthe company was forced to close its initial public offering (IPO) early after demand overwhelmed supply of the 30 million shares offered.\u0026nbspThe IPO caught Bruining’s attention. He had been thinking about scalable ways to tell people’s stories. After a stint in management consultancy, he did an MBA at Columbia University in New York and then returned to Europe to work in private equity in London. He saw the Freelancer IPO and was struck by two things: the site hosted really good writers who were offering their services to anyone, and the founders were using software to manage freelancers all around the world.\u0026nbspThis technology opened up the possibilities for a memoir-writing agency. Rather than hire 20 staff writers to work with customers, Story Terrace works with 500 writers and matches them to clients based on their location, education and cost, among other factors. “We can do that anywhere in the world, and we can still make beautiful books for people,” Mr Bruining says. “Without tech that wouldn’t be possible.”Story Terrace recommended a writer called Judy Brown to tell Elizabeth Morgan’s story. The family were allocated several hours, but Ms Stewart says they spent a productive afternoon. Ms Brown came to see her mother despite a broken ankle and asked gentle questions that started to reveal a narrative. Ms Brown says that process of getting to know a client well enough to inhabit their voice “can take a few gos”, but describes the process as an honour. “It makes people feel like they have done something. Until you look back and you see the story as a whole it can be hard to see quite how much you’ve achieved.”Neither Mr Bruining nor Ms Brown reveal writers’\u0026nbsprates. The former\u0026nbspsays the writers, who get paid a set fee per job, are “by far the biggest cost” to the business. Ms Brown, who is retired and has worked on as many as 14 memoirs through Story Terrace, says\u0026nbspthe work provides useful extra income, but that it would be difficult to make a full-time living out of it.Story Terrace launched in the UK in 2016 and has now had 700 clients globally. The company raised £590,000 in a crowdfunding round with Seedrs in 2017, taking the total value raised to £1.5m. Mr Bruining says the money is going towards building a “bookmaker platform” that will automate the design processes so they no longer have to employ inhouse designers.The next task will be to scale. In January\u0026nbspthe company recruited Francois Coumau, a former eBay executive, to make new hires and smooth processes as the company grows. Angela Watts has joined after spending eight years at Spotify in the lead up to its IPO, to work on building awareness of the brand. Ms Watts says\u0026nbspshe was impressed by the early success of the service: “Story Terrace’s growth to date is admirable for a company creating a completely new product category – and they’ve only just scratched the surface.”\u0026nbspHalf the books commissioned on Story Terrace are gifts, often from relatives. Many have revealed extraordinary stories. A woman called Teresa Ibrahim has narrated her story growing up in poverty in rural Sudan, “in the fog of civil war”, to setting up charities for the education and empowerment of other displaced women. Another\u0026nbspexplores the journey of a Mongolian child to Britain in 1998 as one of the first generation of post-Soviet Mongolians allowed to leave the former communist regime. \u0026nbspFive real life stories that will change what you believe aboutAlison Stewart says her mother, now 80,\u0026nbspnever thought her story was that special. But the process of writing the book has brought back many memories, from the ambulance men who used to flirt with her at the Mayday Hospital in Croydon, to the sudden surfacing of a whole set of photos from her graduation as a nurse.Ms Stewart, who has a passion for working out her family history, imagines the book will sit alongside her other research: from the family tree, to the diary of her great great grandfather, who was born in 1801. “I’ll put them all together,” she says. “In 100 years, someone else will be able to find it.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He treated the passengers like human beings, like grown-ups, describing how the wing flap was not operating properly when they tested it, and on inspection, a tiny bracket was found to have snapped. BA didn’t have one, but he was optimistic that Emirates did. It could be fitted fairly quickly, and we would soon be able to fly to London safely.After an hour it emerged Emirates did not have the part, after all.\u0026nbspKLM might, we were told.

Nobody had any complaints. Thanks to the captain’s communication skills, the mood was one of good-humoured acceptance. He said he would see us the following evening, bade us farewell, apologised again, but stressed that our safety was paramount, and returned to his aircraft. Not one person had a bad word to say about him, or BA.If anything, as a result of his performance, BA’s stock actually soared.

There was no one to guide us out of the airport, the hotel we were due to go to kept changing, there wasn’t a bus to take us there. We felt abandoned, at 5.30am at Dubai airport, a huge, sprawling place, buzzing with people even at that hour in the morning. After waiting forlornly for a coach, some of us took a cab and headed to one of the hotels that had been mentioned back in the lounge.When we got there, the hotel reception was unprepared for our arrival. Another wait ensued, while they tried to contact a local travel agent who was liaising with BA. Finally, at 7.30am, we went to our rooms.At night, we again went off to the airport. Again, there was no bus, no one co-ordinating our departure from the hotel, nobody taking care of us. Again, we had to jump into taxis.Once more at the airport, there now was pandemonium. We had to check in, at the same time as the passengers booked on that night’s BA106. Two sets of customers all trying to check-in simultaneously on flights bearing the same number. Eventually, after much shouting, those due to go as scheduled that evening were allowed to go first –\u0026nbspwe were informed our plane would be taking off an hour after theirs, at 3.30am.Forget the outrage about Dyson’s HQ move - we need to learn from itCheck-in staff were swamped, not least because many were also\u0026nbspchecking in for connecting flights at Heathrow. We reached the lounge, and waited,\u0026nbspand waited.We saw the other passengers leave for their flight which took off as planned. Ours, due to depart in an hour, was still not being shown as ready to board. A\u0026nbsptannoy\u0026nbspannouncement said it was being pushed back further. No reason was offered – that was it. Now there was anger, and mutterings of “next time I will fly Emirates”. Finally\u0026nbspwe left Dubai, 28 hours late.The contrast between the earlier delay and this one, between the captain and the ground staff, between the orderly manner in which he told us we would be staying in Dubai for 24 hours and the chaos subsequent to his news could not have been starker.Why? A captain feels responsible for his aircraft, its crew and passengers. Ours was driven by a sense of duty to see that we were okay, that we understood and appreciated the situation. The ground staff, and whoever was meant to take care of our well-being after we left his charge did not share his feeling of responsibility. They were local, they were dealing with numerous flights all day long, not just one that was late.The captain was driven by ownership they were not. The captain had been well-taught\u0026nbspbut he also came across entirely spontaneously. His colleagues had either missed the lesson or had not taken it in. Rather than behave naturally they stuck to an all-too familiar, inflexible, robotic style of delivery. No one was in command, nobody cared about the customers.Sadly, all the captain’s efforts were undone. BA must try harder: it’s no use one person stepping up, if the others around him fail to do so. It’s about everybody working together, and them all being joined up, not an inidual operating solo. He may have been brilliant, but the brand still emerged as the overall loser.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Until the other day, I had no idea that a sausage even had any meaning (unless, that is, you happen to be ravenously hungry). Imagine the surprise, therefore, of the conservators in London who, back in 1983, were sprucing up a classic painting by the 17th-century Dutch master Jan Steen, when they discovered a lost sausage. Or rather not so much lost as “disappeared”.\u0026nbspYou can see that painting, Celebrating the Birth, in all its domestic glory, in the wonderful Wallace Collection in Manchester Square, just off Oxford Street. But prior to 1983 you would not have seen the sausage, or indeed the hand of the long-haired artist himself, about to go out of the door at the back of the kitchen, holding two fingers over the head of the babe. Painting “cleaners” (or conservators) are sometimes like detectives carefully inspecting the scene of a crime. In this case their research took them back to the Victorian period when the works of Shakespeare could be re-written for the purpose of making more of a happy ending – and when the statue of a naked David in the V\u0026ampA could have a fig-leaf applied to the relevant parts on the occasion of a visit from Queen Victoria.Probably sometime in the 1850s, a skilful painter had been employed to paint over (rather as you might use software today to remove undesirable elements from your favourite holiday snap) the offending sausage and the two-fingered salute – originally dating from 1664 (the year is\u0026nbspspelt out in the painting itself). But what was the big deal about the sausage anyway? How could hypersensitive Victorian morality be offended by the depiction thereof?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI had the advantage of being accompanied by the very knowledgeable Anne Fay, head of education at the Wallace Collection, but you can work it all out for yourself just by looking very intently at the restored painting, now hanging in East Gallery II. In Holland you can still talk about a “Jan Steen” household or room. But the phrase isn’t necessarily complimentary. It doesn’t mean “beautiful” or “artistic”, but rather “chaotic” or “messy”. “Celebrating the birth” depicts a busy, bustling kitchen scene or “lying-in room”.There are 16 people crowded into the room (counting the babe), with a lot of cooking going on around the fireplace. In the foreground, lying on the floor are several broken eggshells together with pots of what looks like maple syrup and a roll on a plate. A buxom cook is leaning over a cooking pot mixing some kind of brew with a ladle and holding out her other hand for payment.The sausage (or, technically, a string of sausages) is hanging down from above the fireplace, attached to the chimney. It is long and rather limp-looking and probably deserves the word, “dangling”. A maid is handling it, looking out of the picture directly towards the spectator, with an expression that might be roguish. But what does it mean and why would you want to paint it over? People ate sausages back then, didn’t they? Why would you not have one in a kitchen?The sausage, you will have guessed, is susceptible to a phallic reading. The prudish Victorians\u0026nbspthought so. It could be mistaken for the same sexual organ\u0026nbspthe David fig-leaf was designed to conceal. And a long but rather flaccid one at that. But, as Freud may have said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. And isn’t a sausage sometimes nothing more than a traditional form of fast food? But now combine the sausage with the image of the painter holding up two fingers over the head of the father figure.Is this an obscene gesture? Only in the sense that the two fingers are meant to represent horns and thus signify “cuckold”. The painter, in other words, is suggesting – every father’s nightmare – that the father is not in fact the father. His wife is cheating on him. So we look carefully at the nominal father, who is holding the child in one arm and reaching into his pouch with his other hand (probably to pay the midwife). He has a grey beard and an apron, and is no spring chicken. Combined with the limp sausage, the implication is that the ageing man could be impotent and incapable of fathering a child.Who then is the father? And we should remember that there is a pregnant woman in the kitchen, sitting comfortably on the left of the scene, sipping a drink, looking rather beatific (possibly sozzled too). The leading candidate for rogue inseminator is the painter himself. Rather like Alfred Hitchcock making a brief appearance in one of his own movies, Jan Steen would often paint himself into the picture. And if he is making a point here, it is less an assertion of his own sexual prowess than the subtle reminder that indeed he and no other has given birth to every single one of the figures depicted in the painting. The two fingers are like a Steen signature, saying: “I am the artist.”The Wallace Collection is one of the nation’s great treasures but modest in scope by comparison with some of our better-known museums. And it’s housed in a building, Hertford House, that doesn’t look much like a museum either. It was originally a hunting lodge when it was built in the 18th century, with a curving driveway in front. You might not even notice it, tucked away as it is behind Selfridge’s. But the whole collection is an exercise is being more alert and noticing stuff you might not otherwise notice or know about. For example, until I had a good look at a gorgeous ancien régime chest of drawers that once adorned Versailles, I had no idea that the chest of drawers (or “commode”) was an 18th-century invention. I have no idea where they used to put their socks and smalls before then.\u0026nbspMy guide Anne Fay helpfully explained that the word “Rococo” comes from the French rocaille, meaning rocky ground or rockery, and containing elaborate references to natural configurations such as shells and pebbles. But she also directed me towards a small but bewitching painting, The Swing\u0026nbspby the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard (dated 1767). The central figure in this work is a pure Disney princess at first glance. The girl on the swing – or let’s say, young woman, aged perhaps 18 at most – is radiant. She seems to generate light or, to turn it around, the spotlight is all on her. She looks ecstatic and her peachy, lacey, frilly dress similarly emanates a kind of joie de vivre. Even her bergère hat is jaunty.But again, if you look carefully, there are elements in this painting that Disney, while borrowing the wardrobe, would surely prohibit. One of the girl’s dainty shoes is flying up through the air. Lying on the ground, to the left of the painting, underneath the swing, is a young man, his hat in his hand, a flower in his buttonhole, his face illuminated by the light of the girl. He too looks delighted. His gaze is directed towards the girl. But if we follow his gaze carefully we can see that he is looking right up into her dress, which is billowing open as she kicks her legs. We see a flash of bare thigh, she may or may not be wearing any underwear, we do not know. But there is a liberated, playful quality to the girl that suggests possibly not. Without any actual cameras, the painting gives us a classic scene of upskirting. But, so far as we can judge, consensual. The girl and the young man may well be lovers.\u0026nbspBut as you might expect there is a love triangle here. Look to the right of the painting and you will see, almost hidden in the shadows, a much older man, who is pulling the ropes attached to the swing – perhaps trying to pull the girl back to him. Who is he? Probably the husband. Also, quite possibly – as in the Steen painting – cuckolded, displaced in the marital bed by the younger man (who is, after all, already lying down and is being given a privileged through-the-keyhole glimpse of what is typically concealed).The girl on the swing looks entirely carefree. She is having a great time. She may be making some mocking gesture to do with her husband. But there are subtle hints in the painting that not all is well. For one thing, if you look carefully, the ropes that suspend the swing from some kind of grotto appear to be fraying. The swing itself may be unsafe. There are storm clouds gathering. The cupid figures dotted around the canvas are looking nervous. And finally, a little white-haired dog that you might not even notice, down on the right-hand side, is watching and barking. As if everything is about to go wrong. The painting is only a still, a snapshot, but it contains narratives, with alternative endingsBut probably the single most famous painting in the whole of the collection is The Laughing Cavalier, by Franz Hals (1624). Of course the irony of this painting is that the subject is neither laughing nor is he a cavalier. But he does look almost absurdly pleased with himself. He is smiling broadly and even his bristling handlebar moustache is smiling. He has rosy cheeks, curly hair, bright eyes, and is in blooming health. There are unproven theories as to who he is or was precisely. But none of that really matters. The laughing cavalier is a hyper-realistic image of vivacity, brimming over with good will and pleasure and, perhaps, anticipation.Because, as in the Fragonard, there is a suggestion of a sexual encounter to come. Is he perhaps a bridegroom looking forward to his wedding night? Or is he on his way to meet his secret lover? His richly detailed garb implies as much. The embroidered sleeve of his silk tunic (with no less than nine buttons on the cuff) is decorated with any number of symbols suggestive of a carnal union: Cupid’s arrows and lovers’ knots. But we also have a flaming cornucopia and a bee – connoting honey and sweetness but also, potentially, a sting.So Hals is being rather poised and ambiguous here. The laughing cavalier is rather like the girl on the swing, on a high, but he could conceivably come down with a bump if he’s not careful. We don’t know, we only have the immortal moment of hope and expectation. Which cannot be extinguished. But could be understood as over-optimistic. And yes, the eyes really do follow you around the room.I live a 10-minute cycle ride away from the Wallace Collection. And yet I barely knew it was there until the other day. The Wallace Collection is due mainly to Sir Richard Wallace, who was probably the illegitimate son of the 4th Marquess of Hertford and is described in a new book by Suzanne Higgott as “the most fortunate man of his day”. His collection was bequeathed to the nation by his widow, Lady Wallace, in 1897. But she didn’t leave any endowment for the purposes of upkeep.The museum, which is free to enter, now makes its living partly on the basis of retail and renting out its space. You can have a wedding party, Jan Steen-style, in the Grand Gallery for a cool £20,000. Or stage your corporate event there, in one of the most elegant settings in the country. Or just come for lunch or dinner in the courtyard café.A museum devoted to dogs is opening in New YorkInside New York’s new spy museumSalvador Dali artwork damaged \u0027by visitors taking photos\u0027 in galleryBut the paintings and fine works that are exhibited there remind you of the importance of not just seeing but looking. As one of the parables (in Mark’s gospel) says, you can see and yet not perceive. One of the great lookers (in the sense of doing the looking rather than being looked at) was Henry Moore. An exhibition of his works is opening at the Wallace in March. Moore would sit here and get inspiration in the armoury. He could see helmets were not just function they were also form. The helmet morphs, in his hands, into a symbol of protection that embraces mother and child.\u0026nbspBut what is the point of art anyway? Is it to reveal, in a Freudian way, the hidden pathways of the unconscious? To boast of the artist’s libido? One plausible evolutionary theory about the function of art maintains that it came about as an accessory to courting. A way of wooing or seducing. Come up and see my cave paintings some time. So therefore it’s not surprising if love triangles and other erotic geometries also get into the picture. But it can’t just be that surely.\u0026nbspFor anyone brought up on Monet and Picasso, the Wallace Collection, with works that date largely from before the French Revolution, comes as a bit of a shock. The level of sheer realism, in some of those Dutch paintings, is dazzling. But there is a connection with modern painters even as abstract as, say, Mark Rothko (whose work is dramatised in the play Red). All those sustained blocks of colour, or Campbell’s soup cans (as painted by Warhol), are related to The Swing and The Laughing Cavalier by virtue of the infra-ordinary – all the stuff that we normally don’t notice. Works of art ask us to be more alert. To be better sensory beings. They are telling us to pay attention to the world. To take note of little things. Even if it’s only a sausage.Andy Martin is the author of Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.\u0026nbspThe exhibition, “Henry Moore: The Helmet Heads”, runs at the Wallace Collection 6 March to 23 June.

In the 1990s I sat in the stands when Tom Brady – whose New England Patriots just won their sixth Super Bowl – was not the Tom Brady we know today, but was second, even third-string, backing up other future NFL quarterbacks at Michigan.If Brits think their families’ and communities’ commitments to football clubs are more authentic than Americans’ because they go back further, they are looking to the wrong league and teams. Our connections and century-long traditions are not found in the NFL, but, rather, with our college football programs that – like your links to British football clubs – go back to the nineteenth century.Patrice Evra sparks backlash for ‘patronising’ applauding of Eni AlukoAnd our rivalries are just as fierce. Michigan’s rival of more than 100 years standing is The Ohio State University: my mother is a graduate and serious fan. She can tell you all the reasons why OSU traditions surpass the Wolverines’, and how Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is a beautiful 0-4 versus her Buckeyes. I learned from my mom that women are real, authentic fans too.Women play and follow football, many as seriously as men. But I experienced another first in Manchester. This was also my first experience in a traditionally male workplace that was still almost entirely, unapologetically, male. The only other women I saw in the press areas were serving food or working on the social media and communications teams for Man City and Arsenal. Pep Guardiola was so surprised to see a woman in the press room post-match that, when we made eye contact, his look of shock was priceless.I get it because I’m a historian. This is your “manly” sport. In the United States, our “manly” sports, historically, also happen to be our most insular and quintessentially American sports: baseball and American football. So while they may not translate neatly, I realise we have similar man-zone problems. In my lifetime, both our countries have worked to improve ersity and inclusion in sports participation and sports industries. We both have a long way to go.For all the claims of inclusivity and ersity that I saw in the national football museum on Saturday, I did not see it reflected in the match coverage on Sunday.Here’s the thing. I know there are hundreds, thousands of women in the UK who grew up playing football, cheering for local teams. They know the game as intimately as men do. They write well. They’re clever and funny and bring unique perspectives to their descriptions and analyses of the game. So why weren’t they in the media area on Sunday, and why was Pep so surprised to see me?Created with Sketch.Male cheerleaders make history at 2019 Super Bowl  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Inclusivity does not happen on its own. It requires ever-present work active, thoughtful decision-making by people in positions of leadership to commit to fundamental changes in their hiring practices, their mentoring cultures and professional growth opportunities, and their fostering of inclusive, healthy workplaces.\u0026nbspAfter all, the original construction of modern sport as a male domain was also man-made.\u0026nbsp(Ha.)I teach sports history at Arizona State University, and this semester I’m teaching a course on the history of baseball, or, rather, what baseball history tells us about American history.\u0026nbspHow multi-billion-dollar US college sports exploit their starsWe explore baseball’s critical role in both promoting and affirming an ideology of the supremacy of white men to hold positions of political, economic, and social authority, both within the United States and abroad.\u0026nbspThis was particularly so as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth when our country began to indulge its imperial ambitions beyond the North American continent. White men were fit to lead the world’s races, proving it through sporting prowess on the football gridiron and baseball diamond. This effort required pushing out people of African descent, and women, who had always been playing and loving baseball but now were forced to create their own separate – and often alternative or underground – teams and leagues to play in.When Jackie Robinson, who would have been 100 this year, desegregated Major League Baseball, joining the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he inspired future generations of young people to stake their rightful claim to sporting spaces despite being told their identities disqualified them.\u0026nbspIdeas about who belongs – and who does not – do not stay in the sport space they leach out and influence ideas about “natural” ability and interest in broader society.Here in England, for 50 years, from 1921 to 1971, the Football Association banned women from football pitches, declaring “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.” By no coincidence, this was at a time that women were gaining confidence both within and beyond sport, securing the right to the vote, enjoying public spaces, and demanding equal treatment in homes and workplaces.\u0026nbspWhat have I learned on my trip of firsts to the city of firsts? Sports hold incredible potential and power for social transformation. Sports are about people, and about bodies, and, most of all, they make us vulnerable. All of us. It’s in the space of vulnerability and strength and power and times of joy and times of pain that we hold the capacity and potential to see the humanity in each other.No matter the location on the planet, women athletes and sports professionals know that sports and politics have always mixed, because we’ve always had to fight so damn hard to play, to write about those who play, to coach and manage and take our seat in the boardroom. We won’t stop fighting to claim our right to play.

But the mission was retired in October, when its fuel finally run out and Nasa moved the telescope into a safe orbit and shut it down.The image – called last light, just as the first light was taken nearly ten years earlier – closes a mission that has discovered thousands of those distant worlds and brought hope that habitable planets deep in our galaxy could be waiting to be found.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince Kepler first opened its eye up to space and started looking for those stars, it found more than 2,600 worlds beyond our solar system – proving that planets are far more common than expected and that other places like our own Earth could be lurking out there.The image also shows some of the effect of those ten years. The blackened gaps at the middle and top of the image are where parts have failed in the camera, but Kepler was designed in a modular way that meant those problems did not affect the rest of the instrument.The final image came after Kepler\u0027s last observation campaign, for which it was pointed towards the constellation Aquarius.

That slight overlap means astronomers can compare data from the two spacecraft, helping calibrate and improve the data Nasa will go on to receive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel.

Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson.

Firstly, patronising language and awful single-shaming more redolent of early 2000s Bridget Jones, not a modern and empowered fintech brand,” Ms Bain tweeted.“Secondly, the way it pries into people’s private spending and exploits it so strangers can laugh at perfectly valid life choices that – we’re all expected to agree – are sad and pathetic.

She said:\u0026nbsp“This is not true... Not all of the food banks locally need referrals but if they do I can refer them. Please be assured that there are no changes to access.”But a caller to the centre requesting a referral\u0026nbspto food banks was advised to visit a Citizens’ Advice Bureau branch and told: “We’re no longer able to refer people to the food bank.”Ms Twitchen said she was concerned that\u0026nbsppeople wouldn’t\u0026nbspwant to put themselves in the “humiliating” situation of getting referred to a different agency.\u0026nbsp“I fear that people are going to be slipping through the net because of it,” she said.\u0026nbsp“I have people coming in in tears who are absolutely embarrassed and angry with themselves for the situation they are in – people are proud and they don’t want to admit they can’t cope. I’m really concerned that by taking away that easy option of going down to the jobcentre, people won’t come.”Helen Chiasson, coordinator of another food bank in Lewes called Fitzjohn’s, which serves between 35 and 40 households – or around 130 children and adults – said they hadn’t received any referrals from the jobcentre since the alleged changes were implemented.Universal credit claimants six times more likely to be in rent arrears“People are in a really bad state mentally but some of them are having to go to yet another place and explain their set of circumstances to another set of people. I’m worried that people will be put off using our service. The DWP have shown themselves to be a provider of a service that is inadequate.”A second leaked email from a food bank in Eastbourne, also in East Sussex, suggests that more than one jobcentre is following the no-referral advice, although it’s not clear how widespread the issue is.In one of the emails, the jobcentre worker wrote: “While we at Lewes Jobcentre have been adopting a locally agreed process, we have been advised that DWP policy does not permit Jobcentres to refer customers to foodbanks by issuing vouchers or referral forms.“We are allowed to verbally signpost them to your service and would be happy to do this, but unsure if this meets your needs.”A DWP spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbsptheir policy on food bank referrals had not changed. “Jobcentres will signpost people to food banks and other services according to their inidual circumstances, as part of their support to help people manage their finances and get into work,” the spokesperson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She is said to have told leaders behind closed doors that she accepts the backstop cannot be scrapped –\u0026nbspin a move likely to enrage her Eurosceptic Tory MPs.\u0026nbspEven if a Brexit deal is agreed, will we leave on 29 March?Rabid Brexiteers could learn a thing or two from TuskNearly £7,000 knocked off price of average UK home in Brexit slumpSpeaking after a meeting with the prime minister in Brussels, Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said “we welcome” the letter the Labour leader had sent to the prime minister\u0026nbsplaying out his party’s alternative proposals.“We have reiterated that we cannot have an agreement with uncertainty in the UK based on majorities of six, seven, eight, nine votes in the House of Commons,” Mr Verhofstadt said in a joint press conference with the parliament’s president Antonio Tajani.“That cross-party cooperation is the way forward and I think I can say that we welcome the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written to Mrs May to offer such a cross-party exit, I should say, to the Brexit.\u0026nbsp“It’s important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation.”He also confirmed that Ms May had in the meeting not sought to scrap the backstop and conceded it was necessary, adding: “Mrs May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop. What she said already in Belfast: there’s no question to remove the backstop, because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, internal market, and peace process.”The prime minister is understood to have received a similar message from Donald Tusk, the European Council president who represents the collective views of member states.Jeremy Corbyn writes to Theresa May outlining his five Brexit demands Sources with knowledge of the meeting between\u0026nbspMr Tusk and the prime minister said the president told Ms May that “the Corbyn plan could be a promising way out of the impasse”, according to\u0026nbspBuzzfeed News.EU officials who examined the Labour plan believe it to be broadly in line with EU negotiating guidelines, the website says.Labour last night called for a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union”, close alignment with the single market underpinned by “shared institutions”, protections on workers rights, and UK participation in some EU agencies. The policy moves the party closer to a so-called “Norway+” Brexit that would keep the UK in the bloc’s orbit, though technically outside.In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month.The two negotiating teams have been formally stood down since the withdrawal agreement was agreed between the two sides last year, with the EU saying it did not anticipate any further meetings. But with MPs in Westminster blocking the ratification of the agreement, officials will begin meeting again.The joint statement said the gathering was “held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU”.Theresa May is said to have explained the situation in Westminster to Mr Juncker and raised “various options for dealing with these concerns”.But Mr Juncker responded by underlining that the EU27 would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – describing it as ”a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal”.He however “expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK”, according to the read-out of the meeting.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentThe statement concluded: “The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.”Ms May’s meeting Mr Tusk comes a day after he caused a row by warning that there was a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without even a basic plan for how to actually enact it. Speaking after her meeting she said: “I’ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the UK.\u0026nbspThe point I made to him is that we should both be working to ensure we should deliver a close relationship between the UK and EU in the future and that’s what he should be focusing on.”Speaking on her way back to London, she added: “I’ve had a good series of meetings today. We’ve had robust discussions but they’ve been constructive.\u0026nbsp“What I’ve set out is our clear position: that we must secure legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to deal with the concerns that parliament has over the backstop.

But she was sent back empty-handed.\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0026nbspmet the heads of all the EU institutions and was told the same thing: we won’t renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHowever, they said they would be happy to change the political declaration for the future relationship.What’s the difference?The withdrawal agreement is a binding legal contract – it covers issues like what happens to EU citizens in the UK, the orce bill, and, most controversially, the Irish backstop policy.But there is another part of the agreement between the UK and EU. Its full name is “the political declaration on the future relationship”. It isn’t legally binding, but it spells out what sort of relationship the EU and the UK government intend to have after Brexit – whether or not the UK is in the single market, customs union, etc.What’s currently in the political declaration?In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handIt’s very vague. You may remember “Chequers” – that was Theresa May’s plan that she agreed with her cabinet, after negotiating with her own party. That’s not happening – the EU has rejected it.\u0026nbspThe declaration is currently more-or-less meaningless, spelling out both the EU and the UK’s red lines. It leaves actual decisions on the future relationship for the future. But unless the UK’s red lines shift, it essentially points to a hard Brexit – border checks on goods, no free movement, and the like.Why would the EU suggest changing the political declaration if the backstop is the problem, and it is in the withdrawal agreement?There are two reasons. The first is technical: the future relationship, as it currently stands, would not prevent a hard border in Ireland. The EU sees the backstop as an insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland – no matter what future relationship is negotiated, there won’t be one as long as the backstop can come in.But a more ambitious future relationship that kept the UK aligned with the single market and customs union would prevent a hard border by itself – and mean the backstop never needs to happen. In that way, it is related to the backstop.\u0026nbspThe second reason is political: changing the declaration is key for those who support a soft Brexit. Labour says it will support the deal in parliament if the future relationship is changed to include alignment with the single market and a customs union, as well as protections for workers’ rights.\u0026nbspSo why doesn’t Theresa May renegotiate the future relationship to pass the deal?Jacob Rees-Mogg invited to strip naked for Brexit debateJaguar owner posts thumping loss in another blow to UK car industry May facing resignations as Brussels sends her away empty-handedSoftening the Brexit laid out in the future relationship would have the opposite effect on the Tories as it would to Labour: most of Theresa May’s own MPs would become even more hostile to it, and her.She might be able to pass the Brexit deal with Labour support – if she made it that far. But her party would be in uproar. They don’t like the backstop – or even Chequers – because they see it as too similar to being in the EU. Labour’s plan for a permanent customs union and single market alignment would likely alienate even more, because it represents even closer alignment to Brussels.There are some Tory MPs who would welcome a softer Brexit, but they are thought to be in the minority.\u0026nbspSo would Theresa May be ousted if she backed Labour’s demands?It’s not easy\u0026nbspto predict what would happen. In one sense, she is safe: she cannot be formally ousted as leader of the Tory party for another 10 months. This is because under the party’s rules, a leader cannot be challenged for a year after they survive a first attempt at being toppled from within,\u0026nbspas she did late last year.However, she is not immune from the entirely separate parliamentary confidence votes that take place in the Commons. These are the standard votes of all MPs on whether they have confidence in the government. She would remain leader of the Conservative Party if she lost – but no longer be prime ministerCreated with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendWhether livid Tory MPs – or the DUP on whom she relies for support – will continue to support her in these votes is an open question. There is no limit to how many can be called or when.Alternatively, even if she cannot be formally ousted, the party might simply become ungovernable. May might struggle to fill her front benches and be in a state of open warfare with the rest of her party. That situation has effectively forced other party leaders to resign, even when they cannot be technically made to leave.Or it could all be fine. We can’t predict the future – but she certainly has good cause to be worried.People say the political declaration is not legally binding – is that true?Yes, it’s simply a statement of intent by the two parties. But political declarations are still important – you can’t be taken to court over them, but if the political pressure is still there to enforce them, they have an effect.\u0026nbspFor example, the part of the Good Friday Agreement that says there should be no hard border is a political declaration. The situation the UK is currently in shows that has real force – as long as there is political will to enforce it.It is likely that Labour would hold the government to its political declaration of the future relationship with the EU – if the declaration was discarded later, the government would have no majority for the Brexit it sought. \u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Countries are being asked to sign up blind,” said Liz May, the charity’s head of policy.Labour want new Brexit vote if May rejects our plan, McDonnell says“Without the full picture of how the EU and UK will trade in the future, it is impossible for countries to judge what these deals are really worth, how they will work in practice or even how some elements will be enforced.“Instead of acknowledging this difficulty, the government is relying on developing countries being compelled to sign up at the last minute, rather than risk high tariffs being slapped on their key exports.“This type of bad-faith negotiating – using implicit threats to get countries ‘over the line’ – is not a great way to start the UK’s independent trade policy.”No developing country has gone public with criticism of the UK’s approach, but some are believed to have objected privately and displayed their unhappiness by refusing to re-sign the deals so far.In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handMay facing resignations as Brussels sends her away empty-handedJacob Rees-Mogg invited to strip naked for Brexit debateNo-deal fears over medicine supplies spark rush for UK-supplied drugsCrucially, food products, particularly bananas, sugar and beef, have among the highest tariffs if a country must trade on WTO rules, without a preferential deal.Mr Fox himself acknowledged the risk to developing countries from Brexit after his own department floated a proposal to abolish all tariffs if the UK crashes out of the EU, to avoid soaring inflation.He told a committee of MPs it would “erode preferences for developing countries, because they would lose the ability to take the advantage that is conferred by lower tariffs”.The “threats” are the latest controversy to erupt over the failure to secure the deals – worth 12 per cent of the UK’s total trade – with the clock ticking down to Brexit day.The focus has been on the danger of higher prices for British shoppers, and job losses in this country, but Traidcraft said the implications were potentially more severe for developing nations with deals.Richer countries, including Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Japan and South Korea, have the power to withstand pressure – and even push for better terms than exist\u0026nbspwith the EU.But, says Traidcraft, the poorest countries are vulnerable to the “sign up or lose\u0026nbspit” approach from London.A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade, said: “We take seriously our commitment to reduce poverty through trade and our top priority is providing continuity for our existing trading arrangements as we leave the European Union. \u0026nbsp“All developing countries that have economic partnership agreements with the UK have said they want to maintain their existing arrangements after we leave the EU and we have already signed a continuity agreement with eastern and southern African countries. We also intend to introduce a trade preference scheme that will benefit around 70 developing countries.”Ms May called for the UK to remove the pressure by offering one-way full-market access\u0026nbspon a temporary basis\u0026nbspuntil deals to help development could be agreed “in an orderly manner”.The UK was also unable to say which organisations would regulate health and safety of products\u0026nbspand standards\u0026nbsp“because some of this thinking simply hasn’t been done yet”, she added.If the Commons eventually passes the Brexit deal, it includes a 21-month transition period during which existing terms would continue to apply – but a crash-out would tear up the deals on 29 March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereDepartment for International TradeOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just eight years after ousting Mr Thaksin, the military stepped in again to remove his sister’s government in 2014.Mr Thaksin remains hugely popular with the country’s rural majority, who were drawn to his populist policies such as universal health care and rice subsidies. His backers were willing to overlook accusations that he was enriching himself while in office.Thailand set to hold first general election since 2014 military coup But Mr Thaksin’s popularity made the Bangkok-based establishment uneasy and some saw his popularity as a threat to the monarchy itself.Going into exile in 2008 to avoid serving prison time on a conflict of interest conviction, he is generally believed to have been involved in setting up Ms Ubolratana’s candidacy.It shook the country’s royalists, who have long seen their campaign against Mr Thaksin as a way to protect the monarchy.It was assumed that Ms Ubolratana, thought to be close to her brother, had at least received his approval for her action, but the royal family’s private affairs are almost never leaked.King Vajiralongkorn’s order stressed that the monarch and those around him stay above politics.It also directly addressed the point that his sister was a member of the royal family even though her formal royal titles had been lifted decades ago when she married a US citizen.Additional reporting by Associated PressOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Quick, the ambassador has had a seizure!Had Herr President Tusk, at this most delicate of moments, really told the likes of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to go to hell  Yes, pretty much.I know we are supposed to take ­mortal offence. I know we are meant to fan our faces and ask Nurse to bring us something to soothe our nerves after that nasty man uttered such a frightful insult.But I couldn’t help laughing at toothless Tusk’s tirade.At last, a European Union bigshot has blurted out his contempt for British voters.That’s surely preferable to all those smarmy smiles and fake phrases about “respect for each other’s values” and how we hope to work with “our European friends and partners”. Real friends don’t nick £billion off you.There are two things worth knowing about Donald Tusk. The first is that in his youth he was a bit of a brawler.The ­second is that five years ago he resigned as Polish prime minister to take up his current cushy number in ­Brussels.Born in , Tusk grew up in the city of Gdansk, when Poland was a grimy ­colony of the USSR. His family had ­German roots and his dad, a carpenter, died when Donald was . It can’t have made for an easy youth.Gdansk gave rise to the Solidarity trade union ­movement which protested against Iron Curtain suppression.Tusk has recalled that in his youth he was “a typical hooligan” who would ­saunter along the streets in a gang, ­“cruising for a bruising”.In some ways, who can blame him  They were edgy days and young men will do what young men have done since time immemorial: Defend themselvesunder attack. Communism wasa ­stinking and ruinous creed.Decent Poles bravely reasserted their national sovereignty after too many decades of being governed by ideological bureaucrats who couldn’t give a fig about the electorate.Er, remind you of anything, Mister ­Eurocrat That colourful background in the Gdansk of the s and s made it all the odder when, in , Tusk quit the premiership of his country to become an EU grand fromage.He had been Poland’s PM for seven years and the country had done well.Yet he chucked that in so that he could succeed shrivelling nonentity ­Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council.The job is less important than it sounds. Its occupant basically acts as a collector of opinions from EU heads of government and acts as their representative at ­international shindigs.That it was held by such a blinky-eyed vole as Van Rompuy was a measure of its signicance. Yet Tusk chucked in the prime ministership of his country for it!Brussels may offer wonderful pensions, top-trough brasseries and as many rides in the back of a BMW  Series as you could wish, but had Tusk gone mad The answer to that question is “not ­necessarily”. He saw that under EU rules, national governments are now increasingly junior to the federal superpower.The real power in Brussels lies not with Tusk, nor even with boozy European ­Commission president Jean-Claude ­Juncker, but with the backroom officials such as Martin Selmayr and Sabine ­Weyand. Both of them, you may notice, are ­German. This sht in powers has ­happened slowly over decades and ­electorates have taken a while to notice.But now the voters are copping on and are at last making their ­displeasure plain.The British Leave vote was the firstgreat expression of that anger.All of which helps to explain why ­unelected EU officials have been so ­spittingly angry with the British public for voting Leave. We have busted the dam.That is why Tusk snarled at us on Wednesday. He and his sort feel badly threatened by Brexit.They feel understandably insecure about the future of the federal EU project.The Tusks of this world regard the ­peoples of Europe as an inconvenience.They were appalled with David Cameron for letting the referendum happen and they are now appalled with our MPs for not stopping Brexit.Shortly before his “hell” remark on Wednesday, Tusk expressed his disbelief that Theresa May was insisting on ­pressing ahead with Brexit, and his ­disappointment that Remainers at ­Westminster had not succeeded in blocking our departure from the EU.At that point I must confess I shouted something rude at the television in my office. “It’s because we had a f***ing ­referendum and we voted to leave!” I cried.Shouting at a TV set: Uh-oh, I may have been driven as mad by Brexit as dotty Tory Europhile Anna Soubry. Tusk’s ­outburst was similar. Everyone’s losing it!The teenage Donald Tusk — the one who used to tour the streets of Gdansk with his gang — would, I think, have ­understood. I am not recommending ­violence but politically this is certainly a time we could all do with clenching our knuckles and looking out for our interests.Cruising for a bruising, a young lad in Gdansk might once have said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was the time Mallory ly bragged about spotting ­potential in crime novel The Cuckoo’s Calling by Robert ­Galbraith while working for ­publisher Little, Brown and Co in London, before it was known to be a pseudonym for Harry Potter author JK Rowling.Then there was a fabrication about working with US comedy actress Tina Fey, and “sexing up” the script for horror film Final Destination while working as an intern, neither of which are true, say the people involved.Poet Craig Raine, who taught English at Oxford, said Mallory’s application to do a PhD there included a moving story about ­caring for his brother Jake, who had cystic fibrosis, and his mother Pamela, who had breast cancer.He said: “At some point, when Dan was nursing her, he got a brain tumour, which he didn’t tell her about, because he thought it would be upsetting to her.“And evidently, that sort of cleared up. And then she died. The brother had already died.”Raine also believed Mallory had written that his dad John had also died. In fact, all three are alive.Pamela was treated for breast ­cancer when Mallory was a teenager.Her husband John, a former Wall Street banker, confirmed she had been “next to death”. However last year she joined Mallory on a book-promoting tour of New Zealand.Mallory does have a Masters degree from Oxford but he never completed his doctorate, even though he had signed emails from “Dr Mallory” in his second year. The story about the brain tumour came up again in , while working at Little, Brown.He wore a baseball cap, which many assumed was to cover hair loss from chemotherapy, and said he had less than a decade to live.Not long afterwards, he left Little, Brown. The New Yorker claimed Mallory’s boss discovered he had lied about a job offer at a rival company, which resulted in a promotion and pay rise to keep him at Little, Brown.“Once that fell away, then you think, ‘Is he really ill ’”, said one ­suspicious colleague.Two years later, in February , work friends in the UK received an email written by Dan’s brother, Jake, saying Mallory was due to have ­surgery to remove a tumour.US colleagues received a similar email, about the removal of a tumour from his spine, the following day. But some recipients had suspicions about the writing style and concluded they may have come from Mallory himself.Mallory has admitted that he lied about having cancer, saying it was easier than talking about his mental health.He said: “It is the case that on numerous occasions in the past, I have stated, implied or allowed others to believe that I was afflicted with a physical malady instead of a psychological one: Cancer, specically.”Apologising for his actions, he wrote: “I was utterly terried of what people would think of methey knew — that they’d conclude I was defective in a way that I should be able to correct, or worse still, that they wouldn’t believe me. Dissembling seemed the easiest path.”He has since spoken openly about his problems, including bipolar ­disorder, and said he chose to use a pen name because he did not want his publishing experience to affect his chance of getting a deal.He added: “I am not especially interested in author’s bios. I am ­buying their novel, not their memoir.I view it as a sign of respect to not want to know too much.”As his own stories unravel, Mallory will surely be hoping his readers think the same.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Im so sick of this.Technology tutor Teti has been charged with “being an authority figure soliciting or engaging in a romantic relationship.”He was said to have been reprimanded last October over contacting pupils via education app Remind Me.This written counselling by the schools administration was in regards to maintaining a professional and ethical distance with his students,” Broward Sherf’s deputy Timothy Metz wrote in the affidavit.But Teti circumvented administrative monitoring and suspicion by swapping mobile phone numbers with several of his students and communicating with them for the rest of term.Teti appeared to be grooming the girl, building her trust by, among other allegations,” the document says.He is said to have told the teen over the phone that he was worried about statutory rape charges and that it was legal in France to marry at the age of .“Shedoesn’t have to know, we can fly to France,” he allegedly said.Teti intensied his pursuit and would routinely send her sexually charged text messages, often late at night.In one text he drew a heart with her name in it, the affidavit said.He was also said to have messaged the girl the next day saying he tried to stalk her coming out of class, but could not find her.I think youre just avoiding me because youre afraid thatyoure near me for too long, you wont be able to control yourself and just going to attempt to start making out with me, Teti allegedly wrote.He also said she was in love with him, but you just dont want to admit it.”In another text - after the girl told Teti she was sexually deprived” - he suggested she use alternatives, the court document says.He also reportedly confessed his love for her and extended his arms to hug her in front of her pal in school.And she was “overwhelmed” when he found her address and sent her a package of snacks and notes.Teti was arrested after the girl’s dad accused him of being a paedophile when his other kids tipped him off abut the teacher’s texts.The teacher was said to have dismissed the accusation by claiming the messages were “a joke.”And in a call recorded by her father he “discussed the size of his penis and lack of stamina during sex,” reports Local  News.An education spokeswoman said Teti was sacked and escorted from school by police."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000467245052.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit tories new policies","story":"Where are the radical plans to sort the housing crisis, or soaring crime  Or to lower taxes, as Tories always should New NHS cash aside, what can Theresa May’s Government boast about after nearly three years of Brexit paralysis Its unhinged war on our sugar intake Its scandalous suffocation at birth of the fracking industry Sneaking through new taxes on the dead The Tories need a brand new offer to voters, and fast.BecauseBrexit is ever sorted, they will suddenly require answers to Corbyn’s armoury of policies.Most of those are ruinous throwbacks to the s.

And days ago conducted live fire drills for the first time - in temperatures plunging to - degrees.Brigadier Mike Keating, operations officer for Joint Helicopter Command, hailed the “extraordinary” chopper, saying: “We’ve got a world-class capability in the hands of the British Army.“That’s exactly why we brought it here, to learn those lessons and prove to ourselves and any adversaries out there that no matter where trouble might face us, we are prepared to go and face it.“Whether it’s in the deserts of Afghanistan or in the freezer of the Arctic Circle.The Apache Helicopter sends a psychological message to any potential enemy, to any foe that’s out there – just look at it – it bristles with weapon systems that are in many ways unique.”Last week The Sun travelled to Bardufoss, , miles from the UK and  miles inside the Arctic Circle, to witness Apaches from  Sqn, Army Air Corps, in action.British troops have been coming here for cold weather warfare training for  years, but now Top Brass have sent Apaches to the region in a bid to bolster NATOs Northern flank amid Russian aggression.The move comes as the Arctic is set to become a key new battleground as global warming opens new shipping routes and access to oil reserves beneath the ice.As a result both NATO allies and Russia have ramped up training and bought extra kit for the expected fight for control of the region.Now Britain has added Apache into the mix, armed with its mm canon, Hellfire missiles and rockets. They built up a ferocious reputation in the furnace of Helmand and Top Brass confirmed they are proving equally devastating in the Earth’s freezer.Next week Prince Harry – a former Apache pilot and current Captain General of the Royal Marines –will visit the region to witness the training, code named Exercise Clockwork.Brig Keating, called the addition of Apaches a “step change” adding: “Whether you are Royal Marine, a parachute Regiment soldier, whether you are an infantry soldier in the British Army, it is a game changer.“It brings a huge amount of firepower and it emboldens our ground forces as well. Andthat is sending a message to a whole range of adversaries, then that is the right thing to be doing.”Army Air Corps pilot Captain Ash – whose identity we are not printing for security reasons – said: “It was battle wining in Afghanistan, and we’ve come out to Norway and it is performing better than expected, so I fully expect to be a battle-winning aircraft in this environment as well.“The weather changes very quickly here, we have to be prepared to survive in the environment as wellwe have to go down on the ground.“I think it’s been a huge learning curve for everyone. It’s been amazing, it’s been great fun, we’re inside the Arctic Circle, flying the world’s best attack helicopter, what more could you want.”Operating in these harsh conditions is an almost impossible challenge. Troops must be forward based to remote locations ready to rearm and refuel the Apaches, living in tents buried in snow in the freezing conditions.The temperature beneath the rotor “disc” downwash is even colder but soldiers cannot wear their heavy mittens as they need to use their finders to load rounds and operate complex machinery. It means working time is massively reduced.Meanwhile the pilots have to contend with turbulence rushing up and down the mountains, freak snow storms, and terrain blanketed in white making it tough to see changes on the ground.They have all been trained in survival methodsthey have to go down in the snow miles from rescue.Brig Keating, said: “We can’t fly anywhere in the world without our boys and girls on the ground helping us. They are as crucial a part of this endeavour as the pilots who sit in the front of this aircraft.“And I take my hats off to them, what we are asking them to do, the conditions we are asking them to operate under, are quite incredible. To a person, they are brilliant people, they are thriving out here, they love the challenge, this is really hard soldiering out here.“If you can soldier here, you can soldier anywhere. We need to master this environment, and we know thatthe requirement to come fight here ever comes up we can do it.“To get that aircraft lting off, bristling with weaponry to go and do what it needs to do at the far end in an amazing achievement. It’s the boys and girls who pull it together and are prepared to face those conditions out there and deliver.”Top Brass said this training will be repeated over the coming months and years so troops on the ground can rely on attack choppers in any potential future war in the snow.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their job was to dig graves and operate the crematorium for the people of Liverpool. But for  anxious days, they were on strike in the Winter of Discontent that paralysed the nation and cost Labour political power in . The gravediggers’ walkout was demonised in headlines like “Now They Won’t Let Us Bury Our Dead!”. Families were split and violence flared on Merseyside in the dispute – merely a microcosm of a national confrontation between Labour premier “Sunny Jim” Callaghan and the labour movement. Such was the furore that  years later, survivors of the industrial action cannot bring themselves to talk about it openly.   One man who can is Ian Lowes, , the gravediggers’ GMB convenor at the time and still a union activist. He defends the strike. “It was ‘enough is enough’ by low-paid workers who were treated like dogs.” But he promises: “Never again.” The diggers’ down-shovels was a long time coming. Denis Healey, Labour’s Iron Chancellor, decreed a % pay rise limit for all workers in summer . At a secret meeting that autumn in his Sussex farmhouse, TUC leaders – among them David Basnett, leader of the cemetery workers’ union – warned him that, after years of wage restraint, they could not hold their members back.   Pay curbs were rejected at Labour’s annual conference, and the floodgates opened when striking Ford workers won a % pay rise. A tanker drivers’ walkout triggered a national fuel emergency before % increases were conceded. Public service unions swtly took up the cudgels and, on January , , staged a National Day of Action in support of a pound-a-week minimum wage, practically double the gravediggers’ money. In numbers, this was the biggest stoppage since the General Strike of . Eventually, the year lost ,, working days to stoppages. Stre came to Merseyside when GMB shop stewards representing , workers employed by Liverpool City Council met to plan a follow-up. “The national leaders had lost control,” says Ian. “So we decided to go for selective action, bringing out key workers and putting a financial levy on everybody . Binmen carried on working but we closed tips, so the rubbish piled up.”   In the Parks and Gardens department, eight crematorium workers and about  gravediggers were called out on a show of hands. This was the s, before Tory labour laws demanded pre-strike secret ballots. The walkout was solid. Pickets weren’t needed at the city’s big sites like Allerton Cemetery – where we’re speaking today – and the adjoining Springwood Crematorium. The levy meant the strikers enjoyed virtual take-home pay. It could have gone on indefinitely, like some of the walkouts by council workers that left London’s Leicester Square a mountain of uncollected refuse, and half the country’s hospitals on emergency admissions only as NHS manual workers joined the dispute.   Leaders of the Liberal-run city council begged the men to go back, the chief executive anticipating media malice with a plea, “Even in war they stop to bury the dead”. An irate GMB official came to Liverpool and ordered the men resume work, prompting a predictable Scouse raspberry. Hostility went off the Richter scale. Inevitably, Tory leader Margaret Thatcher condemned the walkout, sensing electoral opportunity. In the Commons, Anthony Steen, Tory MP for Liverpool Wavertree, called it “repugnant, an outrage to human decency” causing great personal distress to the bereaved. Some  bodies were awaiting burial or cremation, embalmed and stored in a disused factory in Speke, he told MPs. “This strike offends against the dignity of man, and is a horrying example of man’s indference and inhumanity to the dead,” he declared.  This was the MP later to find fame for claiming pound, expenses for his country home in Devon, where he moved after losing his Scouse seat. And a vicar shared this apocalyptic vision: “When gravediggers will allow corpses to mount up rather than carry out their duty, I detect the undermshyining of the whole structure of society.” Duty  For the men it was a job of work, carried out for -odd quid a week in all weathers, without protective clothing. They were not even allowed into the canteen for their break. A dumper truck came round with the tea and they ate their snap round an open hole. Ian insists: “This was all about a group of low-paid people fighting to try to get a better deal. They had a right to withdraw their labour but, when they did, the consequences were terrible.” As working-class men in communities, it was obvious strikers’ identities would be known. One was attacked in a pub and taken to AE, where it is said he was left for hours by NHS staff, even though they were in dispute, too. One whose mother died is still not speaking to the family. There were threatening letters and verbal abuse. In fact, I understand some cremations were secretly taking place at Springwood of bodies that could not be embalmed. They were held in the evening, by unpaid volunteers. In the second week of the walkout, they gathered to take stock. Enough really was enough – of the strike. The action was hurting ordinary people, not the government. They voted to go back after  tumultuous days in the eye of a media storm. Propaganda damage had done its worst in this corner of militancy, but the wider dispute did not end. Council workers struck, and unofficial strikes by ambulance staff and other public service workers continued until late February, when % pay rises were granted and Healey signed a peace treaty with the TUC. As a show of political unity, it was too little, too late. Jim Callaghan had ducked a general election in September . Labour was then five points in the lead in opinion polls, but by the end of the Winter of Discontent the Tories were  ahead. They were helped by complacent Callaghan, who ed from a conference in the sunny Caribbean and didn’t quite say to reporters at Heathrow, “Crisis, what crisis ” But the headlines did, and that’s what mattered in a nation on the cusp of radical political change. “Britain Isn’t Working” ads and TV broadcasts for the May election showed footage of rubbish piled in the streets, picketed hospitals and locked cemeteries. Swept into power on an anti-union ticket, Thatcher enacted laws that would have made the gravediggers’ dispute unlawful. Some say the unions dug their own grave. Does Ian, a one-time member of the hard-left Militant Tendency, think it could happen again  “In the last  years, this is the only time there has been a dispute in the cemeteries of Liverpool. There have been issues, but they have been resolved without strike action. My answer is no.” That might come as a relief to the  workers who still tend the city’s six cemeteries. And at least they can now sup tea in the canteen. One of the Class of  declined to talk to the Mirror, so these words may have to be the epitaph for the revolt of the Liverpool gravediggers.

Hundreds of thousands of people could lose the bus services they rely on as cash-strapped councils continue to be squeezed.

Jack Cremin, from Birmingham, quit his job in recruitment and booked a one-way flight to the Balearic Islands - and spent months enjoying boat parties, beers and scenes of pure barminess. He had always wanted to work at Europes party capital.Jack, , told Birmingham Live : I’d always wanted to do a season somewhere and, the previous year, I’d been to Ibiza three times.I love the place so, when I got a bit sick of recruitment and I was looking where, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to go and do it. Jack, then , went about working a five-month season from early June to October. But it didnt start the way he had hoped.   The season usually starts out there in May, he explained, but me and my friend chose to go over a bit later and so we struggled with accommodation. We managed to find a really cheap hostel at the top of the strip for the first three weeks and decided we would go from there. The hostel was awful. There were no windows in most of the rooms, you could hear everything from the strip all night long and there was barely enough room for one person, let alone two. The hell hole was literally something mad like pound for  nights. Jack, though, blew an eye-watering pound, in the first four weeks of being in Ibiza after deciding against getting a job.   But splashing the cash caught up with him and he soon found himself hopping from bed to bed to get some sleep. I decided before I went that I would most likely go for a club rep job, he said. But, with the first couple of weeks being so wild, I didn’t think about looking for work at all. I was too busy enjoying myself. And when it came to the girls, lets say it wasnt hard to find someone to take back. The real problem came when our three-week hostel stay was coming to an end and, with everywhere booked out, we were soon bed hopping or sofa surfing! Jack and his pal stayed on someones sofa for three nights in exchange for paying for a food shop before finally landing a job. And, after going from blowing almost two grand, he was soon noshing on Super Noodles sandwiches and downing cocktails.  We ended up selling boat party tickets, explained Jack, who now works for a fruit and veg company. This was a commission-based role where you would earn ten euro for every ticket sold or  euro for a package deal, which was a boat party and entry to Ocean Beach. This seemed like a good idea at the time but the thought of meeting at am on the promenade every day to debrief and then to walk around in the blistering heat all day soon wore off. Most of our days were spent waking up around  or pm, finding a nice posh hotel swimming pool to relax in pretending we were guests and then either going to an apartment party or trying to swindle together a few euros to go out on the strip. If you were low on money your best bet was to get a ‘Sketamine’ from Ground Zero, which would be five euro for five shots of vodka mixed with lemonade and grenadine to take away the kick, two of these would do the job. After eating like kings for the first six weeks or so, we soon found ourselves living off a diet of tuna and pasta, Super Noodles sandwiches or a ‘workers meal’ from Burger King which would consist of a small burger, fries and a drink for €..  Jack also admitted frequently downing cheap wine before sneaking into the swanky Ocean Beach Club, which is popular among celebrities, music stars and footballers. Its my favourite place in Ibiza but, as many people know, unless you pre-book a bed or are on holiday with plenty of spare cash, there isn’t much point in going, explained Jack. Luckily I found a way around this because one of the girls I know kept getting us in on the guest list. We would usually end up pre-drinking cheap wine to ensure we didn’t have to pay for many drinks when we got in there! Jack drank in well-known bars The Highlander and Soul City and, despite some low points during his time working abroad, he made friends for le and would do it all over again - only to plan it better for next time!  I’d do it againI was out of work, he said, but I’d definitely plan it a lot better. All in all, doing a season was a brilliant experience and I think it taught me a lot. One thing I would say is to make sure you have your accommodation sorted before you get over there!This can usually be done by joining one of the ‘workers groups’ on Facebook .Another little tip is to use these pages to book what are known as ‘workers taxis’ - these will often cost you around half the price of a normal taxi. And, although I would probably say I am maybe a bit too old to do another season, I would highly recommend it for any youngster looking to have a good time. I am also going back in June as I have planned my best friends stag do there!

Driver Haider Mirza, , caused le-threatening injuries to victim Ahmed Yousef, who suffered a fractured skull and now has one leg permanently shorter than the other. Shocked witnesses are seen rushing to help Mr Yousef following the crash in Normanton, Derby, in November .The victim was crossing the road when the Audi A with Mirza at the wheel ploughed into him, Derbyshire Live reports.Despite a public appeal, Mirza did not come forward, and evaded police for  months.  Judge Philip Wassall, who presided over the case, handed Mirza a custodial sentence of  months and banned him from driving. He also commended Derbyshire Live and the police for sharing the CCTV footage, as he stated this helped in Mirzas capture. Jailing Mirza, Judge Wassall said: This was appalling. You were in no doubt as to what you had done and you left the scene at an unabated pace. You would have known that the person you hit would be really seriously injured. Looking at the CCTV it is only through luck that Mr Yousef wasnt killed.  You have shown remorse, but I feel that stems from the position you are now in, rather than being genuine. You evaded officers for eleven months while they investigated the incident. The car has never been found and even when you were sent the link to the Derbyshire Live story of the police appeal, you still did not hand yourself in. You have got a bad motoring record, not just before this, but since. You are  years of age and you pleaded guilty in magistrates court. That is the first sign of something positive. You have had some heartfelt references from your family members, but I have to put these into context with what you have done. Mirza was at the wheel when his car hit Mr Yousef at .pm on November .  Derbyshire Live published CCTV footage of the incident and appealed for witnesses to come forward. Laura Pitman, prosecuting, stated that police scanned hours of CCTV footage to find the driver. A witness told police they partially spotted the numberplate of the car during the collision and officers were able to trace it to Mirza. He was arrested in January  and his phone was seized. During an -month investigation, officers found a number of messages sent to his partner which showed he was responsible for the hit-and-run incident. In the messages he had also stated the car had gone.  Mirza was arrested again in December . He appeared before magistrates the same month and pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving without a licence, failing to stop after a collision and using a vehicle with no insurance. Ms Pitman stated that Mr Yousef had been living in the UK since , was working and sending money back to Sudan to care for his mother. She said: Mr Ahmed was in work and was earning money and was sending a portion of it back to his mother in Sudan. At the time, she was very unwell and needed medical treatment. He has lost his home, is on benefits and is practically homeless. A friend of his is letting him stay at his place. He still has regular medical appointments at two hospitals and is still having physiotherapy. He still gets pain in his shoulder and right leg. One of his legs is now shorter than the other.  This accident has had an enormous impact on this gentleman who was simply out to buy credit for his mobile phone so he could call his family. Mr Yousef was in court to see the sentencing and spoke to Derbyshire Live following the case. He said: My le has been ruined, before the accident I had a very nice le and a le to look forward to. I was working, I was happy and content, but now I stopped working because of the accident and now my le is not that good. I am very happy that he got a just sentence. I am still going to hospital and I still have future appointments, this has changed my le. I dont have a say in the future, it is not in my hands or in my control, but I am waiting from the assessments and while I wait for them, I feel my le is not normal. I hope in the future everything will be OK. Detective Sergeant Darren Muggleton, of the serious collision investigation unit, said: We are pleased today after all this time that Mirza has been brought to justice. It has taken a long time to get here because he didnt admit to being the driver until the evidence reached court. We are pleased with the comments the judge made to the seriousness to this offence and the sentence given was appropriate. We released CCTV footage and it is horrendous. Mirza didnt slow down or stop and Mr Yousef was projected into the air. The whole team couldnt believe he survived, he was thrown into the air like a ragdoll. Mr Mirza must have known what had happened and it took months and months of a detailed investigation to establish the suspect. We would like to thank the public who gave us the leads that we needed to track down Mirza. Judge Wassall said: I would like to commend Derbyshire Live for their story which undoubtedly helped witnesses come forward who helped catch the defendant. The court also heard how Mirza had several relevant previous convicitons. In March , he failed to give his name and address after an accident and was handed a -month community order and  hours unpaid work. In August , he was disqualied from driving for  months. In October , he was disqualied from driving for  months for driving without due care and attention, driving without a licence and driving without insurance during for an incident that took place the previous July. Stephen Cobley, mitigating, said: The footage is absolutely shocking. His antecedence doesnt help him at all and there are aggravated feaures. It passes the custody threshld. He has been remorseful and realises what he has done. His family have written several heartfelt character references which show a dferent side to Mirza.

The Duchess of Sussex, seven months pregnant, feels she is being taken advantage of, a close friend is reported to have said. Samantha initially said the book - expected to hit shelves this year - would be called, The Diary of Princess Pushys Sister. The -year-old recently announced she would be writing a second book which will be called, In the Shadows of the Duchess. The first book is slated for publication in April - roughly when Meghan is expected to give birth.Samantha said in a recent interview with the Daily Star the book would cover everything from behind the scenes that the world does not know about.According to the Daily Mail , Meghan has told friends that she stopped reading interviews with members of her family after finding out about the first book two years ago and tries not to look at gossip about herself.The friend is quoted as saying: She cried when she found out about it. Out of everything thats been said, the one thing that really upset her was that [the book]. She and Samantha never had a very good relationship and she feels her sister is using her position for profit.  Samantha has been vicious towards her half-sister ever since their mutual father Thomas Markle Sr was diagnosed with heart issues a week before Meghans marriage to Prince Harry .He was unable to attend the Windsor wedding and Meghan is not thought to have seen him since, though he has given several interviews about their relationship begging her to get in touch. But this week friends of Meghan contradicted his version of events in an interview with People magazine, insisting the Duchess had tried to get in touch with her father and had been rebuffed.  The story also claimed he had responded to a heartfelt letter begging him to stop attacking her in the media with a note requesting a joint photoshoot.Sister Samantha has already responded to the new claims, taking to Twitter on Wednesday to dub the People story bulls***.She added: There are plenty of text messages and receipts to prove otherwise. Stop the PR crap #FakeNews.   Meghan has been out repeatedly in the past week: beginning with a visit to the National Theater in London on January  followed by a trip to City University the next day to attend a meeting of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. Last Friday, she joined husband Prince Harry, , for a visit to Bristol, which took in the Old Vic theater and the One charity kitchen where Meghan wrote empowering messages on bananas due to be delivered to sex workers.

Prince Harry has already said that the child can be anything they want to be. And sources have previously revealed they want the little boy or girl to lead a relatively normal le - much like the way Kate and William are bringing up George, Charlotte and Louis. So with a move away from the Palace to Frogmore Cottage on the cards, what kind of parenting style can we anticipate from the Sussex family   Expert, Danielle Stacey, Yahoos royal correspondent said: I think well see them take a more modern, hands-on approach to parenting and share parental leave. I think well see Meghan back to public engagements sooner than any other royal, possibly because of her American roots. Mothers in the US take much less maternity leave than we do here in the UK and that will also allow Harry to have some bonding time with the baby. Theres been much speculation about whether Meghan and Harry will employ a nanny to help with childcare as William and Kate have.  Other royal experts have previously suggested that Meghan and Harrys child will have less expectation than the Cambridge kids because of their place in line of succession  As seventh in line to the throne their baby wont have the level of expectation and responsibility that Prince George or the other Cambridge children have, OK! magazines royal editor, Laura Hills, told Express. Although they will always be senior members of the royal family any Sussex children will have more freedom to go on to have a career of their own - like Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. There have even been rumours that Meghan and Harry may turn down a royal role for the little one.   Laura added: With so much distance from the throne theyll be allowed to break away from some of the stricter royal conventions and have more freedom to decide which direction their le takes than their cousins. Meghan and Harry will raise their child in Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, close to the Queen and Prince Philip, and their choice of family home will have a signicant impact on how their children are raised. Being out of the city and in the countryside with the possibility of attending fewer public events means Baby Sussex could have a very dferent upbringing to his or her cousins George, Charlotte and Louis - who have been mostly based at Kensington Palace. Much like Princess Diana did for William and Harry, the dad-to-be may want to follow in her footsteps and protect the unborn child from the public eye as much as possible.   Kate Middleton famously posed for post-birth pictures outside the Lindo Wing at St. Marys hospital, but its unclear whether the Sussexes will do this. Meghan reportedly plans to give birth at NHS hospital Frimley Park, near Frogmore Cottage. Danielle reckons that the move to Frogmore and how protective Harry is of his family could mean royal fans wont see much of Baby Sussex. She said: Given that Meghan and Harry are moving to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, I suspect that more steps will be taken to protect the baby’s privacy in the first year or so.  I think Duke and Duchess will release one or two official photos but I doubt we will see their child at any of the official events, such as Trooping the Colour. There are reports thatHarry and Meghan go on a US tour later this year, theyre keen to take the baby with them. But given the level of press attention the couple receive and how protective Harry is of his we, I doubt we will see him or her in public Tune in to the latest episode of Yahoo News series,The Royal Box here."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles inspiring bananas were","story":"NewsMeghan Markles inspiring bananas were NOT given out to sex workersThe Duchess of Sussex wrote messages on the fruit including You are brave and You are strong when she visited Bristol charity One last weekShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video meghan-pens-messages-bananas-food-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen Meghan Markle made goody bags at a charity headquarters earlier this month, she was widely praised for writing inspiring messages for sex workers on bananas.

Newlyweds have been turning to guests’ snaps and ‘selfies’ to salvage memories of their big day. Darren and Adele McDonagh - who ran Treasured Moments Photography - sometimes failed to turn up to capture the happy day, it has been alleged. When they did arrive they are accused of taking blurred images, focused on grooms’ bottoms rather than the brides’ faces and took months to send the pictures -they did at all. Police and Action Fraud are investigating claims the couple conned brides and grooms by promising drones, photo booths, and minute-by-minute capture of the weddings, and pocketed up to pound,.   Chantelle and David Maconochie, of Chester-le-Street, Co Durham, booked Treasured Moments for  June, last year for a romantic white wedding at St Mary’s and St Cuthbert’s Church, in Middle Chair, followed by a reception and party at the Beamish Park Hotel. Mum-of-four Chantelle, , and bus driver Darren, , shelled out pound to book the couple. But only Adele turned up and the newlyweds say she ruined their nuptials by crying and complaining she was depressed and suffering from anxiety over the loss of a baby. Other brides and grooms - more than  couples - have also reportedly complained the McDonaghs blamed hospital appointments, accidents, family bereavements and vandalism for not delivering the promised wedding photos.   Chantelle said: ”When Adele turned up she told me the day was the anniversary of her baby’s death, which put a downer on the day. “She demanded the DJ play the first dance early so she could get home sooner and she was asking me what poses I wanted to do. “She was crying all the time and missed our first kiss and mucked up me walking down the aisle. “For our first dance all she captured was photos of Darren’s butt and when we eventually got the pictures, after months of waiting and complaining, many were out focus and unusable in a wedding album.”   The couple were forced to drive from Chester-le-Street to Leeds to pick up a USB stick with the unedited photographs. Hundreds of disgruntled couples have taken to social media to expose the McDonaghs and warn other brides not to use them - but scores of newlyweds have been left out of pocket and relying on friends’ mobile photos as memories of their wedding day. The McDonaghs, of Leeds, West Yorks, have refunded some brides and have finally delivered images, but many have been left wanting. They have claimed to have gone bankrupt, but there are no court records to back up this. When confronted at home they refused to comment.

Todays weather forecast The Met Office has put a weather warning for wind in place until pm today, while heavy rain is expected in Scotland this afternoon, with risk of flooding in some parts. A separate yellow warning for heavy rain is also in effect for much of the country until the same time. Much of the country will see strong winds and rain showers, some mixed with hale and becoming thundery, meteorologist Alex Burkill said. Its going to be another very windy one, particularly across northern England, Northern Ireland, southern Scotland and northern Wales. Theyre going to have very strong winds. We could therefore see some further problems on roads. As winds ease off later on Saturday, some hill snow is forecast in central and southern parts of England and into Wales, Mr Burkill said, before calmer conditions on Sunday. Thatwill clear through Sunday morning, with blustery showers following behind. Meanwhile, in the north its going to be a fairly bright day. There will be a few showers perhaps and it could turn windy but not as windy as today by any means.

Despite previously working in the UK, Marco - a Portuguese national - has been refused Universal Credit on residency grounds. And Sabrinas monthly allowance leaves the couple and their surviving son, Ruben, with around pound a week to live on, Birmingham Live reports. The couple say their family risks being split up - as former construction site worker Marco, who has suffered from tumours in his right hand, is considering moving back to Portugal despite having been in the country for  years. Both of them have suffered from depression after Tiago’s death on October , .  Marco, , said: “We’ve tried to do everything the correct way, but Universal Credit is the biggest mess ever. “I was receiving benefits as normal as our sons joint carer, he was very, very ill until he passed away. I’d also worked and paid tax in the UK in construction jobs removing asbestos. “After our son passed away we moved houses and I was told to apply for Universal Credit. I showed them all the documents and paperwork, right down to my NHS number, but they decided I wasnt entitled to anything, even though everything was fine before. “Its been a nightmare. We only survive on my partners money, we cant afford clothes and I haven’t had pound in my wallet for the last year.  “Im trying to find work and waiting to see what happens with Brexit but its looking like I’ll have no choice but toto Portugal and leave my family behind.” Marco, who previously claimed Employment and Support Allowance, has needed surgery on his hand to remove the tumours but it constantly swells up and he will need further treatment as well as monitoring to ensure the growths are not cancerous. Sabrina, , has doctor’s notes for depression and anxiety as the basis for her Universal Credit claim that amounts to around pound a month before bills, which include rent, gas and electricity at the housing association home where they live with their six-year-old son Ruben. “By the time we’ve paid the bills we barely have pound to pound a week to spare, and much of that is taken up with bus fares,” said Sabrina. “I’ve had to turn to family to borrow money and to foodbanks.  “We don’t care about ourselves, we just want to give our son the best start in le. “We’ve told them about our bereavement and how we have struggled since but it’s made no dference, they just don’t take into account your needs.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “Ms McCarl receives more than pound a month in Universal Credit, including housing and child support. “We have an obligation to support people who are fully resident in the UK. Mr Simoes has not provided evidence of the right to reside in the UK and therefore is not eligible to receive Universal Credit.

Trey Millward, now , of Robinia Close, Eccles, received a two year community order, including  rehabilitation activity requirement days,  hours unpaid work and a three month curfew. He admitted one count of violent disorder. Prosecutor Andrew MacIntosh told the court that Mr Evans had been enjoying a night out in Eccles town centre with his girlfriend on August , . Later that night they went to McDonalds for some food, where they came across the youths. Mr Evans said that the youths seemed to be weighing him up.   After the pair left McDonalds, words were exchanged. Mr Evans said he would fight them one on one, but not in public. One of the youths was said to reply: We dont use our fists, we use our weapons. Later one of the youths was attacked by another man, and a scuffle broke out. The brawl spread to near the bus station in Church Street, at about .am, when other men and women also became involved in the altercation. As the violence continued, one youth ran at Mr Evans armed with a bladed weapon, slashing him to the face. He sustained two deep cuts, which as well as being serious threatened his boxing career, with the fear that the wounds could re-openhe got in the ring. The other youths and Millward were all involved in lower level confrontations, and most were later identied from CCTV footage. The boy who stabbed Mr Evans at first claimed he had been in bed at the time of the attack. His barrister Ian McMeekin said that his parents believed he was revising, and that he had sneaked out of the house. Mr McMeekin said the evening started out as a good natured night out, before Mr Evans sustained his staggeringly horric injuries.   The barrister described Mr Evans as a heroic victim, due to his conduct after being attacked. The court heard that Mr Evans posted on social media, offering to speak with his attackers. Mr McMeekin said: Hebravely said that he would happily speak to the offenders that caused him those injuries, and told them what it was they they had done, and encouraged them to take violence off the streets. It reflects very well on Mr Evans, Judge Alan Conrad QC said. Sentencing, the judge told the four defendants: Its clear to me that this was group violence, involving the carrying and use of weapons. The four of you were all concerned in dferent ways.   You were all ready to take part in this shocking incident where members of the public passed through the town centre at night. Addressing the -year-old who attacked Mr Evans, the judge added: You were given a bladed weapon and you ran towards Luke Evans, slashing at him, causing him awful injuries. The effect of the attack was very serious, both physically and psychologically. Luke added: Its been really dficult for me, both physically and mentally its been really tough. Ive had counselling and without the support of the people round me I wouldnt be where I am today. I want to thank my partner, plus my training team Ricky Hatton, Blain Younis and Mike Jackson. Theyve all helped me so much. Luke has won each of his three bouts since his comeback last June and is now eyeing a first belt.

One woman thought she and her husband had come up with the perfect name for their son and had worked out a very unique spelling. However two months after giving birth to their child, the mum was horried to discover that the name they had chosen, wasnt actually his legal name - according to the birth certicate.   Writing to Care and Feeding, an advice column on Slate, a woman known only as Mama Bear revealed how she discovered her husband had changed her sons name, without telling her. The American mum claims the incident occurred while she was unconscious and recovering from a C-section. And while shes furious with her husband for not telling her, she knows the real person to blame is her mother-in-law who guilt-tripped him into making the change. The parent wrote: Dear Care and Feeding, my son is two months old, and I just discovered my husband spelled our sons middle name as Finlay instead of Finley on all his legal documentation.   I, of course, am furious, because I told him I was fine with the middle name but it had to be spelled Finley - and he agreed before our son was ever born. She goes on to reveal that she started to suspect something was up when her husbands mother sent a Christmas card to her son, featuring the incorrect spelling. However she only discovered what they had done when she was filing all her sons paperwork away for safe keeping. He just let me keep believing for two months that our sons middle name was spelt Finley when it legally isnt, the outraged mum continued. He says he regretted it as soon as the card came and has been afraid to tell me.   Apparently his mother guilt-tripped him into doing this while I was asleep after my emergency C-section. Keep in mind she lives a few states away, so this was all over the phone. She tried to convince him to give our son a first name that I very much hated, saying that I would get mad, but get over it. My husband thought changing his first name was too much but apparently gave in to spelling his middle name the way his mom wanted. She thinks that Finlay is more masculine that Finley.   The woman goes on to describe the mother-in-law as manipulative and asks whether she should confront her about the whole thing The agony aunt is incredulous and advises not approaching the in-laws as a fistfight might break out. She adds: What in the entire f*** is up with your husband  Hes got to decideyou are his co-parent orhis mother is. And until he makes that decision, he cant be trusted. Period. Purposefully changing the name of your child on a birth certicate behind your back is pretty close to a fireable offenseyou ask me. Im mad just reading about this. You and your kid deserve so much better.

The mum reportedly said yes and several minutes later a car pulled up beside them and the child was snatched away from her. The boy was repeatedly stabbed in the neck with a piece of broken glass until he was beheaded, it is claimed. His helpless mum could only watch and scream as the horror unfolded. Saudi Arabias predominant branch of Islam is Sunni, accounting for around three quarters of the population. Human rights groups say practitioners of other forms of the faith - including Shia - are persecuted.   Shia Rights Watch, a Washington DC-based campaign group, said: There was no intervention from anyone and no response from authority thus far. The Saudi Shia community came together in mourning and to show solidarity with the parents. The community also reported this incident is a result of ongoing violations and lack of protection by the Saudi authority toward its Shia population.  Saudi Shia have been under military crackdown by their government and many Shia are in prisons and on death toll.

She was stunned to see her baby boy covered in hair when he was born. Parvatibai said: “I saw Lalit first half an hour after he was born, I was amazed to see his body covered in extraordinary amount of hair. “We immediately asked the local paediatrician to examine him who trimmed off his excess hair and said that there is no cure for this.   “I have five daughters and we prayed at lot of temples to have a son. Our prayers were answered when Lalit was born. “He is dferent but still very special for me because he was born after many special prayers.” Despite being used to his condition, Lalit often has bad days when due to his excess hair, he faces dficulty in breathing and sight. His parents have tried a number of treatments without success. Lalit’s father, a -year old celery and garlic farmer, Bankatlal Patidar, said: “When Lalit was two years old, I took Lalit to a big hospital in Baroda where a team of doctors examined him.   “After examining him, they told me that there is no cure for it andthey come across any cure, they will inform me.” Lalit often gets jeered and stared at while in public, especially when outside of his native village. “Sometimes when I am out in a busy town, people come and stare at me. Some even call me monkey, he said. “There have been times when other kids throw stones at me and call me names. “But my family and friends come to my rescue and defend me during such incidents.”   He added: I sometimes wish to have some surgery to get rid of excess hair because I want to be friends with everyone. They shouldnt hesitate to play with me. If I didnt have hair Id be fine. No one would bully me. Lalit is very optimistic about his future and wants to join the police force. He said: “I want to join the police and put all thieves and criminals in jail when I grow up. “I want to earn money as an honest policeman and with that I want to look after my mum and dad. “They have done a lot for me and I don’t want any complications for them when they grow old.”   At school, Lalit is an above average student and active in sports. Classmate Dilip Rathore said he was shocked and scared when he first met him but now they are best of friends. Headmaster Babulal Makwana added: “Lalit has been my student for the last two years. He is a good in studies and excels in sports. “He is very popular in his class and everyone is fond of him.

And Beith has been there every step of the way since the club’s foundation in , leading them to promotion to the SWFL Division  North in  before winning that league last year.Although aware of the challenges that face them at this level, the -year-old former Dundee player feels his squad are more than ready to make the step up to the second tier against the likes of Saints, Hamilton, Hearts and Kilmarnock.“Without being disrespectful to the league below, that is all forgotten about and the real work starts now,” Beith said.“In that league we should be winning the vast majority of games and we did.“I expect to win games but we know it’s a step up.“There are a lot of really good teams and that is where we want to be.“You want to step up and tomorrow afternoon against St Johnstone is one of those.“All the games are going to be really dficult to win.“However, that’s the reason why we are committed to doing this and the team is up for it every week, whoever the opposition.”Since celebrating promotion at Tannadice last October with a - win over Cove Rangers Ladies, witnessed by over  fans, Beith has been busy adding to the squad.He hopes that combination of a new season, new players and the recent success of Scotland’s national team qualying for this summer’s World Cup can see crowds increase for the Tangerines this term.He added: “We have the same core of the squad that won promotion last season but we’ve added some quality with the likes of Hannah Coyler, Jenna Penman, Taylor Brackin and Georgia Carter.“We’ve had them in for a while now but they are gelling well and are a really nice bunch.“They have a bit of fire in their bellies and they know it’s going to be a step up but it will be a good experience.“It’s a massive year for women’s football. The last two or three years the publicity around the game has got bigger and bigger.“We hope that encourages fans to come out and support the girls.“They knock their pans in every time they play and they’re just doing it for the love of the game.”And former Arbroath, Brechin City and Forfar midfielder Beith can’t wait to meet the Perth side for the first time and boss his first derby as a manager.“We haven’t really stopped since last season ended, the girls don’t want to,” he added.“We are looking forward to the challenge of St Johnstone tomorrow.“We have never had a derby or played Saints so it will be something extra for both teams, we have to play the game.“The derby element is special.

Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already. Three goals in five appearances have rocketed him to second-top scorer already this season but even when not scoring he gives defences a real headache.Will need support but already looks a real find."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5c36d3189f97.74208600.jpg ","title":"gordon forest backs dundee united to carry on good form against st mirren","story":"Assistant head coach Gordon Forrest has hailed the “leadership” shown by Dundee United’s new recruits.Despite a large chunk of the club’s  new signings arriving on deadline day, manager Robbie Neilson’s assistant Gordon says players like Mark Reynolds, Mark Connolly, Calum Butcher and Peter Pawlett have already shown they’ve got the character to take the Tangerines to the next level.That level is the Premiership and they’ll get a taste of that this weekend when travelling to top-flight St Mirren on Saturday.And Gordon is backing the Tangerines to repeat the display in their - win over Morton last weekend.He said: “The new players didn’t have much contact with the staff and the other players but straight away you could see on the pitch they were right behind what we are trying to do as a club.“There was a good energy about the guys, they were passionate and a bit of leadership came out on the pitch as well. It was so pleasing to see how they slid into that game but also they’ve been on the training pitch this week and it seems like they’ve been here a while.“It can take time to bed in but we can’t have that with  games to go.“It was important we got players in with the right character and mentality and we knew they would fit in straight away.“It’s been great and credit to them for that but also credit to the players already here for reaching out and bringing them in.”The club are hoping for a sell-out of away tickets at St Mirren this week with , of their , allocation already taken up."},{"url":null,"title":"no thanks dundee fans group rejects owners bid for full control of club","story":"Dundee’s most influential supporters group has politely knocked back a bid from Dark Blues owner Tim Keyes to take complete control at Dens Park.Last month it emerged the American millionaire wanted to buy the Dundee FC Supporters’ Society’s ‘A’ Ordinary Shares to take his overall stake in the club to over %.That would have ended the DFCSS’s power of veto over matters like a change of ownership, merger, moving to a new stadium and even substantial borrowing.That’s a condition of the sale of the majority holding Texas-based Keyes took on back in .Only the ‘A’ Ordinary shares that were created then, and are held by the society, include that power of veto.After consulting their -plus members, however, the society have given a thanks but no thanks to the plan for them to be sold.In doing so, however, they have stressed their support “in principal” for the plan to move to a new stadium near the city’s Campderdown Park.And they have stressed their willingness to consider any proposal from Dundee on its merits.The decision of the society’s board reflected the feedback after consulting members.Of that number just over half indicated a preference for holding onto the ‘A Ordinary’ shares but were willing to see a relaxation of certain rights to allow the stadium development to go ahead.Some % were in favour of maintaining the status quo, while % were willing to see the shares sold and a new shareholders agreement negotiated.Another issue is the fact while the existing rules of the DFCSS allow them to buy shares, there is no provision for the sale of any they hold.As well as informing their members, the society board have told Dundee of their decision. It’s one that could leave Keyes and Dundee-based managing director, John Nelms, less than impressed,not surprised.They’ve previously stated the proposed increase in shareholding would have resulted in major tax benefits as they press ahead with the planned Camperdown move.As they informed members and the club of their decision, the society expressed the opinion they’re acting “in the best interests of the society as a whole”.

Increasing the number of cars in the city simply frustrates these efforts. More congestion means buses are less likely to run on time, for instance.He added: ldquoResearch shows that investing in cycling can signicantly improve shop occupancy and town centre spend.

However within a few minutes Star nicked the ball off them and a quick exchange of passes saw Caskie in a position to play a nice through ball for Aitken score with a controlled finish. Despite playing against a strong wind Star were looking the stronger team at this point and a shot from Paterson whizzed past the post. Green was also causing problems down the right for Shettleston. A second goal arrived for Star with McMurchy scoring. Eventually Shettleston started to claw their way back into the game scoring first with a wind assisted  yard free kick and then reacting first to a bouncing ball. Half time -.With the wind in the second half Star started strongly and took the lead again through McMurchy. Whilst possession was evenly balanced Brown, Hoad and Barclay were strong at the back and with Murphy secure in goals and West tidying up in front of them they limited the chances for Shettleston.

However, a good friend of the museum has stepped forward with the offer and agreed to allow Dunadd Community Enterprise time to explore the possibility of buying the building and make a final decision that any community use has the full support of its members and is sustainable.Since the Church of Scotland moved to its new premises in Kilmartin, it has been its intention to sell Kilmartin Church and the Glebe, as well as the churches in Ford, Kilmichael Glassary and Kilmichael of Inverlussa. Kilmartin Museum has been in discussions with the Church of Scotland about buying the Glebe to use for their education programmes, and to develop overflow parking in a small area to accommodate the extra visitors expected when the redeveloped museum opens in .At the recent AGM, members of Dunadd Community Enterprise supported the committee to go ahead with seeking funding to commission a full feasibility study that would explore sustainable community use of the building. Funds would be required to buy, renovate and convert the church.There have been lots of ideas and discussion, but careful business planning is required to ensure whatever the church is used for would attract grant funding and crucially, would be sustainable in the long term. This will take some time and funding needs to be sought for a feasibility study in the first instance, so Dunadd Community Enterprise could not currently buy the church.Kilmartin Museum already has funding in place to purchase the Glebe Field, and they need to go ahead with this to keep to their redevelopment project timescales. However, the benefactor has said it will be possible to maintain public access to the historic stones housed in the church and that the museum can also use the building while the building work required during the redevelopment project is taking place.Dr Sharon Webb, museum director said: ‘It would have been a real shamethe church and the historic stones had become inaccessible, and this decision by the church head office could have presented real dficulties to both the museum and community enterprise, so it’s great that a temporary solution has been found. It’s wonderful that there are such generous and philanthropic people who want to make a dference to both the museum and the local community.’David Bracken, chairman of the Dunadd Community Enterprise, added: ‘This gives us the time we need to explore all the possibilities and make sure thatwe do go ahead and raise funds to buy the church, it’s the right thing for the community now, and for future generations.’Negotiations between the Church of Scotland head office and the anonymous buyer are ongoing."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert blow after festivals funding bid rejected","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is undeniably the festival capital of Argyll, but organisers say two summer events in the fishing village will be #diminished# after council cash was refused.Tarbert Enterprise Company submitted bids to Argyll and Bute Council#s Strategic Events and Festivals Grant Scheme for three events # Tarbert Scottish Series , Tarbert Music Festivaland Tarbert Seafood Festival .The bids for the music and seafood festivals were rejected in their entirety, while the Scottish series yachting event was granted £,.John Hardie, chairman of Tarbert Enterprise Company, said the two high-profile summer festivals would be #diminished# after failing to receive council support.#It#s pretty devastating when you think you#ve put a good bid together,# said Mr Hardie.He questioned why three large events # Cowal Highland Gathering, Tiree Music Festival and Oban Live # should receive around  per cent of the total funding allocation of £,.Mr Hardie asked: #Are these events being generously funded at the expense of others #He added: #A contribution would have been acceptable.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy. Instead, they have decided to raid the pockets of hard-working families.,params: .pushMr Bell added: ldquoMy big message to the Borders Tories is to drop their mentality of dependence and to take responsibility for balancing a Borders budget. ldquoThe power to make change is in the hands of the council and they should stop trying to shirk local responsibility. Power to finance - expenditure is in the hands of the administration.ldquoDerek MacKay has announced that more could be raised from further increasing the local council tax to a new upper level of over %, as the Scottish Government has lted the previous cap.ldquoFurther, the Tory-led Borders administration should take responsibility for properly managing our councilrsquos affairs. ldquoFigures I have seen show that there are unrealised savings of over pound.m that were planned in last yearrsquos budget which have not been realised in practice.ldquoIf these saving had been made, then there would be less cuts this year.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion.ldquoPeople have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge.

I learned to swim in there. I remember when I was a teenager we used to occasionally go down there to the skating because that is the place you went to maybe meet lassies at the weekend.\"He chuckles softly. \"Butyou couldnt skate, you werent going to meet anybody, slipping around the edges. One of the first jobs I did out of drama school was a panto at the Magnum.\"Having suitably recovered from my accidental bombshell, our conversation turns to his role as everyones favourite brooding detective inspector Jimmy Perez which will see the -year-old actorto our screens for a fth series this week.It has been quite the journey so far. Did Henshall imagine when he embodied Perez for that two-part pilot which aired in  ndash adapted from the novel Red Bones by crime writer Ann Cleeves ndash that he would inhabit the character for seven years and counting \"Obviously, no,\" he says, wryly. \"Because you never know. I thought he was an interesting character and there was possibility. But I didnt think it would last very long in that two-part format. I wasnt particularly interested in doing another cop show that way because it is a pretty dated concept.\"The Scandis blew the crime genre out of the water and the Americans have been doing interesting things with it for years. We had to be brave and follow on with that. I was trying to convince them from the beginning to do six hours on one story.\"Testament to that early vision, Shetland has evolved into a six-part series. Previous storylines have shone a spotlight on a miscarriage of justice and laid bare the emotional aftermath of rape, with the latest instalment centring on the hidden brutality of human trafficking.It opens with a young man inexplicably alone and shivering on a windswept hillside. He is last seen walking towards a vehicle. A few days later, a jogger discovers a severed hand on the beach, while a holdall found at nearby inlet reveals grisly contents: a human head.Forensic tests confirm that they belong to the same victim, a visitor spotted passing through Lerwick. As Perez and the team scrutinise CCTV, emails and social media accounts, the investigation takes an even darker and more sinister twist.\"People trafficking, refugees and migration is a huge issue in Europe and indeed all over the world at the present moment,\" says Henshall. \"But the ways in which that starts and the abuses that take place during the course of peoples journeys has certainly opened my eyes.\"[It has opened them] to the places that can happen and the very insidious ways it happens in places you would never imagine and by seemingly respectable people.\"Shetland has always deftly sidestepped the gratuitous violence and so-called \"misery porn\" that many crime dramas trade on, instead forging its own path through weighty subject matter and thought-provoking themes.Henshall casts his mind back to series three when Perezs colleague DS Alison \"Tosh\" McIntosh ndash played by the brilliant Alison ODonnell ndash was raped.\"When I heard that Tosh was going to be raped, I was aghast,\" he says. \"Because I thought, Why would we do that  Ninety percent of the time when you see rape on the television it is gratuitous and there to either bolster viewing figures or as a lazy way of treating female cast.\"Thankfully our show, at that time, was very much headed up by women, which has benefited us hugely. The way in which we approached that ndash how it was written and carried out ndash I thought it was much more responsible and the way it should be done.\"A lot of it is down to our writers and the people who produce our show. Then, of course, you have actors and directors who are empathetic and capable of being able to perform things like that.\"Tosh didnt feature in Cleeves books: Perezs bright and ambitious right-hand woman is the brainchild of the shows lead writer David Kane whose past credits include The Field of Blood, Stonemouth, Sea of Souls, Taggart and Rebus.\"Davey Kane is somebody who likes women and I think that comes across,\" says Henshall. \"Everything he has ever written ndash and I have known Davey for, Christ, over  years ndash he likes women. Tosh is his invention and he has been writing women like that for as long as I have known him.\"There is a great deal of responsibility that goes into the subject matter and how it is explored. It is never for the sake of it because there are too many good bulls*** detectors in our set-up for it to get passed.\"Would Henshall call out that kind of thing  \"Absolutely,\" he says, a steely glint in his eye. \"Because I am front and centre, I have to be able to stand up and support whatever we do.\"He speaks highly of his Shetland co-stars, yet Henshall can be his own worst critic. \"Im not very good at being objective about myself,\" he admits. \"I tend to think: What are you doing  Look at you, you big, bleary-eyed, fat f***.\"Cleeves bid farewell to Perez in her final Shetland novel, Wild Fire, last autumn. Im fully expecting Henshall to wax lyrical about the character living on within the small screen but he instead throws a curveball. \"Yeah, Im not sure how many more miles it has got,\" he says. \"But well see.\"The youngest of three children, Henshall grew up in Barrhead and as a teenager joined the Scottish Youth Theatre. His late mother was a nurse while his father, a retired salesman, recently ed to live in Barrhead following several years in Cyprus.After leaving school, Henshall trained at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London and later did a stint with the : company in Glasgow.His first television acting role was as a motorcyclist in Taggart Peter Mullan and Ewen Bremner before going on to parts in Dennis Potters Lipstick on Your Collar and the films Angels and Insects, Orphans and Its All About Love.Recent years have brought high-profile roles in the popular time-travelling drama Outlander and playing police detective William Muncie in the ITV mini-series In Plain Sight, about the Lanarkshire serial killer Peter Manuel.Last year Henshall spent six months opposite Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston and Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery in an acclaimed National Theatre production of Network. The actor says that he would happily do a play every yearhe could.There has been a change of scene too. In November, he moved to Glasgow with his we Tena Stivicic, a Croatian-born playwright and screenwriter, and their two-year-old daughter Anja Grace. Slowly but surely, says Henshall, the trio are settling into their new home in the citys west end.\"I have never lived in Glasgow before,\" he says. \"It is slightly discombobulating because Im very used to it over the last seven years but not for living here. I lived in London for  years, so it is quite odd, but we are in a lovely part of town.\"What prompted their move  \"Mainly my daughter. We needed to move to somewhere bigger. We couldnt really afford that in London. We could have bought somewhere but I would have been mortgaged up to my neck and probably had a stroke in  years. I thought, Its not worth it.\"Then there is the thing with schools in London. We have got pals who are having to go to church on a Sunday just to get their daughter into a decent school ndash catchment areas are the size of a -bob bit.\"There is something to be said for kids growing up in London becausethey grow up there, they can go anywhere. But we werent sure that we wanted her growing up quite that quick.\"We could get a house here that we would never be able to get in London. Our quality of le is going to be an awful lot better. But Glasgow wasnt the only place we were thinking of moving to.\"Somewhere more rural, perhaps  \"Oh, God no. Coming from London, this feels like I have moved to the country,\" laughs Henshall. \"We were thinking about Glasgow but then, why not Zagreb where Tena is from \"Then we thought we could maybe go to Los Angeles for a year ndash my we and I have both got representation there ndash but it was Tena who said: Lets find somewhere in Glasgow.\"And is she settling in  He nods. \"Yeah, but I think she is still in the slight mourning phase for London.\"Henshall alludes to his own sense of mourning. \"The only thing I really miss since we came up here is the theatre. Because the theatre scene in Glasgow is dead.\"Why does he think that is  \"The fact that consecutive governments in Scotland still see the arts as a hobby. That is why we are still talking about film studios in Scotland. I have been talking about it for  years ndash and we are still talking about it.\"It is not seen as a viable, money-making, profit-making industry. It is still seen by the people in power as a hobby. And it is a disgrace that people are still that ignorant after this amount of time.\"Hes warming to his theme now. \"The Citizens Theatre in Glasgow used to be one of the most important theatres in Europe.

The great thing that Giles [Havergal], Philip Prowse and Robert David MacDonald did was to make a theatre in Gorbals a community theatre.\"That takes work and imagination.

Although we have got room in our house now, so I could, but I think she might shoot me.\"He clearly craves the outdoors le, something Henshall hopes his daughter will share. \"Now we have moved up here there will be a lot more scope for getting out in the country for walks,\" he says. \"The bigger she gets Im sure she will love that. I want her to be an outside person.\"Henshall is reticent on what work projects he has in the pipeline. \"There is a couple of interesting things kicking about but I dont want to talk about them because I dont want to curse them,\" he says.What about burning ambitions  \"I would like to work in America. But I am past that overly ambitious phase of my le. I would like to stay as relevant as I possibly can as an actor.\"I want to keep working on things that are going to push me and are intellectually interesting with subject matter that is relevant and exciting.

Unemployment here in East Ayrshire is twice the national average.Soon the secondary school will shut, to be merged in to a new campus in neighbouring Cumnock.

It#s anticipated this work will start on February  and could take four weeks to complete.The current one-way system means drivers can turn into Castle Street from Junction Road and on into Broad Street but vehicles do not have access from Palace Road into Broad Street.A signed ersion via Clay Loan is in place. In addition, vehicles cannot turn into Castle Street from Albert Street – but can drive on into Broad Street.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which will see improvements to the area at the bottom of the Strynd, the creation of a new path to the War Memorial at St Magnus and improvements at the head of Victoria Street.The council has said the works at the top of Castle Street will see new paving and road surfacing laid, and the road surface raised to pavement level.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority. When the planning application is submitted, an opportunity will be given for representations to be made to the Planning Authority.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was due to start its final phase of construction this year but it was axed from the councilrsquos capital programme in last yearrsquos budget.Then in March, funding for transport improvements in Dingwall was found to enable some housing development to take place prior to the commencement of the KLR.A transport study and modelling work considered the impact of ious levels of development in the town and improvements will include work at the Bridgend Avenue Junction and Docharty Road Junction as well as traffic signal works at Mart Road Junction. Proposals for walking and cycling improvements and traffic management measures will also be brought forward to enhance active travel facilities in the town.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Graham Mackenzie said: ldquoIt would be tempting to see it as a good news story for Dingwall. That is not the case. Had we been given what we were promised in an earlier iteration of the capital plan we could be releasing up to  houses for development instead of around .\"Instead the KLR was taken out of the capital plan even though the first phase of the project had already started. If Dingwall is to grow and provide the range of housing which is required, the KLR must be moved up the list of priorities. This project needs to be reinstated.Fellow ward councillor Angela Maclean insisted the deal was good news. She said: ldquoWe as councillors have a leadership role and it is up to us to be helping our communities to move forward and this report has examples of when officers have looked for solutions to get round some of the fact that we donrsquot have all the money we would like.\"Whether it is through the infrastructure road plans or capital fund we are going to try and move forward with these houses in Dingwall, because Dingwall is a pressurised area ndash this is a positive move because we donrsquot have enough houses in Dingwall.Saturday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_9_21-Barcelona-by-Xavier-Mercade-5-Copy.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Nowadays even the most hard to wake sleepers have bleepers, bells and even the dulcet tones of Alexa at their bedside to ensure they get up for work in time.But in times gone by, it wasn’t just a case of a verbal shot across the bows from the bossyou turned up late for work - back in the so-called ‘good old days’ it could mean the loss of a day’s pay or maybe even your job. And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes. Andthis is why communities across the Northern Ireland have formed these community first responder schemes.Volunteers are trained, and dispatched at the same time as the responding ambulance crew, by NIAS.The Braid Valley is now joining this movement.Leonard Wharry, the scheme coordinator, explained: We aim to go live in early summer with a scheme covering Ballymena, Broughshane and the surrounding rural areas.Were raising money for defibrillators and other equipment, but our priority is to recruit and train volunteers. People who live and work locally, who can make themselves available to respond and who meet our other requirements.”If you are interested in finding out more about the Braid Valley Community First Responder Scheme, the scheme organisers, NIAS and Dalriada Urgent Care are hosting an open evening at  pm on Wednesday February  at:NIAS North Division HQ –  Antrim RoadBallymena.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

Ned’s family were local ruffians and his father, Red Kelly was deported to Australia for stealing two pigs. After his deportation Red Kelly went gold prospecting and earned enough money to buy a small freehold in Victoria, where the family gained a reputation for cattle rustling. Ned was born in .In , Red was jailed for stealing and skinning a calf. He became ill and died soon after his release.Ned assaulted a Chinese pig farmer called Ah Fook. He wasn’t convicted because Ah Fook was said to be abusing Ned’s sister Annie, When Ned tried to defend her Fook gave him a good beating.After that Ned had several brushes with the law including the bizarre offense of being accused of riding a policeman like a horse!Serious trouble occurred In  when constable Alexander Fitzpatrick went to the Kelly homestead to arrest Ned’s younger brother, Dan. Afterwards Fitzpatrick said his wristhad been injured when Ned shot him three times and Ned’s mother, Ellen, hit him on the head with a shovel! Fitzpatrick was treated by a doctor who said he did not believe the injury was caused by gunshot wounds.Historians think Fitzpatrick was an unreliablewitness because three years he lost his job in the police force when he was found guilty of perjury and drunkenness.Ned and Dan became outlawsand went on the run along with their friends Steve Hart and Joe Byrne. As the police closed in the gang attempted to steal weapons from four officers. One of the officers went for his gun and Ned shot him dead. The Kelly gang committed many crimes before taking their last stand against the police,at Glenrowan, where Kelly donned his homemade metal armour which has become a powerful symbol in Australian artNed was captured, tried and convicted on three counts of murder. On November ,  he was led from his cell in Melbourne Gaol at am and hung. The hangman, Elija Upjohn worked quickly. Contemporary accounts say Elija Upjohn was an appallingly ugly man with a huge festering carbuncle on the end of his nose. It was his first execution and he appeared very nervous.Popular legend records Ned Kelly’s last words as ‘Such is le’,He remains a prominent figure among Australia’s anti heroes being seen by some as a common criminal and by others as symbolizing national Irish-Australian resistance to unfair government. Ned Kelly’s torso was thrown into a mass graveat the Old Melbourne Jail after his execution.His head was removed and handed to phrenologists so they couldstudy its ‘bumps’for evidence of criminal activity.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Bodies in mass graves are dficult to identy. There’s no means of identying which set of bones belong to whom. However during the final Glenrowan Ned Kelly boots and sash, which were given to him as a reward for rescuing a drowning teenager, became splattered in his blood.He was buried with hissash and boots on so the bones near the boots were presumed to belong to him. Samples of that blood were used for DNA testing which in  confirmed bones found in a mass grave at Melbourne’s Pentridge Prison belonged to Ned Kelly.Ned’s family constantly campaigned to be allowed to give him a proper burial. His last wish was that his remains should lie beside his mother in the family plot at Gretna. In January  his wish came true. His headless body was given a proper burial. Joanne Grfiths, the great-granddaughter of Kelly’s sister Kate said,‘We’ve made a real effort to ensure that he’s going to be safe and he’s surrounded by family and friends, which is the way he would have wanted it.’Now what about the head A head, thought to belong to Ned Kelly, was put on display when the old gaol was turned into a museum in , but unfortunately it was stolen. Since then two heads have turned up!Well, I suppose two heads are better than one!The first was reported on th August  in ‘ The New Zealand Herald on Sunday’that a Kiwi Witch called Anna Hoffman, a  year old New Zealand woman, said she had been given Ned’s head by a mysterious unormed man, who told her‘to put it in the bottom of our cupboard and wrap it up’ after a family dinner party in . She collected skulls and had more than . Deb Withers, a spokesman for the Victorian Institute of Forensic Science said, ‘There is a chance that it is Ned’s head, although it is a long shot.’Gina McFarlane, a forensic expert at Auckland University said she thought the wires sticking out of the skull suggested it had been used as a teaching aid which made it unlikely to have belonged to Ned Kelly.The second head turned up when Tom Baxter, a farmer from the remote town of Derby in Western Australia, gave a skull to the Victorian institute of Forensic Medicine saying he believed it to be Ned Kelly’s. I understand both heads are currently undergoing genetic testing.Ned Kelly, still has an influence in Australia today.A news item on January nd  in Australia’s ‘The Dailydescribed a manhunt by Strike Force Trevana searching for Graeme Smith, who has a distinct tattoo of Ned Kelly at the front of his neck,Graeme got in an argument with with his friend Josh George, shot him in the chest with a rfle and, like Ned Kelly, went on the run.

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will. That’s nice, and the traditional music community are great.” Gradam recipients, who represent the crème de la crème of traditional music and song, will be joined in live performances on stage by their own special musical guests, including Irish fiddler Paddy Glackin, Michael McCague and multi-instrumentalist Sinéad Egan, to name but a few. A range of VIP guest presenters will also take to the stage last year, actor Stephen Rea and President Michael D.

People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":null,"title":"catholics to be majority of workforce in northern ireland for first time in 2020 new","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

EirGrid is managing the southern end, which connects the line across counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath.SONIs proposal was originally approved by the Department for Infrastructurein January  in the absence of a minister. It followed a public inquiry and a report published by the Planning Appeals Commission.The project has always been controversial with landowners in Tyrone and Armagh, with more than , letters of objection lodged to the original plan.The legal action brought by SEATwas partly based on last years High Court ruling, which found that a senior civil servant did not have the power to grant planning permission for a controversial incinerator in Mallusk, Co Antrim. DfI said that after considering the High Court ruling and new legislation passed by Parliament, it decided that mounting a defence to SEATs challenge would not be in the public interest.\"This means that the application willto the department for its consideration, and this will allow departmental officials to actively progress this high profile application to a stage where it is once again ready for a decision to be made,\" said a spokesperson.\"At the point where a decision is ready to be made, andthere is a continued absence of ministers, the department will consider whether to issue a decision in accordance with the powers available to it at that time.\"Jim Lennon from SEAT said the plan for a new cross-border power line must go back to the drawing board, and harness new technology. The group has always promoted the idea of placing the lines underground on health grounds.\"I think it has to go back to a fundamental consideration of the strategic issues of what Northern Ireland needs to have in terms of an energy policy and where this fits into it,\" said the Armagh resident.SONI general manager Robin McCormick said the body was hopeful that the new powers for civil servants would enable its planning applications to be re-determined by DfI without delay.Business organisations have backed SONI and called for DfI to use the new powers to advance the interconnector.Construction Employers Federation managing director John Armstrong said yesterdays decision was \"highly regrettable\" and added: \"Urgent delivery is absolutely critical to our economic fortunes into the future.\"Chief executive of NI Chamber, Ann McGregor, said: \"We strongly encourage the Department for Infrastructure to re-determine the application as a matter of priority.\""},{"url":null,"title":"merchant hotel plans expansion into ulster sports club","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Belfastunderstands that it will be debated as a separate motion.Mr Dallat said that while the only partnership option currently on the table is the deal with Fianna Fail, that would not block partnership relationships with other parties on specic issues going forward.\"Weve been building relationships with political parties on the side since our inception,\" he said.\"I dont see how that is ever going to end just because of a partnership with Fianna Fail on particular aspects of politics.\"The partnership is with Fianna Fail at the minute because thats the one available - it doesnt rule out sometime in the future that there might be parallel partnerships with other political parties.\"But at the minute the only partnership that is on offer is the one with Fianna Fail.\"That will take an enormous amount of endeavour by both parties to achieve it. And its very specic on what it intends to do.\"If the party comes up with partnerships with other political parties Ill listen to them in the same way Ive done with this one and Ill be persuaded, and on this one I am persuaded. \"Its certainly innovative and its new, but partnerships in themselves are not new.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"we can do a brexit deal says dups foster after talks with taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Northern Ireland should stand as a reminder to the Taoiseach of how we have overcome many greater obstacles in the past,\" she said.Mr Varadkar said everybody wanted to avoid a no-deal and a hard border and \"to continue to have a very close political and economic relationship between Britain and Ireland no matter want happens\".He said: \"There is much more that unites us than ides us and time is running short, and we need to get to an agreement really as soon as possible, and Ill be working very hard and redoubling my efforts, along with government, to do that.\"He insisted that while the backstop was not up for renegotiation, \"we can talk about the joint political declaration and what changes might be made to that and what assurances may be given that would assist this agreement being ratied\".Asked about the controversial comment of European Council president Donald Tusk that there was a \"special place in Hell\" for Brexiteers without a plan, Mr Varadkar pointed to anti-EU political rhetoric.\"It was only a few months ago that people in the UK Government were comparing the European Union to communism and bear in mind President Tusk spent much of his le fighting to overthrow communism,\" he said.\"So I think there has been a lot of rhetoric coming from a lot of dferent quarters and I think the best thing to do is just to rise above it.\"The DUP leader said it was important for Mr Varadkar to understand that unionist views on the backstop could not be ignored.\"The EU must respect that, for unionists, a new border east-west is no more acceptable than a new border north-south,\" she said. \"The draft withdrawal agreement was unacceptable because it would cut Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK and create a democratic deficit in Belfast.\"We will test any new draft withdrawal agreement against its impact on the Union and whether it respects the referendum result.\"She declined to be drawn on whether alternative proposals to the backstop had been discussed during the meeting. The DUP leader said she wasnt enthusiastic about extending Article a Brexit deal wasnt reached by March .\"What we are focused on is trying to find a deal. That is where everybody should be focused, and not focused on extending the time further,\" she said.\"Because I think, as you know, here in Northern Irelandyou give more time often you dont get the outcome.\"DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who also attended the meeting, said he believed a Westminster majority for a Brexit deal could be found with his partys MPs and some Labour rebels voting with the Tories.Speaking after her meeting with Mr Varadkar, Sinn Feins vice president Michelle ONeill said: \"I think the Taoiseach has remained firm throughout the negotiation in recognising the need to protect Irish interests, in recognising the need to make sure that citizens in the North are never left behind.\"He restated that commitment to us today. At the end of the day we will hold the Taoiseachs feet to the fire on the issue.\"She added: \"Any retreat from it would jeopardise Irish interests, the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. With the exception of the unionist parties, there is political unanimity north and south on the need to protect the backstop.\"Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said there must be \"realism\" in Dublin about unionists backstop concerns.\"The dismissal of these concerns will inevitably have long lasting consequences for relationships north and south of the border,\" he said.\"Equating opposition to the backstop as beckoning theof violence is an extremely dangerous and foolhardy position for the Republic of Irelands Government to take.\"It is providing justication in advance for those who may attempt to turn the clock back.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party had a positive meeting with the Taoiseach and said it was reassuring that he had reiterated his support for the backstop.Last nights one-on-one between Mr Varadkar and Mrs May came at the request of the British Government at the end of a week when she has travelled to Belfast and Brussels.Her team was warned in advance by Irish officials that while they were happy to host her, any Brexit discussions could only be interpreted as \"talk\".They stressed Ireland negotiates its position through the European Unoin taskforce led by Michel Barnier.Mr Varadkar said the meeting was an opportunity \"to share our perspectives and for us to listen to each other\".\"There is much more that unites us than ides us and time is running short,\" he said.The Prime Minister is believed to have used the meeting to explain her desire for legally binding changes to the Brexit deal.This has been repeatedly ruled out by Mr Varadkar and key EU leaders.How you voted in our online pollAn online Belfastpoll has found that readers are narrowly against the Brexit backstop.Our unscientic Facebook poll asked readers to vote for or against the proposal in the Withdrawal Agreement.Over , people have taken part in the vote, with % saying they were against the backstop and % voting in favour of keeping it.The controversial backstop proposal is intended to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.It has become a major sticking point of the Brexit negotiations, with hardline Conservatives and the DUP opposing the plan, which led to the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May in the House of Commons last month.The DUP has said that it believes the backstop plan would create a trade border in the Irish Sea and could leave Northern Ireland tied to the EU indefinitely.It would only come into effecta trade deal is not reached between the EU and UK during the -month Brexit transition period.Under the plan the UK would effectively remain inside the EU’s customs union, with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market until a deal is reached.The Irish Government and EU have remained steadfast in their view that the backstop is the best way of preventing a hard border in Ireland.MPs voted to replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements”, with Prime Minister Theresa May ing to Brussels on Thursday in an attempt to renegotiate her deal.Mrs May described discussions with EU leaders as “robust but constructive” and insisted she was determined to “negotiate hard” over the coming days."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn option of second referendum remains open if brexit deal rejected","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These standard quality checks are carried out every three months, in line with UK best practice.The Western Trust said it immediately set up a review team, alerted the Public Health Agency and Department of Health and initiated the review process.  As a result of the review, a total of  women have been asked to arrange repeat smear test with their GP.Of the  women affected,  of them are from the Western Trust area,  women from the Belfast and South Eastern Trust areas and  women from the Republic of Ireland.Dr Dermot Hughes, Medical Director of the Western Trust, said: “The women affected will have received letters inviting them to contact their GP to arrange a repeat smear test. This does not necessarily mean that the results of their initial test were wrong the repeat test is a precautionary measure to provide reassurance that all women are being followed up appropriately.“I understand that this may cause worry and inconvenience for the women affected and I sincerely apologise for this. I would like to reassure everyone that the samples that were reviewed were a small percentage of those screened and reported between April  and June .“The stringent quality checks that are in place have reassured us that it was only a certain number of tests within this timeframe that were required to be re-examined.” ‘Le-saving’Sinn Féin Councillor Caoimhe McKnight has said her party has requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust.The Derry councillor recently encouraged local women to have regular Smear Tests as she reflected on her own experience with the “le-saving” procedure.Cllr. McKnight said: “I can speak from experience when I say that a Smear Test could literally save your le.  When living in Scotland at the age of , which is the age there at which you are eligible for a smear, I received the notication of my eligibility and advised to avail of it.“But like many young women I put it off for a couple of months before finally going for the test.  When I tell you how grateful I am that I made the decision to have the test it is no exaggeration.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It was luckythat I made the decision to have the test as they found abnormal cells.  I dread to think what I may have been toldI had to wait until the age of  before being tested.“After treatment and a few yearly smears everything is now fine and I am now in the normal  year test cycle.”She said it will be a “distressing” time for the women recalled but urged them all to contact their GPs to schedule a repeat smear test as soon as possible.\"While the Western Trust have said that this is a precautionary measure it will still cause concern and worry so it is important the affected women do not face undue delay in receiving a repeat test.\"In June ,  women in Belfast and Newtownabbey were also invited to attend for repeat smear test after the Public Health Agency were made aware of concerns identied in April that year.\"As I understand it, the Western Trust’s review of cervical smear tests concerned those in April and June , but it is not clearthere is a connection with what happened in Belfast and Newtownabbey in June and this recent action by the Western Trust.\"Sinn Féin have requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust and we will be raising these concerns directly with them,\" she added.‘Mistakes’Meanwhile, SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins told women to call the Western Trust helpline, to allay any concerns.Cllr Dobbins commented: “This is not the first time mistakes have been made in regards to cervical screening laboratories lessons should and must be learnt from issues both in the South and in England.“Undoubtedly this recall will be a cause of concern for many women. However, I must stress the fact that only a fraction of those tested between April to June  were affected and will receive letters this week to arrange a repeat test with their GP.“This does not necessarily indicate that initial results were incorrect, rather the recall is a precautionary measure intended to allay concerns.”The Western Trust has advised the affected women thatthey have any

Hannaway reflected upon the organisationrsquos work over the past year during the annual rates meeting.He said the organisation continued to deliver on both the services and key projects that were agreed in its current four-year corporate plan which ends in , working to improve the local authorityrsquos recycling rates, both for blue and brown bin collections, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under this initiative include an archaeological dig near Down Cathedral which will help provide more information on the legacy of St Patrick and a cross-community choir aimed at establishing and developing new

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

It literally became a tidal wave of women going, lsquoYes Me Too, Yes Me Too, Yes Me Toorsquo.ldquoSexual assault is everywhere.It has been normalised. It has been accepted. Until we are shining a proper light on this, we need this to happen.ldquoIt has always been that way. Where did the phrase the casting coach come from  It is as old as the hills. It is accepted language. Because it is accepted language, do we have to accept that some women are going to have to be violated in order to get ahead in the industry ldquoI think its is abhorrent and I think that the way that women are portrayed on screen and how they are treated in the industry is rightly changing.However, McGrady, who is a former student of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, defended the storyline behind The Fall which shows Jamie Dornan playing Phil Spector, a serial killer of young women.ldquoI thought it was an excellent examination at to what would compel a man to violence against women, she said.The youngest of five children, McGrady also talks about feeling ldquodeeply emotional about the Mourne Mountains.She also touches on her need as a young girl to leave Castlewellan once she had left school ldquofor some adventure anywhere and how she has experienced mental health problems in the past with feelings of anxiety and depression.McGrady, who is now married and living in London, also speaks of the ups and downs of her acting career and how after she performed Macbeth with Sir Patrick Stewart in the West End and on Broadway in New York, she ed to London to work in a club.bull Eamonn Mallie mdash Face to Facehellipwith Niamh McGrady airs on UTV on Tuesday at .pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Centenary celebrations for Hollymount Pipe Band anniversary  ","story":"THERErsquoS a saying around these parts by those who know mdash lsquotherersquos two things you canrsquot get away from, farming and pipe bandsrsquo.Born just after the ending of the Great War in  and reformed after World War Two in , Hollymount Pipe Band is marking its centenary this year.It was the first pipe band formed in the Lecale district and sadly, it is the only one remaining out of eight.While the faces have changed over the years, therersquos one thing that hasnrsquot and thatrsquos the deep-rooted family connections between its members over the decades.Despite the advert of streamed TV box-sets, the internet and smart phone that increasingly take up much of our spare time, family ties between the generations remain strong here.In , there were six father-son combinations playing in the band which practices at Hollymount Orange Hall on the Woodgrange Road just outside Downpatrick.Today, within its -strong ranks, aged from three years to , are four father-child relationships with lead drummer Ronnie Steele going for the record with three of his four young daughters in the band.Sammy Strain is the bandrsquos elder statesman. He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened. Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science. Temporary classrooms make no provision for these subjects, which form over half of the curriculum, he explained.The headmaster told parents that since the school opened  years ago, with accommodation for  pupils, no extra provision had been made for practical subjects to facilitate the pupils now on the roll.ldquoNo matter which way the problem of accommodation is resolved the pupils are being discriminated against in regard to the subjects they can choose, he continued.ldquoFor  years chairs and tables have had to be carried in and out for the gymnasium and for  years the Department of Education has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of both the management and the South Eastern Education Board.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Marlene Fitzsimons is to represent Northern Ireland in the finals of the Miss British Legion contest in England in May.Marlene, representing the Downpatrick branch, won the Northern Ireland heats in the county town on Friday night and will now travel to the national finals to be held in Brighton.Miss Fitzsimons, from Roughal Park, beat entries from Dungannon, Omagh and Belfast, as well as last yearrsquos winner, Andrea Quinn, from Comber.The four points that the judges were looking for were Legion knowledge, Legion involvement, poise and appearance, and diction and clarity of expression.MOURNES mdash Newcastlersquos Shimna River has been ped as one of the water extraction rivers for the proposed new multi-million-pound reservoir at Kinnahalla in the Mourne Mountains.The news, announced late last night from Stormont, will be welcomed in Newcastle where there have been fears that the Shimna would dry upwater was taken for the new scheme.ldquoIt has been decided not to proceed with the abstraction intake on the Shimna River because of the possible affect a further abstraction might have on the river, said a spokesman for the Department of the Environment.ldquoIn addition the Department has agreed that a residual flow of water from the Fofanny reservoir should now be provided for the upper reaches of the Shimna and Fofanny rivers which will result in improvement downstream, especially in times of low flows and will also ensure that the amenity value of the Shimna to Tollymore Forest Park will be retained.Newcastle councillor Paddy OrsquoDonoghue said the announcement would be seen as a major victory for people opposed to the proposal.The new reservoir, which is being built on the upper reaches of the Bann downstream from the existing Spelga reservoir, will help meet the growing demand in the Belfast area, which is now approaching  million gallons a day and will also augment supplies to those parts of Co Down not at present supplied from existing Mourne sources.ARDGLASS mdash The badly decomposed body of a man was found on the rocks at Sheepland, Ardglass, on Monday morning.

The front door still has its peep hole and numerous locks, but the interior certainly does not resemble a station. The cells have become the kitchen and the remaining rooms have been completely renovated.Because of its similarity with other police stations the current owners have had several amusing incidents when people have called looking for directions, or asking for stray drunks to be locked up for the night.A spokesman for the estate agents agreed that it was one of the most unusual buildings to appear on the property market and added that it would suit anyone worried about security problems!NEWCASTLE mdash Provisional plans for Newcastlersquos summer fun programme mdash the centrepiece of Down Districtrsquos holiday entertainment mdash are already being drawn up.Newcastle Town Committee mdash the local body which co-ordinates the summer programme mdash held its annual convention last week and preparations for this yearrsquos programme got underway.Members of the town committee have pledged their determination to make this yearrsquos event even bigger and better than before.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/entertainment/ource srcset=/resources/images/9397209.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

They are a critical organisation in the electricity sector here. It would be dficult to convey the importance of the job that our members do. “Put simply, things won’t work without them. In light of that, the decision to ballot for industrial action is one that has not been taken lightly.”Outlining workers’ concerns, she continued: “Each year, there is a negotiation for a cost-of-living pay award. Since  there hasn’t been one. There are pay claims which are three years in dispute, going into a fourth year. You can see by theof time this has been going on that this is not a reckless act, it is with absolute reluctance that our members are being faced with this decision.”She added: “We are aware of concerns from members about the independence of SONI, its relationship with EirGrid and EirGrid’s relationship with the Irish government. As far as we are concerned, we are negotiating with SONI. We are not negotiating with EirGrid. The bottom line for us is pay, or the lack of pay for more than three years.”‘Urgent’ need to get N S interconnector built Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"A spokesperson for SONI said: “We are disappointed that SONI staff, who are members of the Prospect Union, are actively proceeding with a formal ballot for industrial action in relation to a pay claim.“SONI has already offered independent arbitration through the Labour Relations Agency to resolve the pay claim however this has been rejected by the union.”Robin McCormick, General Manager at SONI said: “We have been engaging with staff and representatives from the Prospect Union over several months in an attempt to reach a resolution to this matter, however, to date, we have been unable to reach a satisfactory outcome.“The company is continuing to engage with staff and their representatives through the offices of the Labour Relations Agency to resolve the matter.“In addition, the offer of Industrial Arbitration remains on the table, as we believe it to be the best route to a satisfactory outcome for our staff, the organisation and our customers throughout Northern Ireland.”UUP MLA Roy Beggs, asked about the potential impact of industrial action, said: “SONI is an essential piece of the Northern Ireland electricity infrastructure. Without SONI co-ordinating the dispatch of electricity from our power stations, we risk blackouts.“SONI staff have a high level of technical expertise and three-to-four years is an exceptionally long time to go without even an inflationary pay increase. I hope that Northern Ireland is not getting caught up in industrial disputes which are occurring in the Republic as a result of the Irish government’s stance on public sector pay.”try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian OgleIan Ogle funeral: He died protecting those he believed to be in danger, pastor tells mourners          ..

However, an amendment to the motion will also be debated which could instead see the party also build formal partnerships with Fine Gael and the Irish Labour Party.Former leader Alasdair McDonnell said it is not yet clear what the Fianna Fail link would mean.“However the shutdown of Stormont and Brexit on top of that has created a demand for something to break the stalemate,” he said.However, personally, he is “in favour of working with everybody in Dublin and Brussels”.Another former leader, Margaret Ritchie, said she was initially opposed to the link, but has changed her mind in light of Brexit and the lack of devolved government. She said there had been some opposition from elements of SDLP youth. “But among my wider coterie of colleagues people are generally supportive of the idea.”Newry delegate John McArdle believes the proposal will be supported by about two thirds of the delegates, although he does see a Belfast-rural split.“Belfast would be more centre left but it will probably not be enough to overcome the vote,” he said. He thinks there will eventually be a single All Ireland identity for one party. However former MLA Alban Maginnis wants a number of partners . “I feel that we have to relate to all the democratic parties in the south,” he said.Sam McBride: Overlooked concession by PM may lead to future Irish border dispute Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian OgleIan Ogle funeral: He died protecting those he believed to be in danger, pastor tells mourners          ..

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.
