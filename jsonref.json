This was around 2 or 3am.¬†\u0027They were putting their hands round each other a bit. It certainly seemed more than a bit of interaction with a fan who had come up to him.\u0027She was leaning into him and whispering stuff in his ear and he had his arms around her waist from behind at one point.\u0027They were together for more than an hour and danced a little bit although they didn\u0027t go on to the dance floor.\u0027          Rooney will return to England as player coach at Derby County in January.

The source added: \u0027They had fun but nothing inappropriate happened.\u0027In the early hours, the players went back to the team hotel, the 34-floor Hyatt Regency, where Rooney was seen with a male friend and the woman before the friend left and they headed towards the lift.An onlooker said: \u0027Wayne was laughing and joking with this girl, who was attractive and had tattoos on her arm. They waited a while and got into a lift together.

Rooney will wear number 32 as part of the deal, which will see him earn ¬£7.8million over 18 months.MPs and the Church of England were among those condemning the link up with the online bookmakers.

Washington and Beijing have ratcheted up the tariffs they impose on each other‚Äôs goods, while Donald Trump spooked markets last week by demanding that US companies repatriate their operations from China. Central banks around the world have come under pressure to ease monetary policy to provide more support as the global economy feels the strain of falling trade volumes and weaker investment by increasingly cautious businesses. Trump is demanding the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, as fears grow over an economic slowdown in the US.Britain recorded the first monthly trade surplus in more than eight years in June amid a plunge in imports, as UK companies eased back from stockpiling goods from abroad. British firms had rushed to buy goods from the EU and elsewhere in the lead-up to the original 29 March Brexit deadline, leading to an imports surge and pushing the UK trade deficit ‚Äì the gap between imports and exports ‚Äì to the highest levels on record. Now running down their supplies rather than placing new orders, imports have fallen. Over the three months to June, imports plunged by ¬£18bn. The UK goods and services trade balance was in surplus by ¬£1.8bn in June, after a deficit of ¬£2bn in May, beating the forecasts of City economists.Boris Johnson is on course to overshoot the government‚Äôs budget target by at least ¬£8bn this year after extra spending on the NHS and preparations for a no-deal Brexit cut the surplus in July. The public finances were down by ¬£2.2bn compared with July 2018 to leave a ¬£1.3bn surplus last month, worse than had been expected by City analysts. Alongside January, July is typically a surplus month because iniduals make their self-assessment returns in those months. However, the surplus was smaller than expected due to rises in central government spending, much of it on salaries, as Whitehall departments stepped up hiring to cope with Brexit. The weaker position in the public finances comes as Johnson pledges to raise spending across the board, on areas such as police, defence, the NHS and Brexit planning.Mounting fears of no-deal Brexit appear to have dragged down house prices across the country last month, as families showed an increasing reluctance to moving home amid the political turmoil. A gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ‚Äì which shows the difference between members reporting price rises and falls ‚Äì dropped to -9 in July from -1 in June, a steeper decline than had been forecast by City economists. According to official figures, house prices in the south of England are falling for the first time since 2009, amid a broader slowdown across the country since the Brexit vote.Supporters of Brexit argue that leaving the EU would enable the UK to strike new trade deals elsewhere around the world. However, conditions for global trade have deteriorated significantly in recent months as the US-China trade war rages. The escalation of the long-running dispute between Washington and Beijing has sunk factory output around the world and dragged down business investment, with companies reluctant to spend while the world‚Äôs two biggest economic superpowers impose tariffs on one another‚Äôs goods. According to surveys of global factory output compiled by IHS Markit, the tensions have tipped world manufacturing into recession territory. Economic growth has slowed in several countries, including in the US and the eurozone, as fears mount of a global recession. Economists warn that leaving the EU ‚Äì which is the world‚Äôs largest free trading bloc ‚Äì into an increasingly protectionist world could further damage the UK economy.

He impressed dignitaries at the G7 summit in Biarritz with a capacity for seriousness that used to come as standard in prime ministers. Johnson sets the bar low, then clears it. He steered a traditional British diplomatic course between Europe and the US. His style is a flattering tribute to Donald Trump but on the substance ‚Äì Russia, Iran, the climate emergency ‚Äì the UK still sides with Germany and France. That balancing act will be harder outside the EU, and the messier the Brexit, the wobblier the tightrope.Johnson needs a trade deal with Washington. It is the totem pole around which Tory Eurosceptics perform their frenzied anti-Brussels war dances. But Trump does not distinguish between commerce and state power. He will set the price of a deal at total loyalty in foreign affairs and surrender to US corporate interests. The UK must switch regulatory and strategic alignment from European to US standards, and thereby forfeit privileged access to the vast market on its doorstep. Few Brexiteers understand what that means in practice. The UK voice will be heard in Brussels from the wrong side of a closed door ‚Äì and in Washington from the end of a tight leash. That is what a hard Brexit looks like once the bombastic rhetoric is stripped away. Theresa May worried that the price was too high Johnson doesn‚Äôt care. This dramatic pivot in Britain‚Äôs global orientation is easily overlooked because the contrast in political style between the new prime minister and his predecessor is more conspicuous. May was ready to swallow the Northern Irish backstop because she was not horrified by the prospect of perpetual European alignment that it implied. For Johnson, ending that alignment is the whole point.Continental leaders perceive the shift better than many in Westminster. The debate in Britain is consumed by the question of whether a no-deal Brexit can be averted, which is understandable given the pain involved. MPs have poured energy into procedural innovation. Some dream of exotic coalitions, but a more feasible short-term fix, judging by the result of cross-party talks on Tuesday, is the erection of legislative crash barriers to stop the UK flying off a cliff on 31 October. That would be a remarkable achievement, considering the old tribal enmities that had to be overcome simply to convene a meeting in the Labour leader‚Äôs office. There is no doubt about the determination of opposition parties (and a handful of Tory rebels) to slay the no-deal dragon. The missing component is any suggestion of what UK-EU relations should look like if they succeed.In Brussels the orderliness of the transition also matters. With Johnson in Downing Street, no deal and a last-minute deal are correctly understood to be rocky and smooth roads to the same destination. The UK has finally chosen from the menu of possible future relationships that Michel Barnier depicted back in 2017 as a staircase descending from membership, via Norway and Switzerland to WTO terms.It is to be a Canadian-style free trade deal. Talks to get there can begin promptly, on friendly terms if the UK accepts some kind of backstop for Northern Ireland and pays the money it owes to the EU budget. Otherwise there will be a pointless, messy, bitter interlude followed by much tougher negotiations.Those are the options that Johnson has created for himself and either way the outcome is the same. The UK sets itself up as a vast tax haven and tries to poach investment away from its neighbours with low wages and lax regulators. Brussels, determined to avoid having such a piratical marketplace on its doorstep, demands ‚Äúlevel playing field‚Äù provisions in any trade deal. The UK resists. Talks are bogged down for years, during which British living standards stagnate or decline. It is not a good model but, with a bit of spin, it is a concept that most Tories can rally around and sell in an election: the classic Eurosceptic myth of buccaneering Albion, sailing to liberty on the open Atlantic after decades of captivity in a grotty Belgian harbour.What is the opposition‚Äôs alternative? Jeremy Corbyn positions himself as standard-bearer for resistance to a no-deal Brexit ‚Äì but that is a rearguard action, not a forward march. The Labour leader‚Äôs primary goal is power, to which end he needs the support of pro-European MPs and remain voters in the country. Fear of upsetting that constituency has brought him to reluctant endorsement of a second referendum, but not yet to any declaration of enthusiasm for the EU. If Corbyn has a strategic concept of Britain‚Äôs place in the world today, he is not sharing it. His sparse forays into the technical side of Brexit are marked by hostility to Brussels rules on state aid and competition. If he ever found himself trying to negotiate a deal with that as a red line, he would encounter the same level playing field problem that makes Johnson‚Äôs deregulation fantasy hard to enact in practice.Labour isions over Europe can be hard to discern in the melee of factional vendetta and bickering over tactics. Corbynism itself contains an ideological tension over the EU. There is a moderate view that values the European project as a historic expression of international solidarity, and a hardline tendency that sees Brussels rules as an impediment to socialist autarky. Labour remainers see the EU as a way for many states to regulate global markets with clout that lone nations cannot muster. Radical left Eurosceptics think the whole enterprise is infested with profiteering capitalism.Before he became leader, Corbyn‚Äôs instincts lay with the sceptics ‚Äì and there is no reason to think they have changed. In the middle are MPs who were pro-European once, but too afraid of their pro-Brexit constituents to make the case.Those cracks are papered with opposition to no deal. Being against the worst possible outcome allows the Labour leader to make hostile noises in the general direction of Brexit without opposing the thing itself. He raises his voice against Johnson‚Äôs way so no one can accuse him of complicity, but there is no Labour policy to save EU membership, nor any effort from the leader to argue that doing so might serve UK interests.The Tories like to denounce Corbyn as a remainer and Labour‚Äôs pro-Europeans wish he would be one ‚Äì so the opposition leader gets to hide in plain sight, as he has done since 2016. He talks around the subject without saying anything meaningful about it. He stands adjacent to the biggest strategic question facing the country for a generation without grabbing hold of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2257f290748139bf807967847b7f8313b78d6c38/263_0_5394_3237/master/5394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003afb5439c4176b23cc4e171760914c","title":"highschoolers phones yondr distraction","story":"Soon more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch that students lock their phones in during classPut your cellphone away. Stop texting. Stop using the camera as a mirror. Stop looking at Instagram. They‚Äôre the familiar commands of teachers and educators in the age of the smartphone.Most schools have put in place policies banning or regulating phone usage during school hours, and teachers now routinely find themselves confiscating devices or writing up students for being on their phones.Educators are now exploring more drastic measures. This school year, more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch system that allows students to lock away their phones while they‚Äôre in class. Each morning when students arrive at school, they magnetically lock their devices into their own personal green and gray pouches. They maintain possession of their pouches and devices, but they cannot unlock it until the end of the day, when they tap it on an unlocking magnet station located throughout the school.The concept is not new. Musicians and performers have been using Yondr to prevent people from filming their gigs since the San Francisco-based company launched in 2014. But in recent years, more and more schools have begun using the pouches to keep kids off their phones during school hours, with dozens in the Bay Area alone. ‚ÄúDemand has tripled this year,‚Äù the Yondr spokeswoman Kelly Taylor said.Allison Silvestri, the former principal of San Lorenzo high school east of San Francisco, implemented the tool three years ago. The results ‚Äúwere tremendous‚Äù, she said. The students were paying attention more in class. The school saw a decrease in referrals for defiance and disrespect. ‚ÄúIt was just so powerful to hear students interacting with each other and interacting with adults on campus,‚Äù she said.Edward Huang, 16, was part of a pilot program that tested Yondr at San Mateo high school before launching it this school year. He has mixed feelings about Yondr. He‚Äôs noticed a difference in his peers. ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt distracted,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven people who were on their phones in minor ways, like checking the time and checking notifications, those minor ways add up and have an effect on how engaged you are. Socially, it has improved us. Even if it‚Äôs all of us talking about how much we hate it, having something to hate is a conversation topic.‚ÄùBut he‚Äôs already heard about issues some kids have had because they couldn‚Äôt check their phones. Employers have tried to get in touch with students during the day, and couldn‚Äôt.Students have also figured out ways to hack the pouch. A few days ago, someone started an Instagram account that showcased ways to break the Yondr, said Audrey Morganstern, a 16-year-old junior at San Mateo high school. ‚ÄúThere was footage of them breaking the pin in the Yondr that controls the bag‚Äôs magnet‚Äù she said. Morganstern is a fan, however, likening Yondr to ‚Äútraining wheels for people that want to get off their phone‚Äù.‚ÄúThere are some people that I might not have been as close to that I‚Äôve had some pretty cool conversations with because before I might have had my phone as a crutch to avoid awkward situations,‚Äù she said. Leadership high school in San Francisco started using Yondr this year, but allow students the opportunity to unlock their pouches at lunchtime, said Beth Silbergeld, the school‚Äôs principal. She liked the concept of Yondr because the responsibility for the phones remained on the students. ‚ÄúWe are not in education to confiscate and manage property,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEven some schools that use a system that checks the phones into a box, it becomes a huge responsibility for the teachers.‚ÄùSome teachers have struggled to implement Yondr, just as some students have struggled to adhere by it and have found ways to hack the magnet lock, Silbergeld said.‚ÄúOur sophomores believe (this program) is because of them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey say, ‚ÄòWe were so bad so you did this.‚Äô But this was a decade of noticing that something wasn‚Äôt working and the efforts we were making of asking students to put their phones away and taking some of their phones away weren‚Äôt working.‚ÄùAt Berkeley high school, the freshman class is trying a Yondr pilot program this year, but the rest of the school is still operating as usual. School policy states that students cannot have their phones out during class, and Angela Coppola, who teaches 10th and 11th grade history, confiscated up to six phones a class last year.‚ÄúAdults struggle with the addictive nature of this technology, so you have to have compassion for children who have grown up with this technology,‚Äù she said. Coppola would support an effort to get students to go device free for the day. In her 11 years teaching, she said she‚Äôs seen the toll constant communication taken on her students. ‚ÄúIf you talk to any teacher, we‚Äôve all noticed in the past five years, we‚Äôve definitely seen a spike in anxiety,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúThe technology is so persuasive,‚Äù Coppola said. ‚ÄúHow can we expect people who are still developing to have stronger willpower than actual adults? We can‚Äôt.‚Äù"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f153a88aaf7448daa58f80a867b60548a5d437f3/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d6beccde0981ddb8932eb09e6ac7230","title":"share your thoughts on the proposed education measures","story":"Whether you are a teacher, school leader or work in education, we would like to hear from you A confidential briefing paper seen by the  reveals education measures including disciplinary changes to improve behaviour and increase pay for teachers.The document, marked ‚ÄúOfficial-Sensitive‚Äù, includes plans to increase teachers‚Äô basic pay to ¬£30,000 by 2022, open a new wave of free schools and encourage school leaders to confiscate or ban mobile phones, allowing teachers to use ‚Äúreasonable force‚Äù to curb bad behaviour.If you are a teacher, school leader or work in education we would like to know your thoughts on the proposals.What do you think of the proposed measures?

That meant she once wore it on a ferry. She has also worn it to walk the dog on the beach near her home in Suffolk. She has eaten fish and chips in it, cut the grass in it, flown to Dublin in it. It‚Äôs not just any old frock made by the bridal specialist Jenny Packham, there is no mistaking what it is. Strangely, she says, nobody ever says a word.O‚ÄôNolan is one of a number of women who refuse to consign their wedding dresses to the back of the wardrobe ‚Äì whether by repurposing them, recycling them or simply reusing them as they are. Some are building in flexibility ahead of the wedding, opting for outfits that will transition smoothly from aisle or register office to boardroom or holiday. After all, single-use dresses are bad for the environment and the bank balance, with the average British wedding dress last year costing nearly ¬£1,400.Anita Gera was one of those who answered our call for stories about reusing wedding clothes. She got married in Copenhagen in 2006, and has continued to wear the constituent parts of her outfit ‚Äì a tunic, trousers and dupatta (a long scarf) ‚Äì to parties, although the marriage is now over. On a recent mini-cruise with her mum to Hamburg, a gala night provided an opportunity to wear the whole ensemble. It helps that it is bright red. ‚ÄúI grew up in India,‚Äù she explains, ‚Äúso, to me, white is the colour of funerals and red is the colour you wear for joyous occasions.‚Äù While she wouldn‚Äôt wear her outfit in India, she felt comfortable on the cruise ship: ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs my wedding outfit but to most people it will just look like some glamorous Bollywood-style outfit.‚ÄùSophie Pollard also bought an outfit she could wear again. Having met her wife at primary school in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip, she married her in the local register office last year. She found the navy dress decorated with sunflowers for ¬£14 on the internet it has seen outings to the dental laboratory (where she makes false teeth), as well as to a friend‚Äôs wedding where she was ‚Äúbest man‚Äù ‚Äì she paired it with a black jacket to ‚Äújazz it up a bit‚Äù.Sanji, who married in 2017, has already reworn the lehenga (full ankle-length skirt) she wore then and plans to bring out her entire outfit later this month for a teej party, a traditional Nepali festival where women dress up, often in red.It can‚Äôt come too soon for the Dublin-based sustainability advocate Emma Gleeson. While much of the world is paring back in the name of the planet, she says, ‚Äúthe wedding thing seems to be getting more and more extreme‚Äù. For evidence, see the growing trend for multiple wedding outfits, as worn by the Duchess of Sussex and the singer Solange Knowles. For her own wedding, Gleeson settled on a white dress with a pattern on it. Not only did she want something she could wear again, but she disliked much of the culture surrounding wedding dresses. ‚ÄúI could see how bad my friends were made to feel by the shopping experience ‚Äì people saying: ‚ÄòOh well, you‚Äôll be a size smaller by the time you wear this‚Äô ‚Ä¶ horrible things like that.‚ÄùLesley Kazan-Pinfield was rejecting this kind of talk as long ago as 1980, when she wore a pair of homemade dungarees to get married at Truro register office. She continued to wear them until they fell apart.Other women find ways to recycle their dresses, beyond handing them down or selling them. It was only a week or two after her wedding in Burnley, 16 years ago, that Shaista got a call about a woman who lived in her mum‚Äôs old neighbourhood in Pakistan. Her husband had just died. ‚ÄúShe had three or four young children. In Pakistan, there‚Äôs no welfare state, so Mum rang me saying: ‚ÄòCan you contribute anything? I‚Äôm having a whip-round.‚Äô‚ÄùShaista decided to donate her wedding dress. When it made it to the woman, ‚ÄúShe just burst into tears ‚Äì she saw it as ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to be less reliant‚Äô‚Äù than if she had just been given some one-off money. The woman began charging people to borrow it for the day as Shaista describes it, it was ‚Äúa micro-business for her, a wedding dress for those who could never afford to buy‚Äù.There are a number of charities that use old gowns for new purposes. When Georgia Keogh-Horgan got married in 2013 in a secondhand dress from eBay, she thought that it might be something a future child would be able to wear. Tragically, her son died just hours after birth, but she found a charity called Cherished Gowns that turned wedding dresses into funeral gowns for babies. ‚ÄúI think my wedding dress has been made into 11 gowns and little nappies. Babies who are born very small don‚Äôt always have nappies that fit,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúWhen your baby dies, you still want to dress them normally ‚Ä¶ Little things like that are quite important.‚ÄùThe repurposing of wedding outfits fits in with today‚Äôs fashion for crafts ‚Äì sales of sewing machines have risen, and YouTube is now full of tutorials on how to knit hats and darn socks. But it has been going on for decades. When Lyn Armstrong got married in Sheffield in 1971, she didn‚Äôt have any preconceived notions of recycling her dress. Then, a few years later and six months pregnant, she needed an outfit for a dinner dance and didn‚Äôt want to buy something that she would probably never wear again. So she set to work turning her wedding dress into something inspired by Mary Quant. It seemed, she says, a ‚Äúvery appropriate fate for a wedding dress to become a maternity garment‚Äù.For her part, Mia Smith turned a section of her wedding dress into a stole when she was ordained as an Anglican priest in 2013, as well as fashioning others into christening gowns for her grandchildren. Ann Hill turned her wedding dress into a tennis outfit when money was short in the 1970s, while Angela Lorenz, a contemporary artist, cut her wedding dress up ‚Äúfor art‚Äù. Pieces of it are now in the British Library and other museums around the world.Rachael Falkner, who got married in Oxfordshire in 1990, discovered that her wedding dress was starting to yellow. So, a couple of years ago, after much pestering, she agreed to let her daughter use it as a corpse bride Halloween costume. ‚ÄúMy friends were shocked. One described it as like using 100-year-old wine for beef bourguignon.‚Äù But ‚Äúit made a great costume and we‚Äôve had a good laugh out of it‚Äù.And then there are reuses that deliver much-needed catharsis. Lucy Morgan‚Äôs white wedding dress stayed in the loft for a long time after her wedding in 2002. But the year she got orced and turned 50, she retrieved it and dyed it green. It was a meaningful move for her: ‚ÄúNew life, new growth,‚Äù she explains.Melanie Renn got married in the Appalachians in 1984. Twenty years into the marriage her husband left her. ‚ÄúI loved that dress and I‚Äôm sure I could have worn it again,‚Äù she says. Instead, she gave it to his new girlfriend, who was ‚Äúthrilled‚Äù. The decision was an impulse but Renn stands by it: ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt bear to look at it any more. Everything that reminded me of him had to go.‚Äù It was, she says, the ‚Äúbest repurpose ever‚Äù."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17329845cc2e3527b30ab21e14a540ebf3d381a3/0_0_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=387d8a6fdf887a5009d30688697488c0","title":"kim joys recipe for pistachio rose and cardamom tangzhong chelsea buns","story":"An Asian twist makes these buns extra-light and fluffyTangzhong, also known as water roux, is more commonly used for Asian breads.

Warm the butter until soft and spreadable.When the dough has risen, roll it out into a long rectangle (with the longest side facing you) on a lightly floured surface. Brush the surface with the butter, then sprinkle over the pistachio mixture. Roll up (from the longest side) into a tight scroll. Slice into 12 pieces using a sharp knife. Arrange on a baking tray (slightly separated, as they will spread and connect).Leave to rise for an hour or so until about doubled in size. About 15 minutes before they are ready to bake, heat the oven to 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6.When ready, brush with beaten egg, then bake for about 20 minutes until golden brown.Meanwhile, make the syrup. Put the sugar and water in a pan and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Then stir in the rose water.When the buns have finished baking, immediately brush them with rose syrup, sprinkle with rose petals and the leftover pistachio, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. If you like, you can add edible eyes to one or two, where the pistachio filling looks like a mouth.Baking with Kim-Joy: Cute and Creative Bakes to Make You Smile is published by Quadrille.

The Armenia midfielder pulled out after deciding it was too risky to travel to Azerbaijan amid the conflict between the countries over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.With the draw for the Champions League group stage to take place in Monaco on Thursday and the one for the Europa League on Friday, the Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham supporters‚Äô trusts and the Liverpool fan group Spirit of Shankly have urged Uefa to place the needs of supporters over sponsors.The groups said football would be nothing without fans and demanded Uefa stage finals in cities with good transport links and stadiums with large capacities, plus suitable accessibility for supporters with disabilities. Large numbers of disabled supporters of Arsenal and Chelsea chose not to travel to Baku.The groups said in a statement: ‚ÄúReaching a Champions League or Europa League final should be a wonderful experience for a club‚Äôs supporters. Instead, they can face a struggle just to attend the match. Problems range from inadequate numbers of tickets being awarded to the finalists through to all-but-impossible travel arrangements. Too often fans who had supported their clubs in every round up to the final were left out of pocket or not able to attend the final at all.‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äôs much hyped draw will involve everybody from the football family except the very people without whom there would be no European football ‚Äì its supporters. We call on Uefa to strengthen its dialogue with fans and request they start by engaging with groups like ourselves to discuss the proposals we have put forward.‚Äù"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bc5d0d6a4c45dfd9567c606c50489e15e31d208/0_280_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=773703d054debfff5a7eeeadfa9cba88","title":"champions league format european super league uefa","story":"Everybody has their favoured format for Uefa‚Äôs tournament but few want to see it evolve into a European Super League‚ÄúEurope,‚Äù Sir Alex Ferguson said, actually a little before Manchester United‚Äôs 1999 success in the Champions League helped bring a knighthood his way, ‚Äúought to be the cherry on the cake. No one wants it to be the whole cake ‚Äì that would spoil everything.‚ÄùFerguson was responding, a couple of decades ago, not only to non-champions being allowed into the hallowed event ‚Äì he would mellow on seeing United go all the way in Europe after finishing second behind Arsenal in 1998 ‚Äì but to Uefa tweaking the format once again to introduce a double group stage involving more matches. In the event that modification proved short-lived, lasting only until 2002-03, though there are still influential voices, the former United CEO David Gill among them, who consider a second mini-league a more attractive and competitive prospect than the present last 16, where group winners usually find it easy to reach the last eight.Everyone has their favourite version of the competition that started out as the European Cup. Some stubbornly believe it was better when restricted to national champions only, ignoring the huge financial gains and not inconsiderable drama that has played out over the last 20 years or so. Others feel it is just about perfect at the moment, with the right balance struck between commitments at home and in Europe, and from an English point of view the seeding for Thursday‚Äôs group stage draw appears to bear that out. Three Premier League teams take their place in pot one, with Liverpool and Chelsea joining Manchester City by virtue of the Uefa trophies claimed last season.With four English sides contesting the two European finals, and Spurs in with Real Madrid in pot two as a result, last season could hardly have gone any better for Premier League clubs, despite providing the only title race in Europe‚Äôs top leagues worthy of the name. These things can be transitory ‚Äì it is only three years ago that England‚Äôs sole representatives in the Champions League last eight were Leicester City ‚Äì but for now the best of both worlds can be enjoyed. England boasts a glamorous, competitive and above all lucrative league competition, with leading clubs using their wealth to make significant strides in Europe.While that might be a source of frustration for supporters of Bolton and Bury, it has not gone unnoticed in Europe either, with downtrodden fans unsurprised to hear that moves have been afoot to ringfence bigger clubs‚Äô revenues at the expense of smaller ones. Because the change to the Champions League format for 1991-92 was basically a response to the threat of a breakaway by big names across Europe, Uefa has found itself across a similar barrel at regular intervals since. The problem now is that too much of the money is in England and too little interest resides in the lop-sided leagues around Europe, dominated to an unhealthy extent by powerhouses such as Bayern Munich and Juventus. It is no accident that the strident European Club Association wishing to reconfigure the Champions League to provide twice as many matches is led by Andrea Agnelli of Juventus, and the logic behind his proposals for groups of eight teams rather than four, and automatic requalification for established Champions League clubs whatever their domestic league placing, is depressingly simple to spot. A Champions League thus configured would be a European Super League just waiting for the name.Fortunately, in the face of evidence that no one actually wants this apart from the handful of powerful sides who appear to have Uefa‚Äôs ear, talks between the ECA and Uefa‚Äôs president, Aleksander Ceferin, have just been put on hold. Nothing was going to change before 2024 anyway, but now there will be a pause for a rethink. Not everyone agrees with Ferguson that European football should be the cherry or the cake ‚Äì some would like it to be the bread and butter ‚Äì though it is not easy to see how that can happen without hardship and wastage among the majority of clubs left behind.It is difficult to make the case for the status quo without sounding like a nationalist or an anti-progressive, though it is debatable whether making a couple of dozen clubs infinitely richer than they are already really counts as progress. If the acting Bundesliga president, Reinhard Rauball, can speak out against the ECA initiative, when as president of Dortmund he must be as tired as everyone else of Bayern‚Äôs supremacy, he deserves hearing. ‚ÄúThe Bundesliga has the highest attendance figures in Europe, more than 42,000 on average, and we don‚Äôt want to destroy it with one decision,‚Äù Rauball said. ‚ÄúWe have to make it clear that the national league is the most important.‚ÄùIn parochial terms, Liverpool would never have been able to give City such a run for their money last season had they been obliged to play a 14-game group stage, although the eventual champions would have been operating under the same handicap. The quality of Premier League competition could only suffer, and an emerging team such as Tottenham would have found it much tougher to last the pace. Then again, what the ECA is saying to the big teams is that you don‚Äôt have to keep flogging yourself domestically, you can be in the Champions League every year.Yet think of Liverpool and their six European titles, four of them as English champions, the other two won in spite of uncertainty and effort in the Premier League. Would anyone on Merseyside really want a cessation of hostilities on the home front, or, perhaps worse, the next European prize to arrive with an asterisk?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/565aa442deccd410dd268645bebb3d7fa3a6b095/0_613_5528_3317/master/5528.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f60034cb4125159e4efa4fb84732b67","title":"bury expelled from efl after 125 years updates and reaction live","story":"Video: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been grown men ... 50-year-old men, 60-year-old men here crying.

Andy Holt tweets: The chairman and major shareholder of Accrington Stanley, Andy Holt is one of the good guys when it comes to club ownership and his club is lucky to have him in charge, when so many others are owned by spivs, hucksters and charlatans. This informative thread he posted on Twitter is well worth a couple of minutes of your time.What with the expulsion of Bury from the Football League being such an emotive issue, we‚Äôve been unable to open the comments on this live blog today. Social media suggests that football fans around the world have plenty to say on the matter, much of it extremely heartfelt and ‚Äì sadly ‚Äì potentially libellous.However, we would like to hear from you, so feel free to ping me a tweet or email, or share your reaction to Bury‚Äôs collapse and explain what it means to you in the bespoke form below. Thanks! More fans are gathering, sheltering from the rain beside turnstiles which only 24 hours ago showed ticket prices for Saturday‚Äôs now-abandoned game against Doncaster Rovers. Some fans are huddled under umbrellas, checking their phones for the latest news others are just here because it feels like the right place to be today.Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council, said his local authority was ready to support the club any way it can to ensure its survival, starting with reassuring fans about the future of its stadium, a fixture here since 1884.He said: ‚ÄúI want to be absolutely clear that if anyone thinks there will be any development on that site any time soon then they are totally misguided - planning law doesn‚Äôt allow it, the fact that it‚Äôs an asset of community value also means there are restrictions governing it.‚ÄùHe wouldn‚Äôt be drawn on whether the council would chip in to help buy the club if supporters formed a Community Interest Company (like at Darlington FC in 2013) but he pointed out that the authority was also in financial difficulty, having suffered massive budget cuts since 2010.Asked whether a fan-owned club looked was the most likely way forward for Bury FC, Tariq said: ‚ÄúSomething needs to change. The immediate thing that need to happen is Mr Dale needs to depart from the club, he needs to give up all of his links and he needs to decide how quickly he‚Äôs going to do that and allow - whether it‚Äôs the fans or another buyer - other people to lead the ship.It‚Äôs a sorry state of affairs that he‚Äôs allowed this situation to develop because he entered negotiations with C\u0026ampN at a very late stage. Had he been open to dialogue at an earlier stage maybe the outcome last night would have been different.‚ÄùConclusion: Going by what Jevans says, it seems that unless their hand is forced, the EFL will do precisely nothing to get their house in something approaching order in the wake of Bury‚Äôs expulsion.More than half of the 71 remaining league clubs outside the Premier League are living beyond their means and with the turkeys who run many of them extremely unlikely to vote for Christmas, what happened to Bury will inevitably happen to other clubs. Lots of other clubs.More from David Conn: ‚ÄúThere is no commitment to independent regulation, nor to any form of investigation into the details of what has happened at Bury,‚Äù he says, following his chat with Jevans.‚ÄúShe says they will receive information from C \u0026amp N Sporting Risk who did due diligence, and then consider any further action or investigation. The EFL is conducting a governance review, which will examine the ‚Äòfit and proper persons‚Äô owners and directors test and the financial regulations she declined to make any suggestions herself for reforms it should consider.‚Äù David Conn tweets. He‚Äôs been talking to Debbie Jevans and the Football League‚Äôs executive chair says she‚Äôs ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù by the her organisation‚Äôs decision to expel Bury from the Football League. But no so devastated that she‚Äôs prepared to do anything to stop it happening other clubs beyond making vague noises about asking them to control their costs. Good luck with that, Debbie!A tweet from Ivan Lewis: The Independent MP for Bury South remains convinced that Bury can and should still be saved from expulsion from the Football League.Josh Halliday, the ‚Äôs North of England correspondent who steered me in the direction of the Tweet, says he has spoken to Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council, who demanded that owner Steve Dale relinquish control of the club and urged the EFL to rethink its decision.‚ÄúMany fans have expressed concerns that Gigg Lane, Bury‚Äôs home since 1885, could be sold off and turned into flats given the club‚Äôs collapse,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúBut Tariq guaranteed that the council would not let that happen. There are planning laws in place, he said, to protect Gigg Lane as a sporting ground and Bury FC as a community institution.‚Äù A Bury FC player speaks. Speaking to Talksport earlier this morning, Bury‚Äôs 33-year-old midfielder Stephen Dawson seemed resigned to having to sell his house.‚ÄúI‚Äôve been onto the mortgage adviser this morning because that is the end,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no two ways about it now, that is it for me.‚ÄúI‚Äôve played my whole career and put everything into my house and my kids to give them a start in life when they are 18, whether that be a deposit for a house or money for college.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the fancy cars or the fancy clothes as I was never in a position to earn the thousands and thousands the really good players earn.‚Äù The week before last, Dawson and Bury owner Steve Dale had a frank and bad-tempered exchange of views on the radio station, in which Dale openly rubbished the notion that Dawson might have to sell his home to make ends meet. Horse bolts, MP wants to know why stable door was left open: Damian Collins has called for a full review of the English Football League‚Äôs role in Bury‚Äôs demise.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, claimed the EFL has let Bury‚Äôs fans down after expelling the club from its competition and said new laws were needed to safeguard other clubs from potential rogue owners.‚ÄúThe process run by @efl has failed fans of @buryfcofficial \u0026amp may do the same to @OfficialBWFC,‚Äù the MP for Folkestone and Hythe, tweeted. ‚ÄúNext week CommonsCMS will discuss how we can review the role of the football authorities in this crisis \u0026amp what new powers are needed to act against bad owners and directors of clubs.‚Äù Greetings, one and all. The broadcaster Jim White shipped a lot of abuse on social media yesterday for standing in front of a Sky Sports News graphic of a countdown clock, as he reported on the goings-on at Bury and Bolton. Assorted viewers accused him and the network that employs him of appearing to revel in Bury‚Äôs demise in the tackiest manner imaginable.Well, this morning on his Talksport show, Jim addressed the issue. He said that while he appreciated that people might have found the graphic tacky, he has no control over behind-the-scenes production at Sky. He also went on to address the crusading he has done on behalf of Bury and Bolton fans on Talksport in recent weeks, ‚Äúbecause that‚Äôs what we do‚Äù. ‚ÄúAnd for some reason they talk to us and that‚Äôs what I want. The important thing today is Bolton and Bury, not some ticking clock.‚Äù Jim finished up by having a right go at somebody on Twitter posting under a made-up name who claimed he was revelling in Bury‚Äôs demise. Full disclosure: I know Jim, albeit barely. I am also a colleague of his at Talksport, although I have only ever done one show with him.While I suspect a man of his status might have more clout than he is letting on when it comes to the behind-the-scenes goings-on at Sky Sports News when it comes to shows he is presenting, I genuinely can‚Äôt think of any other national broadcaster who has done more in recent weeks to highlight the peril in which Bury and Bolton find themselves. The people criticising him for apparently ‚Äúrevelling‚Äù in Bury‚Äôs demise seem strangely reluctant to acknowledge those efforts. Time for me to hand over to Barry Glendenning. He‚Äôll keep you updated on events in Bury for the rest of the day.‚ÄúI shed tears this morning when I read about Bury FC‚Äôs demise,‚Äù John Harker says. ‚ÄúThat surprised me. Why I asked myself as a Sheffield United supporter celebrating life in the Premier League, should I care about a lower league club I have no connection to, do not support and never will.‚ÄúThe answer is I think because I love the game, its history and traditions. I am connected to Bury and to Bolton Wanderers as is everyone who loves the game in this country whether we know it or not. No man is an island, just as no football club is an island. There but for the grace of God go we. Every football supporter knows that in hisher heart of hearts. They know it even more this morning.‚ÄúThe only crumb of comfort I can offer those loyal supporters is that this isn‚Äôt necessarily the end. Look at Accrington Stanley just up the road. It took time but it can be done. The best of luck to you.‚ÄùNeil Danns, the Bury FC captain who helped win the club promotion last season, said the club‚Äôs collapse had ‚Äúdamaged many, many lives‚Äù and called for ‚Äúthe powers that be‚Äù to be held accountable.He told BBC Radio Manchester: ‚ÄúDevastated is an understatement. You see some of the staff members that have been working thee for years in turmoil and wondering what‚Äôs going to happen. It‚Äôs been something I wouldn‚Äôt wish on any fan or player.‚ÄùDanns said owner Steve Dale had contacted him earlier this summer and assured him that ‚Äúeverything was going to be okay‚Äù despite mounting questions over the club‚Äôs finances. He said questions now need to be asked of Dale, the previous owner Stewart Day, and the EFL.He added: ‚ÄúPeople have got to stand up and be accountable because it‚Äôs damaged many, many lives. You see people crying outside the ground, young fans waking up this morning with no football team, and that‚Äôs a sad, sad situation in this day and age ... There‚Äôs definite questions that have to be asked, not just of the owner and previous owners but also the powers that be.‚ÄùChair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee and MP for Folkestone and Hythe Damian Collins has said the role of the football authorities and any possible changes to power will be reviewed in the House of Commons next week. EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans admitted rescheduling five postponed matches became a major factor in reaching the decision to expel Bury from the Football League. This is an action that was taken, that was done with much regret and I‚Äôm feeling devastated to be here talking to you. We simply ran out of time, having already postponed five matches, it would have been six matches. We were struggling to fit that in and it was with deep regret that we just couldn‚Äôt go on anymore. We went into everything that was sent to us with detail, trying to do everything that we could to save the club.‚ÄùJevans admitted that the EFL ‚Äúneeds to learn some lessons‚Äù and she believes lower league clubs should consider the option of a salary cap. We need to sit back, we need to look back, we need to learn some lessons. I‚Äôm speaking personally, I‚Äôm speaking for myself here. I think absolutely we need to look at the spend of clubs as much as the revenues, and looking at salary caps is absolutely something that I think the clubs should consider.‚ÄùBolton have confirmed that ‚Äúany plans that may have been made for the immediate closure of the club have been put on hold‚Äù by the administrator.A petition calling for the creation of an independent regulator for football has almost 6000 signatures.Former Wigan chairman David Sharpe has offered his sympathy to Bury.An email. ‚ÄúA very sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the town,‚Äù David Roberts says. ‚ÄúAs a lifelong Hereford United fan I know what you are going through and the anger and frustration. There is however light at the end of the tunnel‚Ä¶..we rose from the ashes as a phoenix club, Hereford FC, and started over again. A long road back but one to look forward to. Keep the faith!!!!!!!!‚ÄùThe Bolton Wanderers Supporters Trust has sent its ‚Äúheartfelt sympathy‚Äù to Bury fans and offered any help it can this morning. The mutual support shown by fans of both financially-stricken clubs, north-west rivals who were due to play each other a week on Saturday, has been brilliant to see.This is without doubt a sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the local community. We appreciate how hard this decision has been for all parties involved.Following on from their expulsion from the English Football League, Bury FC will no longer be able to participate in the Emirates FA Cup for the 201920 season. We are therefore now consulting with our stakeholders regarding the first round proper following their exit from the league.If the club re-forms we look forward to them applying to make an application to The Football Association to re-join league competition further down the English football pyramid from the 202021 season.Sports minister Nigel Adams has said the EFL must look into the circumstances surrounding Bury‚Äôs plight.This is a very dark day for English football. It is a tragedy for the fans of Bury, the local community and everyone connected with the historic club. There will be a huge amount of anger and disbelief about how this happened. I have been in regular contact with the EFL and it is right that they closely review the processes at Bury to see if any lessons can be learned. The club‚Äôs passionate fans don‚Äôt deserve to go through this. I hope once the dust has settled they can begin to rebuild and take inspiration from other clubs that have done so before them.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs a strongly worded thread on Twitter from Accrington Stanley owner Andy Holt.The PFA have released a statement on Bury‚Äôs expulsion from the Football League.It is with great sadness to hear that Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after a takeover bid from C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk collapsed.We have been in regular communication with the players, the EFL and the club over the last eight months to try and protect our members and secure a long-term future for Bury FC.Unfortunately, despite our efforts to support the process, the club has been unable to fulfill its financial commitments or complete a possible take-over deal.This will be a desperately sad time for Bury‚Äôs players and staff.We will continue to support all our members who have been impacted by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts.Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and the wider community who will be devastated by this news.Our reporter David Conn wrote a damning piece on the Bury debacle yesterday.After such grinding and unnecessary failures precipitating expulsion from the Football League for Bury, a 134-year-old club founded by late Victorian civic-minded chaps in 1885, there have to be inquiries, lessons learned and reforms. The English Football League has promised to upgrade its rules to prevent such an implosion ever happening again. The Labour MP for Bury North, James Frith, who has worked relentlessly to expose ugly truths and to help save the club, has called for investigations and parliamentary scrutiny.The two modern, analytical young football men, Rory Campbell and Henry Newman, who decided not to proceed with their deadline-day proposed purchase, made clear in their statement that stronger governance is needed and the Bury wreckage was the result of ‚Äúsystemic failings ... over a number of years‚Äù.The FA have announced that Bury will not be involved in this season‚Äôs FA Cup. They would have entered the first round in November.If you‚Äôre a Bury fan, what do you do without football on a Saturday? This could happen to fans of any lower league club, you know. A football club plays such a crucial role in a local community and means so much to so many people. It‚Äôs part of their lives. You never think it won‚Äôt be there. What do you do without it?In other grim news Bolton Wanderers could yet go the same way as Bury. They have been given 14 days to find a buyer.Bury captain Neil Danns delivered a strong message to owner Steve Dale yesterday.‚ÄúI would say look what you‚Äôve done. This should never have happened. If you thought you could not move this club forward in a positive way you should never have taken over because you‚Äôve literally destroyed lives, because that‚Äôs what this football club meant to so many fans. When you see the devastation of the fans I just think I have to say something. It‚Äôs unbelievable. I still can‚Äôt believe it. We have been in as normal, training. I don‚Äôt think anyone really believed that this was going to happen. We were just preparing every single week as though the next game was going to be on, the next game was going to be on. For it to happen so suddenly, it‚Äôs still really unbelievable. For a club with so much history and that has added so much to the league, for it to just be gone like that is just unimaginable.‚ÄùDanns was captain of the side that won promotion from League Two last season. I‚Äôve come to have a special bond with the fans and created some amazing memories, especially last year. At this moment in time I just feel for them the most because you have got people who have been going to the game for years. It‚Äôs like every story, you go to the game with your Grandad, your Mum, your Dad, your brothers, it‚Äôs such a community. It means so much to people. For me, it‚Äôs starting to hit me harder because I have got young sons myself. I know what it is like to take them to watch my boyhood team Liverpool and the bond that gives us. To see that taken away from future fans is just devastating. Football brings not just football on the pitch but it is so much more than that. This whole situation just does not feel real.‚ÄùDave Giffard, the chair of Forever Bury Supporters Club, says that fans are discussing their next move. We have got a meeting this morning to look at our next move. What we would like to do is try and save this football club. If we have to restart as a phoenix club we would like to get hold of this ground. We have the support of the council.‚ÄùHello. This is a dark day for English football. Bury have been expelled from the Football League after 125 years of membership after after the EFL board finally ran out of patience with its financial collapse and owner, Steve Dale. The deadline for the club to find a new owner passed on Tuesday afternoon, with a proposed sale to C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk collapsing earlier in the day. Shame on Dale, shame on the EFL, shame on the Football Association. We‚Äôll have rolling reaction here today as Bury supporters reel from the shock of their club‚Äôs expulsion from the league."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7356f79bcf35b9e9a6d565f50b1f7e8c02372df3/0_1014_4976_2986/master/4976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeca33f632beb08a3ed054fc14437c7c","title":"ethiopians yemen saudi arabia in pictures","story":"Escaping poverty and drought, Ethiopians are making the dangerous sea crossing from Djibouti to Yemen and then on foot to the Saudi border.

The standard L-shaped dormer came under permitted development rights which do not require planning permission. But when the work began we applied for an optional certificate of lawfulness from Lambeth council. It didn‚Äôt review our application until September when it was rejected. It turned out that the planning department had unilaterally reinterpreted the rules in August 2018 without notifying residents, builders or architects. L-shaped dormers are now no longer considered a permitted development, although they are in other London boroughs. Six weeks later, we were served an enforcement notice. The government‚Äôs guidance states that certificates of lawfulness are optional and many builders don‚Äôt bother to apply. This means there may now be hundreds of ‚Äúillegal‚Äù lofts in Lambeth. If a council can change the rules overnight without notification, it creates a trap for builders and, by interpreting the rules differently, defeats the purpose of permitted development legislation. Permitted development rules were intended to free small projects from red tape.

However, Lambeth seemed intent on applying its new rules retrospectively, saying: ‚ÄúThe council‚Äôs approach has been dictated by appeal decisions since the summer of 2018, which have shown government planning inspectors have, in the main, not been recognising most L-shaped dormers as falling within permitted development. The council is mindful that some of the proposals recently refused will likely be appealed and is awaiting the outcome as a guide to dealing with such proposals going forward.‚ÄùThe Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government merely says: ‚ÄúInterpretation of permitted rights is a matter for the local planning authority in the first instance. An applicant can appeal where it considers the authority has not interpreted the rights correctly.‚ÄùYou have since done so and won, but it has left you ¬£5,000 out of pocket. The court refused to award you costs because it decided it was reasonable for the council to review its approach following a series of appeal decisions.Your experience suggests the law is a shambles.

Parliament is expected to sit for little more than a week from 3 September.But asked if he was denying opposition MPs the time to stop a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told Sky News: ‚ÄúNo, that is completely untrue. We are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, hospitals, making sure we have the education funding we need.‚ÄùIn the letter to colleagues, Johnson said MPs would be able to debate his approach to the EU negotiations before the European council on 17 October, at which any new deal would have to be agreed by the EU27 ‚Äì and to vote on it afterwards.‚ÄúParliament will have the opportunity to debate the government‚Äôs overall programme, and approach to Brexit, in the run-up to EU Council, and then vote on this on 21 and 22 October, once we know the outcome of the council.‚ÄúShould I succeed in agreeing a deal with the EU, parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the bill required for ratification of the deal ahead of 31 October,‚Äù he said. Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that Johnson had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already expected to break briefly for party conferences.Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen‚Äôs behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen‚Äôs speech at the formal state opening of parliament.On Wednesday morning, the Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, confirmed the move on Twitter, saying that planning to hold a Queen‚Äôs speech was something that ‚Äúall new governments do‚Äù.Labour‚Äôs deputy leader, Tom Watson, called the move ‚Äúan utterly scandalous affront to our democracy. We cannot let this happen.‚ÄùA meeting of opposition MPs, convened by Jeremy Corbyn, agreed on Tuesday to let legislative efforts take priority over a confidence vote in the new government as a mechanism to stop no deal ‚Äì a priority that could be changed given the curtailing of the parliamentary timetable.The proposed new timetable would leave MPs with a far narrower window to pass anti-no deal legislation, cutting it short by two weeks, with new dates likely to be:The UK would be due to leave the EU on 31 October.Rumours swirled in Westminster on Tuesday that plans were afoot to stymie MPs‚Äô efforts to stop no deal after it was revealed that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, would hold a fast-tracked spending review on the day after MPs return to parliament next week, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing..The swift timing of the review came as the first major speech by the chancellor was abruptly cancelled by the Treasury with less than 24 hours‚Äô notice.A Treasury spokesman said the speech had been cancelled because the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been expected to take place later this autumn, was being fast-tracked.Javid, writing in the Daily , suggested he would not break his predecessor Philip Hammond‚Äôs strict fiscal rules, saying the government could ‚Äúafford to spend more on the people‚Äôs priorities ‚Äì without breaking the rules around what the government should spend ‚Äì and we‚Äôll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police.‚ÄùThe chancellor said his economic priorities were health, education and policing, suggesting that other key areas including housing may get overlooked for major investment.He said: ‚ÄúHealth and education aren‚Äôt just the names of departments ‚Äì they‚Äôre lifelines of opportunity, just as they were for me. The teachers who persuaded me that I had what it takes to study economics, and put me on the path to becoming chancellor of the exchequer.‚ÄúThe police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up on became a centre for drug dealers. The NHS that cared for my dad in his final days. These aren‚Äôt just numbers on a spreadsheet. They‚Äôre the beating heart of our country.‚ÄùThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ‚ÄúNobody is fooled into believing that this is a proper and normal spending review. It‚Äôs a one off pre-election panic-driven stunt budget.Whitehall sources suggested there was considerable concern MPs could trigger a vote of no confidence in the government and an early general election, which could lead to departments being left in the dark about spending plans, with budgets running out in 2020.‚ÄúWe want people to be able to plan and there is a reason it is in early September because of the risks when MPs return to the house that week,‚Äù one source said.The 12-month review, instead of the usual three-year review, is intended as a short-term measure to give departments new budgets and also free up officials to focus on preparing for Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94f72fed50880612f14c40bf3c6c010c3f03219d/950_523_963_578/master/963.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e67e6701d13e88d49e36257f8b426ee","title":"eu condemns sinister move to suspend uk parliament","story":"Guy Verhofstadt says five-week suspension unlikely to deliver stable future relationshipEuropean sources have warned that Boris Johnson‚Äôs move to suspend parliament for five weeks has increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit, while a leading MEP said: ‚ÄúTaking back control has never looked so sinister.‚ÄùThe plan to suspend parliament for five weeks, which would drastically reduce MPs‚Äô ability to influence changes to the withdrawal agreement or seek a delay, is seen in Brussels as a move to overpower rebels and force through Johnson‚Äôs Brexit agenda.The European parliament‚Äôs coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said the move was unlikely to deliver a stable future relationship. ‚Äú‚ÄòTaking back control‚Äô has never looked so sinister,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs a fellow parliamentarian, my solidarity with those fighting for their voices to be heard.

It has also been pointed out that it does buy Johnson more time to strike a deal, if there are fewer parliamentary sessions.EU diplomats remain sceptical about whether the prime minister can find alternatives to the Irish backstop ‚Äì the main stumbling block ‚Äì that can win over his party.Frost was not expected to put fresh ideas on the table, while the EU is stressing that proposals need to be offered sooner rather than later. ‚ÄúI am not aware of any 30 days deadline,‚Äù an European commission spokesperson said, when asked about Johnson‚Äôs declaration that such a ‚Äúblistering timetable‚Äù existed. ‚ÄúOf course, for us, the earlier the better, because our working assumption is that Brexit should occur on 31 October and that should happen with a deal and that is our preferred scenario and the scenario we are working to. So for that to happen, the earlier we see workable proposals, the better.‚ÄùThe spokesperson said Juncker and Johnson had agreed to ‚Äúcontinue the dialogue‚Äù during a phone call between the two leaders on Tuesday evening.The EU has maintained its readiness to replace the backstop, an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Under the backstop, agreed between the EU and Theresa May, Northern Ireland would continue to follow many EU single market rules, while the UK would remain part of an EU single customs territory.The backstop would kick in automatically if the two sides failed to find an alternative and would apply until new arrangements could be agreed.Dublin remains sceptical about alternatives that have been circulating.‚ÄúI think we need to be honest here that the alternative arrangements that have been discussed to date do not do the same job as the backstop, not even close,‚Äù said Ireland‚Äôs deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, speaking after a meeting with his Czech counterpart on Tuesday evening. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs not pretend that solutions exist when they might not.‚ÄùIn his call with Johnson, Juncker said the EU‚Äôs support for Ireland was ‚Äústeadfast‚Äù and that the bloc would ‚Äúcontinue to be very attentive to Ireland‚Äôs interests‚Äù.The UK government has said it is ‚Äúworking at pace to find a wide range of flexible and creative solutions to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland‚Äù."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/898a42083b5767a31f7737ba3d081f0828c72eaf/0_16_3144_1886/master/3144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53f526221137ccc5e177a020b4def19e","title":"parliament only has itself to blame readers on plans to suspend parliament","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to government plans to suspend parliament in the second week of SeptemberI‚Äôm sorry but parliament only has itself to blame for where we find ourselves. Parliament legislated for a two year period to negotiate a deal with no deal being the default option. They literally made this law. Parliament then proceeded to vote down multiple times the deal that was put to it despite the EU insisting that it was the only and best deal available and despite the WA being required for whatever type of Brexit transpired, even if ultimately staying in the single market. And they voted it down for their own contrived reasons, and ulterior motives. So once again, it is the members of parliament collectively responsible for where we are today. OhnoessNow‚Äôs the time to stop all tribal warfare ‚Äì serious times takes a strong coalition to fight this outrage. All parties came together during the second world war, to fight a foreign enemy, we have an internal enemy who has similar thoughts, to destroy the population and its way of life. So everybody should begin by contacting their MP and tell himher that if you support this situation, you have lost my vote. notgotaclueI cannot believe that this is the state of play in a country that was known around the world as a great proponent of democracy. If this goes ahead, by hook or by crook, it gives further credence to (re)forming the constitution and getting rid of the monarchy. Absolute shambles from a cockwomble extraordinaire. Well done, UK. Well done. awaw1283Brexiters, with their alleged love of tradition, might want to reflect on the awful position this is putting the Queen in. I‚Äôm personally agnostic on the royals, I don‚Äôt think they have any significant role in our governance, and they probably attract tourists, so fine I don‚Äôt have problem with them. However, if the Queen was drafted in to support this coup, that would be a different story. OldSynnerWhat an absolute travesty. If a government can‚Äôt get parliament to support it the correct route is a general election. The precedent this would set is abominable. GavinlBellIf Elizabeth Windsor has any sense, she‚Äôll realise that the game is up. Sitting on her hands is no longer a viable option. It‚Äôs quite obvious that during the latter part of her reign, Britain has gone from being an out-of-date democracy, to a completely broken one. Clearly it doesn‚Äôt help that it also has a broken government, and a broken opposition, but contagion spreads. That might not be entirely her fault ‚Äì the media and our politicians have clearly played a significant part ‚Äì but unless she steps in and prevents Johnson‚Äôs destruction of British democracy, she‚Äôs going to go down in the history books as the monarch who failed the country. Time for a written constitution, and for the entire political system to be overhauled. BlueThirdWhat this government is doing is an anti-democratic coup, pure and simple. If the scarcely believable reports this morning are accurate, it will show (i) the weaknesses wrought by lack of a written constitution, and (ii) further evidence (if any were needed) of the utter uselessness of the monarch as any kind of democratic safeguard. Anyone who wondered what defences this country had against an authoritarian executive has their answer. There needs to be legislation andor a vote of no confidence in the week beginning 3 September. And MPs like Rory Stewart, Gubb, Lee, Letwin and Grieve need to put their money where their mouths are. This is democracy at stake. hendchard11Unbelievable is all I can say. The UK is going down the same road as America where one half of the country hates the other half. If this goes ahead and parliament is shut down, it will surely rank amongst one of the worst abuses of power in any modern democracy. You can absolutely kiss the union goodbye with this and the further result of this will be a humbled England that is a vassal state of America.

It floated the possibility that a parliamentary crisis could become a royal crisis.Republic‚Äôs spokesman, Graham Smith, said Johnson had thrown British politics into a deep crisis ‚Äúand has shone a spotlight on the impotence of the Queen and the role of the monarch‚Äôs powers‚Äù.‚ÄúAlready people are petitioning the Queen to intervene, but she won‚Äôt. Not because she can‚Äôt, but because the Queen‚Äôs first priority is always the preservation of the monarchy.‚ÄúBut Johnson‚Äôs decision to prorogue parliament has created a unique crisis for the Queen. The convention is that the Queen does as she‚Äôs told by the PM. But in normal times the PM has the full support of a majority in the Commons.‚Äù‚ÄúConstitutionally the Queen is free to decide whether or not to go along with the government‚Äôs plans or support the sovereign parliament. So the Queen has a choice to make, and she‚Äôs damned if she does and damned if she doesn‚Äôt.‚ÄùSmith added: ‚ÄúWill the public care about the constitutional niceties? How much the Queen fulfils the public‚Äôs expectations and hopes will determine how much the parliamentary crisis becomes a royal crisis.‚ÄùFor the record, a YouGov poll in the run-up to last year‚Äôs royal marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle found that seven in 10 Britons support Britain continuing to have a monarchy.The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has told BBC Radio 5 Live that ‚Äúopposition parties will be more united‚Äù as a result of Boris Johnson‚Äôs prorogation of parliament. She described the move as ‚Äúunconstitutional and unlawful‚Äù and said she had ‚Äúlittle doubt that the courts will step up to protect our parliament and parliamentary democracy‚Äù.They think they can get away with shutting down parliament because it‚Äôs inconvenient, and that is unconstitutional and unlawful in our country ‚Ä¶ None of us voted for a prime minister to shut down parliament because it‚Äôs annoying.Chakrabarti said the first step would be to mount a parliamentary challenge, before considering legal action.We will work across parties to defeat this strategy in parliament. And I hope it doesn‚Äôt come to it, but if down the road it ends up in the courts, I have little doubt that the courts will step up to protect our parliament and parliamentary democracy.She also said of Boris Johnson:He‚Äôs been getting away with blue murder, but this time he‚Äôs gone too far.That petition is now at 175,000 signatures. It had 14,000 just over two hours ago. Once a petition gets more than 100,000 signatures it must be considered for a debate in parliament.You can see where in the country the signatories come from by looking at this heatmap. It‚Äôs interesting to see the dark red patches in places such as London, Brighton, Oxford and Cambridge, as well as the more affluent parts of big northern cities such as Manchester and Sheffield.Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will do everything it can to prevent what he described as a ‚Äúsmash and grab‚Äù operation on the part of the government.‚ÄúI have protested in the strongest possible terms on behalf of my party and all the other opposition parties that are going to join in with this in saying that suspending parliament is not acceptable, It‚Äôs not on,‚Äù the Labour leader said in a clip pooled to broadcasters.‚ÄúWhat the prime minister is doing is a sort of smash and grab on our democracy in order to force through a no-deal exit from the European Union. What is he so afraid of that he has to suspend parliament in order to prevent parliament discussing these matters?Corbyn said the first thing Labour would do was to put forward legislation to prevent the suspension, and than there would be a challenge in the form of a vote of no confidence.Asked about plans by a cross-party group of MPs to hold an alternative parliament, and calls by some Labour MPs for people to take to the streets, he replied: ‚ÄúWe will do everything that we can. We will join everybody else in doing that.‚ÄùMick Whelan, the general secretary of the train drivers‚Äô trade union, Aslef, has said Boris Johnson‚Äôs decision to ‚Äútry to sideline parliament in the run-up to Brexit‚Äù could cause civil unrest.Whatever your views on Brexit, the democratic process must underpin what is done in all our names ‚Äì or civil unrest will be the result.It is disturbing that a prime minister who only has a mandate from the Conservative party and not from the electorate is trying to undermine the foundations of our democracy.And while people did vote, three years ago, to leave the European Union, no one voted to leave without a deal. The best way forward is to call a general election and let the people decide.The political commentator Paul Mason has called on people to gather in central London tonight to protest against the government‚Äôs planned suspension of parliament.‚Äôs chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, has a useful caveat here on how much parliamentary time will be lost through the prorogation.In practice, MPs are only likely to lose between four and six sitting days in parliament, depending on which day parliament is prorogued in the second week of September. MPs would have been due to hold conference recess from 12 September until 7 October. Given that MPs do not generally sit on Fridays, it means MPs will not be able to sit for four days until the following Monday, 14 October. They could also lose days in the second week of September, depending on what day parliament is prorogued in the week beginning 9 September. However, one key new obstacle is that any legislation that is incomplete ahead of prorogation will fall, meaning MPs would have to pass any anti-no-deal legislation in its entirety either before prorogation or in the three weeks leading up to 31 October.Jeremy Corbyn has written to the Queen expressing concern about the move by Boris Johnson, reports our colleague Heather Stewart.The Labour MP Clive Lewis has said the police will have to remove him and other MPs from the chamber of the House of Commons if parliament is shut down.Charlie Falconer, the Labour peer and former lord chancellor, has also been tweeting:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a22e3f9e70a5a4bfd4fcc9774b60f0eb9e4b816/0_82_5022_3012/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a69cb1972548c04563dedada3500156","title":"childhood happiness lowest level in decade says report","story":"Charity describes finding that 200,000 are not content with their lives as ‚Äònational scandal‚ÄôChildhood happiness has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, with more than 200,000 children unhappy with their lives, according to a report.For the first time since it was launched in 2009-10, the annual Good Childhood report found overall contentment among 10- to 15-year-olds has dipped below eight on a scale of one to 10. It now stands at 7.89 on average, down from a high of 8.21 in 2011, at a time when adult wellbeing is improving.The Children‚Äôs Society, which conducted the research, said the decline in childhood happiness was a national scandal. The charity called on Boris Johnson to move the issue to the top of his agenda and introduce a national measurement of children‚Äôs wellbeing.The report is based on an annual survey of about 2,400 households and a longitudinal study involving 40,000 households.It found a significant dip in contentment about friends and school among both boys and girls and an increase in unhappiness among boys about their appearance.Asked why he is unhappy with his appearance, one boy surveyed said: ‚ÄúLike Instagram and stuff, right? You see all these models, you see all these weightlifters, bodybuilders, and you look at yourself and you‚Äôre like: ‚ÄòI look like a stick.‚Äô I feel like we‚Äôre exposed to a lot more, so we are less secure about our appearance.‚ÄùRichard Crellin, the policy and research manager at the Children‚Äôs Society, said the research provided observational data, so it was difficult to pinpoint reasons for the decline in childhood happiness.‚ÄúThe latest ONS data for adults suggests wellbeing is increasing and improving. Adults tend to be slightly less happy than children, but the proportion with high wellbeing is improving, whereas it is declining for children.‚ÄùMark Russell, the chief executive of the Children‚Äôs Society, said: ‚ÄúModern childhood is a happy and carefree time for most, yet for too many it is not. It is a national scandal that children‚Äôs unhappiness is increasing so quickly.‚ÄúWe are urging the government to introduce a national measurement of children‚Äôs wellbeing so we can really listen, respond and show young people they matter.‚ÄùJonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the report should act as ‚Äúwake-up call to ministers‚Äù.He added: ‚ÄúOur children‚Äôs health should be a national priority, yet after nine years of austerity, the government‚Äôs response to the issue of child health has been piecemeal as it continues to squeeze the NHS and take money from our public health system and schools.‚ÄùA government spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúWe want young people growing up in a modern Britain to feel confident tackling the challenges life throws at them.

But since launching a blog about the menopause in 2017, she has become a prominent campaigner on the subject.Mathews believes the subject is not discussed as much as it should be. ‚ÄúWe need to talk about the menopause as loudly and as much as we can because we have to get past the stigma and shame our society places on the menopause,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe have to break the taboo.‚ÄùNow 53 and on hormone replacement therapy, Mathews started going through her menopause at 49, although she now thinks she was perimenopausal in her early 40s. It hit her hard, but she had no idea what was going on.‚ÄúThe only thing I knew about the menopause was hot flushes and no more periods ‚Äì but I wasn‚Äôt getting those two symptoms,‚Äù she says. Mathews later found out through her own research that she had been suffering 32 of the 34 lesser-known symptoms of menopause, including burning mouth, mood swings, problems sleeping, hair loss and low libido. Her GP prescribed her antidepressants to no effect.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbsp‚ÄúBut I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone: my mum had recently died, so I couldn‚Äôt talk to her, and we all know about ‚ÄòMeg Mathews‚Äô rock and roll lifestyle‚Äô,‚Äù she says, referring to her reputation as a fixture on the 1990s Britpop party scene ‚Äì she was married to Oasis‚Äôs Noel Gallagher for four years. ‚ÄúI thought it had all caught up with me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI told everyone I had glandular fever and didn‚Äôt go out of the house for three months.‚ÄùThen, at an AA meeting, she stood up to tell the room that she thought she was going mad. ‚ÄúA woman approached me afterwards, saying that I wasn‚Äôt going mad I was having my menopause. I went to an NHS menopause clinic, which I didn‚Äôt even know existed, and the light switched on. I was like, ‚ÄòOh God, I have had all those years feeling like this ‚Äì why isn‚Äôt it talked about?‚Äô‚ÄùMaking sure the menopause is talked about has become one of Matthew‚Äôs driving forces. In 2017, she started a blog about the menopause. It features articles and Q\u0026ampAs from menopause specialists, real-life experiences ‚Äì including her own ‚Äì and lists of products Mathews says have helped her.The blog has been a runaway success, with a million visitors in its first six months. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve held two conferences in London with a range of the country‚Äôs best specialists talking on a wide range of topics. For the second one, in May this year, the tickets sold out,‚Äù she says.Mathews has given talks in unlikely places, including at the Foreign Office‚Äôs services ision: ‚ÄúThey opened the phone lines to every embassy and Commonwealth office around the world so that they could listen in, too,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt went so well that they invited me back to their main office in Milton Keynes to talk to their employees there.‚ÄùShe has spoken at the British Library and the BBC, and is in discussions to speak at another government department.This, says Mathews, is just the start. ‚ÄúI want to take my conferences nationwide,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI want to help women create a sisterhood network, like Weight Watchers, where they meet weekly in a village hall-type setting to discuss their symptoms and swap advice because many women don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to ‚Äì we‚Äôre in a bubble in London. I have learned everything just through my network of women.‚ÄùMathews plans to lobby the government for trained nurse practitioners to act as the first port of call for women experiencing menopausal symptoms ‚Äì and to persuade writers of soaps to include a menopause storyline.‚ÄúThere have been storylines about paedophiles, rape, murders and drug addiction, LGBT issues ‚Äì but they have never had Bet Lynch behind the bar having a hot sweat,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSoaps play a pivotal role in helping to start conversations within families on a national scale. So many women probably don‚Äôt know how to explain to their husbands what‚Äôs going on. But if it was on a TV show as a storyline, it‚Äôd be ‚Äòlook at what‚Äôs going on in EastEnders, she‚Äôs got the menopause!‚Äô‚Äù"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

I‚Äôm not fussed about it at all,‚Äù he said in a development that will almost certainly force the governing body of men‚Äôs tennis to suspend the Australian, having already said it was considering such a move.‚ÄúI was fined $113K for what? Why are we talking about something that happened three weeks ago when I just chopped up someone first round of a US Open?‚ÄùUS Open officials had given Kyrgios the green light to play the final grand slam of the year despite tennis chiefs continuing to weigh up whether or not the temperamental talent should be suspended for his latest outburst in Cincinnati.The ATP offered no time line around when it would make any decision on Kyrgios‚Äôs fate when quizzed on the eve of the Open, which started on Monday.Believed to be the biggest fine in the sport‚Äôs history, Kyrgios was slapped with separate penalties for an audible obscenity, ball abuse, verbal abuse towards the umpire, leaving the court and four counts of unsportsmanlike conduct during his explosive second-round loss to Karen Khachanov.In addition to the fines, the ATP said it was ‚Äúlooking further into what happened during and immediately after the match to see if additional action is warranted under the Player Major Offence section of the code and that could result in an additional fine andor suspension‚Äù.But the 24-year-old was unrepentant after progressing to the second round at Flushing Meadows.‚ÄúHave you ever sworn at someone before?‚Äù he countered at a journalist. ‚Äú... You‚Äôre not an elite athlete.‚Äù Asked if he was saying it was acceptable for elite athletes to swear, he said: ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm just saying people get frustrated. It happens.‚ÄùEarlier, Kyrgios delivered heaps of brilliant shotmaking and a sprinkle of controversy in his 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 win that put him into a second-round meeting with Frenchman Antoine Hoang, who beat Argentine Leonardo Mayer.Kyrgios was laser-focused for the first half of the match as he deployed a lethal mix of monster serves, stinging forehands and smart net play but nearly unravelled when he got agitated over a fan who interrupted his ball toss. The 28th seed was serving at 4-4 in the second set when a woman trying to get to her seat entered his line of sight during his serve, at which point an annoyed Kyrgios asked aloud if she was alright. Kyrgios then looked to the chair umpire who said he could not have prevented the interruption because he did not see it since he was focused on the players. But a clearly perturbed Kyrgios was not happy with that explanation and following a verbal exchange was given a code violation warning for an audible obscenity. After Kyrgios held serve to go 5-4 up he resumed his back-and-forth with the umpire on the changeover at which point a clearly annoyed Johnson asked his opponent when he was going to ‚Äúplay fucking tennis‚Äù. Kyrgios, who has repeatedly got in trouble for on-court actions and is known for his short temper, did not let the incident affect his sublime play as he settled right back down to business. The Australian blitzed Johnson in the second set tiebreak where he showed his lighter side when he broke into a little dance after chasing down a dropshot he sent back for a brilliant crosscourt winner and a commanding 6-0 cushion. ‚ÄúIt was pretty clean,‚Äù Kyrgios said of the tiebreak. ‚ÄúI knew it was an important set. If he got that set the match could have been different and we‚Äôd still be playing right now.‚Äù Johnson, who was being thoroughly outplayed, did manage to finally earn his first break to get to within 3-1 in the third set but Kyrgios relied on his massive serve to carry him over the finish line.

At some point on Sunday afternoon I yelled out of the window: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to come and see this! It‚Äôs the most astonishing game!‚Äù A languorous, world-weary voice replied from the garden: ‚ÄúCricket! Always astonishing. Always historic. Always unprecedented.‚Äù She never budged.It is true that this was cricket‚Äôs second astonishing-historic-unprecedented Sunday in six weeks. It is also true it was being shown on Sky, whose policy is that everything must be treated as a-h-u even if it‚Äôs a goalless draw between Barrow and Boreham Wood. Which makes it hard to recognise an a-h-u when you see it. And on Sunday we really did (except our visitor).On such occasions, it is easy to get confused between a great game and a great finish. The World Cup final was a fairly typical 50-over contest, spiced up by the gravity of the occasion and the StokesButtler‚Äëled revival of the England innings. Planet Earth spectacularly lurched off its axis in the final moments but Headingley ‚Äô19 had more.There have been 2,358 Test matches played since 1877. In terms of closeness Headingley 2019 has a lot of competition. Two Tests have been tied, both involving Australia, against West Indies and India. Two have been drawn with the scores level and the fourth innings still in progress, the first being the ‚Äúwe flippin‚Äô murdered ‚Äôem‚Äù Test in Bulawayo in 1996, named after the scorecard-defying response of England‚Äôs coach, David Lloyd, perhaps the most quoted of all his many quotable comments.There has been a one-run win (West Indies over Australia in 1993), a two- runner (Edgbaston 2005 of beloved memory) and two three‚Äërunners, also both Ashes Tests, at Old Trafford in 1902 and Melbourne 80 years later. This time England‚Äôs win was by one wicket, which is in itself no big deal. It was the 14th in all and not even the first this year (Sri Lanka did the same to South Africa in February).Indeed, 18 Ashes Tests have been decided by one or two wickets or fewer than 20 runs. The score in these matches is 13-5 to England, and Australia‚Äôs last win was in 1925. This stat must mean something but I‚Äôm not sure what. The British ability to defy seemingly impossible odds (Betfair made them a 35-1 chance at one stage on Sunday)?England were of course 500-1 at Headingley in 1981 but that was more PR stunt than serious assessment. There is a school of thought that this long-ago win wrecked English cricket for years, making the team dependent on blind optimism rather than logic, practice and application. For God‚Äôs sake don‚Äôt pass the 13-5 figure to Downing Street. It‚Äôll make things 10 times worse.Many superlatives have been offered these past couple of days. For Ben Stokes and his magnificent sidekick Jack Leach: Sancho Panza to his Quixote Tonto to his Lone Ranger Passepartout to his Phileas Fogg. Their stand passes the a-h-u exam with flying colours. Stokes took dozens of risks and got away with them brilliantly. It was indeed the stuff of fiction. But the greatest innings of all time, as some suggest? It might not be quite the same (an old fogey writes) as a few of Don Bradman‚Äôs.Assessing whether this was the greatest cricket match ever played is also tricky. Quality would be one criterion and, as we all know, England‚Äôs first-innings batting was atrocious. And Australia were without their best player. You do remember Steve Smith? But you can only play the opposition who turn up and quality is also hard to quantify. All sport is about making fewer mistakes than the opposition.Was Headingley compelling from start to finish? Almost. Australia‚Äôs second innings was a dire time but perhaps not to an Australian. And in hindsight that slow buildup of English pain was crucial to the plot ‚Äì the way great detective novels accrete evidence, all pointing to the wrong suspect.Above all, because the Ashes were on the line, presumed already won and lost, the match had context. Headingley in 1981 and Edgbaston in 2005 were important battles that turned the tide at the time but both came early in the series and neither could have settled the war on their own, whoever won.The most enjoyable Test I watched involved Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart defying the West Indies quicks and conjuring a three-wicket victory in Trinidad in 1998. But that was a very personal memory and meant little in the great scheme of things. Athers was gone as captain five weeks later, something that may yet happen to Joe Root in three.The most compelling I remember was the Centenary Test at Melbourne in March 1977. The Ashes were not at stake ‚Äì it was a one-off ‚Äì and it was invisible from Britain but the memory of listening from my dingy flat to Derek Randall‚Äôs epic 174 is with me for ever. Hardly anyone knew the camaraderie of that occasion was greased by the fact most of the players were plotting to desert Test cricket and join the breakaway led by the tycoon Kerry Packer.The original tied Test, in Brisbane in 1960, had an impact that surged across the cricketing world. Hardly anyone saw it at the time ‚Äì even Australia‚Äôs No 1 commentator, Alan McGilvray, was so certain of defeat he took an early plane home. But it set up a terrific series: the excitement, after much dourness in the 1950s, the class of the players and the amity between the teams helped rekindle enthusiasm for the game.With that match a close second, I think ‚Äì for its twists, turns and thrills and its collective and inidual sense of redemption ‚Äì Headingley ‚Äô19 may be the best of them all.Note to readers: The above column contains no criticism of the ECB, ICC, MCC or any other component of the alphabet soup that runs cricket.

That the title, which will move him above Juan Manuel Fangio and behind only Michael Schumacher, is in his grasp is beyond doubt. He has already won eight races, to lead his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by 62 points, and Hamilton usually only improves on the run-in. Last year he won four of the first five races after the summer break nine races remain, starting with this weekend‚Äôs Belgian grand prix, and with four more victories he will have surpassed his previous best of 11 in a season. Hamilton has been explicit in insisting he is taking nothing for granted yet he is in the form of his life and motivated as never before. Closing out the championship by leaving the opposition scattered and reeling will be his target as Schumacher‚Äôs record seven titles looks eminently reachable next season.This time last year Formula One looked a world away for the London-born Thai driver Alexander Albon. Yet when racing resumes he will make his debut for Red Bull in his rookie season after only 12 F1 races. He was set to compete in Formula E‚Äôs 2018-19 season until a late call-up to Toro Rosso. He has impressed there and as Pierre Gasly fell apart at Red Bull they unexpectedly promoted the 23-year-old Albon into a race-winning car, alongside the intimidating No 1 driver, Max Verstappen. With few alternatives on offer and Red Bull desperate to have a driver to back up Verstappen at the front, a strong performance could secure Albon‚Äôs place for next season and beyond. He was impressive in coming up to speed at Toro Rosso with little preparation and the Red Bull should suit his smooth driving style. Albon has an opportunity most drivers can only dream of how he faces the challenge will be fascinating.After a process that began soon after Liberty took over the sport in 2017, the end-of-October deadline for signing-off new regulations for 2021 looms large. Delayed once this year already, the plan devised by the director of motor sports, Ross Brawn, intended to improve the racing could not be of greater import. What is agreed will shape the sport and what has already been a tortuous process is likely to become increasingly tense as the days count down. Several midfield teams have warned the proposals are in danger of being watered down by the leading marques, who want to maintain their advantage. Equally, a new concorde agreement between competitors and Liberty has yet to be signed for 2021. Confidence in how competitive they can be under the new regulations will play a part for the smaller teams in those negotiations, with Gene Haas already warning F1 has to make sporting and financial sense if teams such as his are to remain. This is the first vital test for F1 in the Liberty era.Mercedes have swept into the distance in the constructors‚Äô championship, 150 points clear of Ferrari, but behind them every race is vital. Ferrari are still struggling with their car and winless, while Red Bull are snapping at their heels thanks to Verstappen‚Äôs two victories. They trail the Scuderia by 44 points and the Dutchman is third, ahead of Sebastian Vettel, in the drivers‚Äô championship. Verstappen and Red Bull clearly sense Ferrari blood in the water. The team have gone from strength to strength and if Albon can perform where Gasly failed, they could take the fight for second to the wire. Behind them McLaren are a team reborn with Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz revelling in their competitive car. They are fourth in the championship, 39 points in front of Toro Rosso and 43 in front of Renault. After the turmoil of recent years they look to be firing collectively, reminiscent of the team that once towered over the sport. Holding fourth would be their best finish since 2012 but it is far from a given a tooth-and-nail scrap may well define the midfield run-in.Jockeying in the drivers‚Äô market will begin in earnest when racing resumes at Spa. The decision that will likely set the dominoes in motion is whether Mercedes will drop Bottas for their protege Esteban Ocon as Hamilton‚Äôs partner. Toto Wolff, the team principal, said they would consider it over the summer and it seems likely they will announce their choice, now expected to be to stick with Bottas, at Spa. There is considerable trading still to be done, however. The Red Bull drive might yet be open should Albon not make the grade and, although highly unlikely, a return to his former team has been rumoured for Vettel, despite the German being contracted with Ferrari until the end of the 2020 season. Romain Grosjean at Haas, Antonio Giovinazzi at Alfa Romeo and Renault‚Äôs Nico H√ºlkenberg are all out of contract and the last of these is expected to be replaced by Ocon should Mercedes retain Bottas. Racing Point are likely to stick with Lance Stroll and Sergio P√©rez, as will Williams with George Russell, but the latter will likely replace Robert Kubica with their reserve driver Nicholas Latifi. McLaren have already confirmed Norris and Sainz for next season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16eaa395ed007785d95e710a62d1b119a2594d9a/0_85_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14c0c6c15122f5fb99de7f871e8352e","title":"shock and bore how dave chappelle lost his comic touch","story":"In his controversial Michael Jackson-defending, trans-attacking Netflix special, the once-groundbreaking comedian shows his power has been diminishedIt all goes back to Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor, or at least the reputation they left behind as a legacy. The two continue to inspire up-and-coming comedians due to their lionized status as embattled truth-tellers, men whose jokes were so searingly incisive about human hypocrisy that the culture‚Äôs tongue-cluckers couldn‚Äôt handle the truth. Bruce in particular stands today as something between a rock star and martyr, the angry young subversive with a tight fifteen so powerful that the squares had to put him in handcuffs and drag him off the stage. At the time, rabble-rousers like Bruce and Pryor knew they were doing something right when people got angry at them. They prided themselves on it, in the knowledge that shaking the foundations of the old guard ‚Äì their religion, their etiquette, their sexual hangups ‚Äì made their voices vital and exciting.This is almost certainly how Dave Chappelle sees himself, judging from the material and delivery in Sticks and Stones, his fifth stand-up special recorded as part of his twenty-million-a-pop deal with Netflix. He opens with an epigram from Kendrick Lamar, triumphantly declaring, ‚ÄúTell me somethin‚Äô  you mothafuckas can‚Äôt tell me nothin‚Äô  I‚Äôd rather die than to listen to you.‚Äù It‚Äôs a defiant middle finger extended in the direction of the critics, notifying whatever haters may have tuned in out of perverse curiosity that he will not be deterred by their words. Indeed, Chappelle has come under fire as of late for saying things he should not say, the very same charge that Bruce and Pryor were slapped with decades earlier. But only if a person thinks about the ire directed at these provocateurs that broadly, with no mind to the specifics of their respective situations, does the comparison hold up.A single moment‚Äôs consideration would reveal that there‚Äôs a big difference between Lamar telling the hosts of Fox News that he won‚Äôt be their talking point in bad-faith conversations about the societal effects of hip-hop, and Dave Chappelle taking potshots at the transgender community. Trans people ‚Äì referred to as ‚Äúthe Ts‚Äù in an extended run about ‚Äúthe alphabet people‚Äù that make up the LGBTQ community, as if Chappelle will melt like the Wicked Witch of the West if he even says the word ‚Äì really take it on the shins, but they‚Äôve got plenty of company. Chappelle speaks out against Michael Jackson‚Äôs accusers, stating in no uncertain terms that ‚ÄúI do not believe these motherfuckers‚Äù to whistles and cheers of approval from the audience. An assortment of his hotter takes plays like an exoneration wishlist: Kevin Hart‚Äôs a good guy, Louis CK never did anything wrong, and even if the King of Pop did prey on innocent children, ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs Michael Jackson.‚ÄùChappelle likes to play sheepish when airing what he knows will be his more polarizing opinions, repeatedly doing the classic ‚Äúdrop the punch line, throw your hands up, and walk upstage‚Äù bit to playact stepping away from the fallout of his jokes. He puts on the Bugs Bunny gee-ain‚Äôt-I-a-stinker face as he qualifies with transparent sarcasm, ‚ÄúFar be it from me to offend anybody!‚Äù He even gives the timeless defense of the indefensible and mentions more than once that he has gay friends, perhaps in the hopes that they will form a protective phalanx around his ideas.The public hailed Chappelle as a shit-stirring seer for so long, and for the most part rightly, that he cannot part with that image of himself even as it rapidly sours. In the worst-case scenario, this trajectory ultimately sends him the way of Ricky Gervais, currently locked in an increasingly sweaty campaign to get a rise out of his audience with the same tired jabs. That‚Äôs the most meaningful front on which Sticks and Stones fails for all his power to offend, Chappelle has utterly lost the power to shock.The predictability has been the most dispiriting part about watching the master lose his touch over the past couple of specials. Excepting one little tease facetiously implying that he may have had sex with a fourteen-year-old, none of the lines raise an eyebrow. We‚Äôre locked into a routine, both the performer and the critical corps professionally obligated to take his bait, his transgressions every bit as preordained as our objections to them. Even for someone uninterested in pondering the particulars of who he‚Äôs making angry and why, Chappelle‚Äôs got to recognize another major difference between his predecessors and himself in their reception. Those familiar with his recent output click into the newest knowing full well what they‚Äôre in for, leading to the same restricting self-selection of opinion that one might otherwise find on Fox News, Chappelle‚Äôs secondhand enemy left unnamed in Lamar‚Äôs quotation. Forefathers like Bruce and Pryor reveled in infiltrating the mainstream with beliefs so progressive about sex, race, and culture as to be dangerous. Chappelle would rather retreat into his niche as an old crank, where all is expected and safe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7255fb86e59e9abc21db47cdc477e4928517f61/10_285_2124_1274/master/2124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ea83c358bb72f3b45f943c9948e8d59","title":"apple ends contracts hundreds workers hired to listen siri","story":"At least 300 contractors in Europe sent home after ‚Äògrading‚Äô project suspendedHundreds of Apple workers across Europe who were employed to check Siri recordings for errors have lost their jobs after the company announced it was suspending the programme earlier this month.More than 300 employees have had their contracts ended in the company‚Äôs Cork facility alone, according to former employees, with more sent home from other sites across Europe.The staff had been on paid leave since 2 August, the day Apple announced its decision to suspend the programme, referred to as ‚Äúgrading‚Äù, as it conducted ‚Äúa thorough review‚Äù.The decision followed a story in the  that revealed the workers frequently heard confidential medical information and couples having sex while checking the Siri recordings.The graders, employed through contracting firms, were sent home that Friday, with many told there was no work for them due to ‚Äútechnical errors‚Äù.However, last week the contracting firms were told by Apple that the grading work would be terminated, leading to the mass job losses with little notice.Even among those employees who were concerned by the ethics of the programme, there has been anger about how the job losses have proceeded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm relieved this information came out,‚Äù said one former contractor who asked to remain anonymous due to a still-active non-disclosure agreement, ‚Äúalthough I was involved in the work and I just lost my job.

Wright denies there was a partnership.A US district court in Florida on Tuesday ruled that half of the bitcoin mined and half of the intellectual property held by Wright from that time belongs to Kleiman.One issue is it is not known exactly how much bitcoin Wright holds. It has been claimed that the Kleiman estate could get anywhere between 410,000 and 500,000 bitcoin, putting the value at between A$6.1bn and A$7.4bn as of Wednesday.Wright claimed to the court that he couldn‚Äôt access the bitcoin because he doesn‚Äôt have a list of the public addresses of that bitcoin. He claimed in 2011, after seeing the cryptocurrency had begun to be associated with drug dealers and human traffickers, he put the bitcoin he mined in 2009 and 2010 into an encrypted file and into a blind trust. The encrypted key was ided into multiple key slices, and the key slices were given to Kleiman who distributed them to people through the trust.Wright said this meant he could not decrypt the file until he gets access to the key from a bonded courier who will arrive in January 2020 ‚Äì a claim Wright has made before in claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.In the judgment, Judge Bruce Reinhart said Wright had not proved he could not comply and obtain the bitcoin. He said Wright made inconsistent statements and the whole story was ‚Äúinconceivable‚Äù that he‚Äôd had a Dr Frankenstein-like revelation when his creation ‚Äúturned to evil‚Äù.‚ÄúDuring his testimony, Dr. Wright‚Äôs demeanor did not impress me as someone who was telling the truth. When it was favorable to him, Dr. Wright appeared to have an excellent memory and a scrupulous attention to detail. Otherwise, Dr. Wright was belligerent and evasive,‚Äù Reinhart said.In 2015, Wright was investigated by the Australian Taxation Office over his involvement with bitcoin with his Sydney home raided by the Australian federal police, leading to speculation he might be Nakamoto.In 2016, Wright claimed he was Nakamoto, but experts questioned the evidence he provided. He promised to provide further proof, but backed down days later, saying he was ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and did ‚Äúnot have the courage‚Äù.Reinhart said at the start of his ruling the court ‚Äúis not required to decide, and does not decide‚Äù whether Wright is Nakamoto, and the court was not required to decide and did not decide how much bitcoin Wright controls today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833edc16435de60d406f1a7367fc5f25b02be4c9/0_205_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec257a2b3ea255833e8a11875b9221","title":"mix it up the mixologists guide to drinking rum","story":"Still drinking gin? Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum‚Äôs craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it‚Äôs as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain‚Äôs Blood ‚Äì a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that‚Äôs perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter‚Äôs Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: ‚ÄúInexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn‚Äôt quite the same.‚Äù Cotter‚Äôs all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York‚Äôs Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It‚Äôs part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: ‚ÄúThere is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.‚ÄùMia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson‚Äôs favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat ‚Äì by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them ‚Äì then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn‚Äôt try at home. It‚Äôs an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock‚Äôs bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg‚Äôs take on his retro favourite uses three rums ‚Äì Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof ‚Äì along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil‚Äôs Kiss won‚Äôt tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama‚Äôaina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil‚Äôs Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama‚Äôaina in a specialist bar.

When it makes spiced rum too. Find out what inspired Lyme Bay Winery to take the plunge with this dark and stormy spiritThere can be little doubt about it: Britain likes a drink. Considered by some as the core of the ‚Äúdrinksphere‚Äù, it‚Äôs home to pioneers in everything from cider to gin, but rum has barely registered on the radar. Unless you‚Äôre James Lambert, managing director of Lyme Bay Winery, that is.‚ÄúWe wanted to make a spiced rum, but not as we know it,‚Äù says Lambert, whose winery is set just a few miles from the sandy Devon coastline. The location is intricately entwined with the creation of their signature dark spirit, whose full name ‚Äì Jack Ratt‚Äôs Lugger Spiced Rum ‚Äì comes from infamous smuggler Jack Rattenbury.‚ÄúReading Jack‚Äôs book, Memoirs of a Smuggler, it just spoke to us, as it‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all about. There‚Äôs cheekiness, innovation and that sense of trying to be a little bit roguish ‚Äì we just felt his character suited so well what we were trying to do with the rum,‚Äù says Lambert. In true Rattenbury form, the winery is not afraid to venture into the unknown. ‚ÄúWe have a bit of an obsession with all things ‚Äòoff the beaten path‚Äô, says sales manager Sara Walters, who has worked at Lyme Bay for 10 years. ‚ÄúThe fact that there was no one in Devon making a spiced rum made for an irresistible challenge, particularly given our rich smuggling history.‚ÄùTaking inspiration from these tales, Lyme Bay embarked on its own voyage of discovery. It created a bottle design to convey the spirit of Jack Rattenbury ‚Äì a black label to match his black-painted boat, and rakish typography ‚Äì all the while showcasing the winery‚Äôs trademark elegance.Upon arriving in Devon, this exotic import is aged in a solera system, where it matures alongside older versions, aged up to six years. After years spent in charred-oak bourbon barrels from Tennessee, the rum is ready to provide the base character for Lugger Rum, bringing with it hints of caramel and molasses to give a complex and superior taste.The second spirit added to the blend is a premium Guyanan rum, ‚Äúfrom the homeland of demerara sugar,‚Äù says Lambert. But if the mention of sugar sets your teeth on edge, don‚Äôt worry: this rum offers a soothing kiss of natural sweetness without having to add excessive amounts of sugar.Spices complete the symphony. Nutmeg, stem and ground stem ginger, cinnamon, orange peel, clove and vanilla are introduced to create an inviting yet complex flavour combination. ‚ÄúThe intention was always to make a high-quality spirit,‚Äù says Lambert. ‚ÄúMany commercial spiced rums have an overpowering vanilla essence, but it was important to us to follow a more craft approach.‚Äù For Lugger Rum, they mellowed out the vanilla tones to bring forward the natural flavours of both rums, re-enforcing them with a distinct array of spices.That‚Äôs all well and good, but one imagines that the rum‚Äôs namesake would ask only one question: ‚ÄúHow do I drink it?‚Äù Although the combination of rums with the charred-oak barrels has created a dark spirit that‚Äôs flawless in cocktails or with simple mixers, I like nothing more than three large ice cubes and a nice splash on the rocks. Sourced from afar, yet aged on our doorstep ‚Äì and sitting at a refreshingly mid-tier price point ‚Äì Lugger Rum is ideal for those who want something a little special in their glass.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

These tales of infamous men ‚Äì whose names have endured for centuries ‚Äì bring to mind the smell of woodsmoke and sea salt, and warming brown spirits sipped from battered tin mugs.And so to Lyme Bay on the unspoilt Jurassic Coast of England‚Äôs south-west, where the fossilised remains of ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs lay waiting to be discovered under the sand and shingle. For more than 100 years smugglers in this area, such as the notorious Jack Rattenbury, would paint their rickety little ‚Äúlugger‚Äù boats black and pack them full of contraband to sell to the highest bidder.Fast forward to today, and these romantic scenes have given way to a vibrant, brilliant mix of influences. Nowhere is this blend of cultures more evident than in the food and drink we have on offer across the UK. Whether it‚Äôs Turkish meze or Korean fried chicken, chances are you‚Äôll be able to find it here. In terms of food and flavours, Britain‚Äôs multiculturalism has always been a string in our bow, and for Lugger Rum ‚Äì which is made in Devon‚Äôs Lyme Bay Winery ‚Äì this international twist is essential to a modern-day rum.Lugger Rum seamlessly blends complex flavours and spices to create a rounded, subtly complex, yet richly flavoured sipping spirit. Here‚Äôs how:The Caribbean connectionTake your windswept Devon coastline and add Trinidadian and Guyanese rum, aged in charred Tennessee barrels to add smoky, vanilla notes. The resulting spirit pulls back on the sweetness thanks to the unique style of these aged rums, unlike many of the commercial, more confected varieties.Spice it upCloves were lauded by Chaucer and Shakespeare for the unique flavour they imparted to ales and pies, and Elizabethan royalty would use them in pomanders to mask unsavoury bodily aromas. During the spice wars of the 17th century ships went to great lengths to bring these spices to our shores.Nutmeg, highly sought after for its curative and mildly hallucinogenic properties, as well as its culinary ones, used to be worth more than livestock per kilogram. Britain couldn‚Äôt get enough of this exotic flavour, and using it became a sign of wealth. Now they‚Äôre two of the spices found in Lugger Rum.The Mediterranean twistLugger‚Äôs flamboyant, citrus peel kick on the finish harks back to Plantagenet times, when expensive deliveries of oranges from the Mediterranean would be requested by Edward I‚Äôs Spanish wife, Eleanor of Castile, to remind her of home. Their beguiling scent permeated London‚Äôs theatre scene during Restoration England, when oranges were sold to theatregoers by wenches such as the infamous Nell Gwyn, who became Charles II‚Äôs mistress.Lugger Rum is the result of centuries of British history and the inquisitive, innovative minds at Lyme Bay Winery. Here is a team who have been helping lead the surge in quality and discovery of English wines, and are now turning their hand to fine spirits. Their rum is a nod to all the delicious things that made the British food and drink scene what it is today, as well as the notorious smugglers who managed to supply more illegal brandy and rum to the West Country than was ever legally imported into the capital. The finish on Lugger Rum is sure to be a little smoother, however, than the contraband hooch dragged up the beach from those little lugger boats.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

Prue Leith ‚Äì she of the showstopper necklaces and compassionate judging ‚Äì is the lion. And Hollywood is the tin man. No heart. ‚ÄúIs it weird that I fancy you now?‚Äù Toksvig asks Fielding as they wander across the lawn and we wait for the theme, the aural equivalent of stepping into a warm bath, to kick in. ‚ÄúSo do I,‚Äù mutters Hollywood. Hil. Ar. I. Ous.It‚Äôs cake week, and the signature challenge is a fruit cake, which is all about batter consistency. Too thin and the fruit drops to the bottom, too thick and ‚Ä¶ whatevs. What we‚Äôre really interested in is the texture of the contestants. Will we be blessed with a Nadiya or Rahul? Who‚Äôs going to be the anal Brendan-y one? (Henry, without a doubt: just look at his royal iced house). The posh one who induces automatic fond eye-rolls whenever they mention using pullet eggs from their own chickens? (A toss-up between vet Rosie and geography teacher Alice). The clumsy one? (Michael: he keeps cutting himself but still makes a treasure chest cake with about three fingers.) As all Bake Off fans know, the ideal contestant will be the perfect cake mix of wit, compassion, baking flair, self-deprecation, team spirit, and comedy stress responses. It‚Äôs too early to say, but I‚Äôm keeping an eye on Steph and Michelle.Much has been made of how young the group is this year, and it‚Äôs true that seven out of 13 are in their 20s. Jamie, 20, is easily the silliest. One of those inexplicable people who looks like he‚Äôs having the best time even while failing to add eggs to his caramel schnauzer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like mixing concrete,‚Äù he grins. Special mention, also, to Helena, who ‚Äúlives like every day is Halloween‚Äù and makes the droopiest bat wings ever crafted out of sugar. ‚ÄúFrom one goth to another I know you‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù Fielding reassures her. God love him, and all goths who bake. Her genoise is so rubbery, she says, that if it fell on the floor it would bounce right back. Tragically, this doesn‚Äôt happen.But her showstopper leads to the episode‚Äôs best moment. Based on the fairy garden Helena imagined as a child, she explains that she now has an actual fairy garden at home. Hollywood looks a bit smirky. Turns out he thought she said furry garden. Oooooh, naughty! ‚ÄúOh Paul,‚Äù says Helena, slightly hysterical. ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre thinking.‚Äù Cue a query about how big her furry garden is, at which point I started to miss Mary Berry, because her confused-amused face would have been priceless.No matter.

The PD succumbed to demands from M5S for Giuseppe Conte, who last week ended the fraught alliance between the party and the far-right League, to be reinstated as prime minister. The PD has insisted that the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, steps down as deputy prime minister in return.To complicate matters, M5S said it would ask members to vote on any deal agreed with the PD on Rousseau, the online network it often uses to make policy decisions. The vote would only takes place if Mattarella gives the parties a mandate to form a government.The chaos was prompted by the deputy PM and interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who dramatically withdrew the League from its coalition government with M5S this month as he sought to exploit his high popularity to force snap elections in an effort to become the next prime minister.Di Maio and Nicola Zingaretti, the PD leader, have been under pressure to strike a deal in an attempt to avert elections that could create western Europe‚Äôs first fully far-right government, despite their personal reservations and resistance from factions within their parties.Mattarella, who has the power to dissolve parliament and call new elections, will hold consultations with leaders from Italy‚Äôs main parties ‚Äì the PD, Forza Italia, the League and M5S ‚Äì from 4pm (CET).

Winners of an Africa-wide competition were rewarded with an ‚Äúeducational‚Äù trip to Russia that included visits to a nuclear power plant and the ‚Äúscience city‚Äù of Obninsk. Rosatom is among international groups that are exporting light-water technology, which is generally considered among the safest, and is building a $13bn light-water reactor in Bangladesh. But such reactors typically generate more than 1,000 megawatts and very few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to distribute that amount of power.Nuclear power‚Äôs supporters argue that the lengthy construction times of nuclear reactors allow poorer countries to build up their infrastructure. But N√©vine Schepers, a nuclear expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said light-water technology was not suited to many African countries.‚ÄúIn terms of economic sense smaller countries that have a long way to go to develop their grids would be better off aiming for something like smaller modular reactors,‚Äù she said.Technology for cheaper reactors that would produce about 300MW is being developed in Russia, China and the US.Another concern is that the expensive projects favoured by Rosatom would not benefit Africa‚Äôs poorest people. In most countries energy is generated in large, centralised plants and distributed over a national grid ‚Äì a model that would be reinforced in Africa by nuclear power.‚ÄúAccess to energy is a basic human right and necessary for a dignified life. The majority of those denied this right live in Africa,‚Äù said Friends of the Earth. ‚ÄúHowever, the expansion of profit-driven nuclear energy in Africa would only exacerbate the problem.‚ÄùThe environmental NGO said the answer to Africa‚Äôs energy needs lay in ‚Äúefficient technology that meets the daily needs of people, in the hands of communities and municipalities, and controlled democratically‚Äù. Only small-scale and interconnected grids that were democratically managed could deliver energy sovereignty to African people, it added.Rosatom has accused Friends of the Earth and other NGOs of ‚Äúhardline anti-nuclear activism ‚Ä¶ based on a position well known for being completely biased and riddled with factual errors‚Äù. It said its priority was ‚Äúsustainable development‚Äù and that nuclear energy was ‚Äúintrinsically immune to any form of political manipulation‚Äù.Selling nuclear technology is part of an effort by Russia to build influence, power and trade across Africa, with growing involvement in nations across the continent.The involvement of Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic and Sudan has attracted significant attention, as has an apparent effort to influence elections in South Africa in May.Many of the African countries that have signed commercial agreements of the kind being pursued by Rosatom are run by movements or iniduals who have long-standing relationships with Russia or ‚Äì more often ‚Äì the USSR.In early April Jo√£o Louren√ßo, the president of Angola, visited Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin and top officials, to discuss arms sales, diamond mining, and gas and oil production. Russia delivered six Su-30K fighter jets to Angola this year and two more are expected in the second part of a billion-dollar deal. Louren√ß, who fought in Angola‚Äôs war of independence against Portugal, studied in Moscow from 1978 to 1982. Angola was a cold-war battleground and the USSR backed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, still the ruling party.Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, said ‚Äúreactivating old Soviet networks‚Äù had been a clear strategy in Moscow for a couple of years. ‚ÄúThe old history can play very positively in some places.‚ÄùPatrick Smith, editor of Africa Confidential, an investigative newsletter, said: ‚ÄúRussians can‚Äôt write big cheques but have mastered the art of making themselves really popular, albeit with some of the worst leaders in Africa. They want the ties too. The more powers they can play off against each other, the better.‚ÄùThe campaign has had setbacks. A deal in South Africa went wrong when Jacob Zuma was  removed from power amid corruption allegations last year. A furore surrounding a $75bn contract to build power stations with a combined 9.6 gigawatt output badly damaged the image of Russia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de56cfd27de0c4ab3b2ee1d11ff931dc2eb8bf07/0_55_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e78850958d35d699b5e25ef97da1e63","title":"tropical storm dorian puerto rico latest","story":"Puerto Rico faces a potential threat to life and property as Tropical Storm Dorian is bearing down on the island on Wednesday, with a warning of wind gusts of up to 90mph in place until early evening.And the impending tempest has whipped up a fresh row between Donald Trump and Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, the capital city of Puerto Rico. The two established a combative relationship after Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria almost two years ago, when US aid was slow to arrive and the president offended many during a visit to the territory.‚ÄúNow is the time to shelter from dangerous wind,‚Äù the warning advised. There was also potential for storm surge flooding up to 2ft above ground. A flash flood watch from anticipated rain was also in effect.‚ÄúPractically the entire island will be under sustained tropical storm-force winds,‚Äù said Roberto Garc√≠a, director of US National Weather Service San Juan, during a press conference late Tuesday.From Puerto Rico, the storm was expected to turn north and sweep to the north-east of the Bahamas through Saturday, and then approach the east coast of Florida as a hurricane on Sunday. A hurricane watch was also in effect for the US Virgin Islands. Trump declared an emergency on Tuesday night and ordered federal assistance for local authorities in Puerto Rico. But in a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump, a climate crisis denier, seemed to complain about Puerto Rico‚Äôs exposure to storms, and escalated a long-running feud with Cruz.On Tuesday night, Cruz said that Trump should ‚Äúget out of the way‚Äù.‚ÄúThree thousand Puerto Ricans did not open their eyes this morning because this racist man did not have it within him to do his job,‚Äù Cruz said on CNN. ‚ÄúSo get out of the way, President Trump.‚ÄùCruz was referring to the death toll from Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. An official report criticized the Trump administration‚Äôs slow response to the devastation from the storm, which destroyed the island‚Äôs power grid and decimated its agriculture and tourism industries.On Tuesday morning, Trump had tweeted about Dorian, and seemed to complain about the cost of hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which have fallen far short of restoring the island.‚ÄúWow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúWill it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for ‚Äòanywhere‚Äô.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs tweet contained a falsehood. That amount, $92bn, would not qualify the Maria relief package as ‚Äúan all-time record‚Äù for the costliest tropical cyclones, according to the federal government‚Äôs own figures. Spending on recovery for Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana the same storm season as Maria, has so far cost $125bn.Since Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled with political turbulence leading to the recent departure of the governor, Ricardo Rossell√≥. Earlier this month, the territory‚Äôs supreme court overturned the swearing-in of Rossell√≥‚Äôs successor, Pedro Pierluisi, and the former justice secretary, Wanda V√°zquez, became governor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d58bc70bab042ea8c7027c977013927fa616802b/0_242_4024_2415/master/4024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ebe9ad2371d28b6d1654fb65641681","title":"women healing rifts central african republic","story":"By creating vibrant economic networks, women in the Central African Republic are coming to terms with the violence they have suffered during their country‚Äôs civil warThe bakers of Bamingui have lost loved ones to war. Rebel soldiers drive past their roadside bread ovens daily. A spectre of violence remains. Regardless, Yvette Abaka and her female baking collective make dough and roll with it.In this impoverished, rebel-held corner of the Central African Republic (CAR), this group of mothers came together last year to better their lot. Since then, their loaves have become a hit in the wider community, promoting the women as their families‚Äô breadwinners and promising further, quietly profound, change.‚ÄúThis bakery makes us more powerful than before,‚Äù says Abaka, the group‚Äôs leader and a 50-year-old mother of two. ‚ÄúMy husband respects my work. Now I am his equal.‚ÄùIn this turbulent country, scarred by years of conflict, Abaka‚Äôs bakers are not the only people hoping for something good to come out of the troubles. Following a major ceasefire brokered earlier this year between the government and 14 rebel militias, groups of women are coming together across the nation to reinforce the grand strategy for peace at a community level. They are rebuilding their country from the ground up, forging formidable sisterhoods in the ashes of a protracted conflict.High rates of sexual violence, maternal mortality and teenage births have made CAR one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. But now female activists, displaced mothers and survivors of rape have joined forces to heal deep wounds and restore trust between opposing ethnic factions as part of an ambitious attempt to mend a broken country in the heart of Africa.Besides Abaka‚Äôs bakers, another group called Femme Debout (‚ÄúWoman Standing‚Äù) is defying religious tensions by bringing together Christian and Muslim widows in Bangui, CAR‚Äôs capital, teaching them commercial skills and helping traumatised iniduals recover collectively. Elsewhere, in camps for displaced people, where people shelter from militants who use sexual violence as a weapon of war, survivors enrol with associations to fight the stigma of rape and to cultivate hope.‚ÄúSuch groups are vital forces for social change,‚Äù says Viola Giuliano, a researcher in CAR for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an NGO focused on civilian protection. ‚ÄúThey are uniquely placed to find and prioritise solutions and enable a sense of ownership of the peace process, which is key for sustainable, long-term reconciliation.‚ÄùEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn the northern village of Bamingui, lead baker Abaka is familiar with such horrors of war, having survived six years of it. In 2013, an alliance of mainly Muslim rebels assembled close to her village before running amok through the rest of the country, committing atrocities and seizing power in a bloody coup d‚Äôetat. In response, ‚Äúanti-balaka‚Äù militias consisting of Christians and animists rose up and carried out revenge attacks against Muslim communities.Increasing waves of violence killed thousands, displaced more than a million people and prompted warnings from the United Nations of an impending genocide. The rebel coalition has since fragmented into numerous armed groups competing over territory and access to mineral reserves.Among the many fatalities was Abaka‚Äôs son. Her brother, aunt and grandfather also perished in the bloodbath. Today, gunmen from the same rebel group that killed them frequently drive past her home and bakery. While the militants‚Äô presence has taken on a surreal air of normality, Abaka‚Äôs war-weary community ‚Äì like others nationwide ‚Äì fear this uneasy truce could shatter at any time.‚ÄúAt first the kids were scared of all these weapons, but now they‚Äôre used to it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut I do worry that the war will begin again. We‚Äôve already lost so much. We cannot afford for it to happen again.‚ÄùDespite these concerns she presses ahead, along with seven friends, with what they do best. They rise at dawn and congregate to scrub baking trays, gather large logs, chop up kindling and light fires in the kilns. Beneath a tin roof, they knead dough into hundreds of rolls. Small ones sell for the equivalent of 7p, a medium one for 14p, a loaf for 35p. Any profit is split between the women, allowing them to buy key household items and reinvest the remainder.Revenues are modest the impact, big. With almost half the country affected by acute food shortages and several regions teetering on the brink of famine, food production for malnourished communities is crucial. The bakers sell to local Muslim families, bringing once-ided communities together to intermingle in the marketplace.‚ÄúThis bakery is the only opportunity we have to make any money by ourselves,‚Äù says Estella Yarsara, Abaka‚Äôs fellow baker and a 27-year-old mother of five. ‚ÄúThis work means I have some extra food for my children too. I do this to help myself and to help my family. We all want to lift up our community.‚ÄùThe job has upended a conservative hierarchy, helping Yarsara challenge her role in society: ‚ÄúIf I have some money and my husband does not, I can intervene and support him. It is making our relationship more equal. I don‚Äôt have to depend on him. I have more strength in the family.‚ÄùTheir bakery opened last September, kickstarted by an EU-funded initiative. While this programme was focused primarily on wildlife conservation in the nearby Bamingui-Bangoran national park, officials were keen to reach out to the wider community. In addition to the bakery operation, other locals are taught how to farm guinea fowl, produce shea butter and air-dry beef in order to reduce an unsustainable dependence on bushmeat.Reverent Yakoudou, a park manager, knows the value of this investment: ‚ÄúWomen are more reliable with money. They use all their profits to look after their family and reinvest in the business.‚Äù Abaka‚Äôs vision for the bakery‚Äôs future confirms this. She hopes eventually to open up a permanent shop, selling their bread among many other products: ‚ÄúThat way we can help our children and our community even more.‚ÄùAlthough separated by hundreds of miles of rebel-held roads, Abaka would find a sister in arms in Florence Atanguere, who runs the Femme Debout women‚Äôs association for widows and orphans in Bangui. Many of its members have suffered displacement and witnessed extreme violence, yet despite the war‚Äôs isions along religious lines, Christians and Muslims are welcomed alike.Supported by UNHCR, the UN‚Äôs refugee agency, the group meets every week on the edge of the capital to discuss their difficulties and successes. From sewing to soap-making, they are taught new skills, helping them foster solidarity and a boisterous, entrepreneurial spirit.‚ÄúLittle by little women are getting together to fight back,‚Äù says Atanguere, a mother of six who saw her brother stabbed to death when rebels stormed her neighbourhood in late 2013. She fled to a squalid camp for displaced people and eventually returned home three years later, founding the association with the women she met there. ‚ÄúWe are sisters. We are all Central Africans. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre Muslim or Christian. Here, we are all equal.‚ÄùWhile the worst of Atanguere‚Äôs ordeal is over, more than 600,000 people remain displaced within CAR, with a similar number uprooted as refugees outside the country. Many of the women have been raped by militants. Yet among these exiled communities, there is resilience and a restless desire to rise above such harrowing circumstances.One of them is 18-year-old C√©leste, who was five months pregnant when rebels attacked her village in northern CAR late one night. Gunshots and the roar of motorbikes woke her. ‚ÄúThey raped many girls and tortured many men,‚Äù said Celeste, just 15 at the time of the attack. She wasn‚Äôt spared either. Four soldiers entered her house, each taking turns to rape her: ‚ÄúMy pregnancy was visible but they still did it anyway.‚ÄùAfterwards, she fled her village and hid in the bush for several days, surviving on whatever she could find to eat. Her distress was amplified by memories of what she had lost. Before the war, she had enjoyed helping her father farm cassava, okra and peanuts, participating at school as an enthusiastic dancer and eager pupil. Now, forced from home, her sense of helplessness grew when she learned a few days later that her fiance ‚Äì the father of her unborn child ‚Äì had been murdered in the course of a car-jacking.C√©leste, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, eventually made it to a displacement camp on the outskirts of a rebel-held town called Kaga Bandoro. She moved into a cramped tent where she saw out the last few months of her pregnancy but could not shake off the psychological and physical pain of the attack. ‚ÄúSleeping at night has been hard,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to forget. I miss my fiance terribly.‚ÄùYet even in this overcrowded and perilous camp, where armed groups freely operate, C√©leste has started to overcome this nightmare. A friend introduced her to a women‚Äôs association where fellow survivors of rape enter a shared process of mutual healing and, together, tackle the stigma of sexual violence.‚ÄúI now feel that I have the strength to deal with what has happened,‚Äù said C√©leste. ‚ÄúThe pastor at church teaches us to forgive, let go and move on. During therapy sessions, we can express ourselves. We talk about what has happened and discuss any problems that we still face.‚ÄùC√©leste and her fellow members are keen to return to school. Their dream: to take up midwifery and help pregnant mothers receive the care that war and poverty have denied them.In spite of the camp‚Äôs dangers and dreadful conditions, her son is now two years old and in relatively good health. With her country edging towards greater stability, C√©leste clings to the hope of a life beyond their tiny, dusty tent ‚Äì for now, the only home her child has ever known.‚Ä¢ Jack Losh is a journalist, photographer and filmmaker with a focus on conflict, conservation and humanitarian issuesThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world‚Äôs most stubborn problems.

The Jesuit school that produced such distinguished alumni as the pioneering minister for education Donagh O‚ÄôMalley, the former chief justice John Murray, broadcaster Terry Wogan and actor Richard Harris has now triumphed in the two guilty pleasures of the summer, Love Island and the Rose of Tralee. Three weeks after Greg O‚ÄôShea became the joint winner of Love Island, his fellow past-pupil Sin√©ad Flanagan was crowned the 2019 Rose of Tralee. She was three years ahead of him in school. It was a great early birthday present for Dr Flanagan who will turn 28 on Thursday. She only qualified as a doctor in May of last year after a circuitous route which involved eight years of study, four as a physiotherapist in the University of Limerick and four more years in University College Cork. She confesses to not knowing her right from her left, but she still managed to win the Dr HH Stewart Medical Scholarship in medical microbiology in UCC in 2016. She is now working as a locum junior doctor in a hospital in Mallow, handy training for the sleep deprivation which comes with being the Rose of Tralee where a round of early interviews are scheduled for the morning after the night before. She has long been a fan of the festival and says she used to cry when the ballad, The Rose of Tralee, was sung after the winner is announced, but was overwhelmed with shock that she couldn‚Äôt cry on Tuesday night after her victory. Once again the bookies were uncannily accurate. She was the bookies‚Äô favourite and her odds were quoted at 74. ‚ÄúPeople had mentioned it in passing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI find it hard to believe that anybody knew us well enough to know what was happening in that sense.‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt looking at our phones.

Dr Flanagan‚Äôs predecessor Kirsten Mate Maher condemned the comments in trenchant terms describing Keogh as an ‚Äúattention-seeker‚Äù who was ignorant of what the festival was really about. Dr Flanagan is slightly more diplomatic. She said the 32 women who were in the live final were a representation of ‚Äúwhat it means to be Irish. It‚Äôs a celebration of family and of friendship. Just speaking for myself, I would like to think I was a modern Irish woman.

Photographer: Mark KauzlarichBloombergA woman who alleges she was a victim of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and claimed she was forced into a sexual encounter with the Duke of York has urged the royal to ‚Äúcome clean‚Äù.Virginia Giuffre was speaking to reporters after a hearing for alleged victims of the disgraced financier and said Prince Andrew, a son of Queen Elizabeth, ‚Äúknows what he‚Äôs done‚Äù.Since Epstein‚Äôs death, there have been a number of reports about his relationship with the duke, including that the pair travelled together on Epstein‚Äôs private jet with teenager Virginia Roberts, now known as Giuffre.Mrs Giuffre has claimed in court papers in Florida that she was forced to have sex with the duke when she was aged 17, under the state‚Äôs age of consent.Her allegations, which the duke denies, were struck from US civil court records in 2015 after a judge said they were ‚Äúimmaterial and impertinent‚Äù.Buckingham Palace has contested reports about the duke‚Äôs links to Epstein, including the private jet flights, over ‚Äúa number of inconsistencies‚Äù.On Tuesday, 16 women who claim they were victims of Epstein spoke at a hearing in New York after a judge offered the accusers the opportunity to give statements about the impact of the alleged offending.‚ÄúHe knows exactly what he‚Äôs done and I hope he comes clean about it,‚Äù Mrs Giuffre said outside court in response to a request for comment about the duke.Andrew released a statement at the weekend expressing ‚Äútremendous sympathy‚Äù for Epstein‚Äôs alleged victims.He also reiterated that it was a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù seeing Epstein (66) after the American‚Äôs release from an 18-month prison term in 2010 for prostituting minors.In the statement, the duke said: ‚ÄúIt is apparent to me since the suicide of Mr Epstein that there has been an immense amount of media speculation about so much in his life.‚ÄúThis is particularly the case in relation to my former association or friendship with Mr Epstein.‚ÄúTherefore I am eager to clarify the facts to avoid further speculation.‚ÄúI met Mr Epstein in 1999. During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year. I have stayed in a number of his residences.‚ÄúAt no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.‚ÄùEpstein was found dead on August 10th in his prison cell in New York, where he was being held on sex trafficking charges.‚ÄìPA "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles¬†then only ¬£2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then ¬£2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018¬†by visiting¬†books.telegraph¬†or call 0844 871 1514.¬†To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to¬†telegraphmattprints¬†or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn writes to the Queen demanding a meeting over suspension of Parliament\u0026#39Constitutional outrage\u0026#39, \u0026#39utterly scandalous\u0026#39, \u0026#39threat to democracy\u0026#39 - how MPs reacted to PM\u0026#39s bid to suspend ParliamentTeenage climate activist Greta Thunberg completes transatlantic crossing on zero-emissions yachtMajor hoard of \u0026#39¬£5m\u0026#39 Norman coins are early example of tax avoidance, British Museum saysThe Great British Bake Off losers\u0026#39 club: how does it feel to leave in week one?Spanish babies develop \u0026#39werewolf syndrome\u0026#39 after alopecia drug sold as reflux syrup in lab mix-up¬†Britain\u0026#39s National Parks need American-style rangers to boost public engagement, says government advisorComment: This isn\u0026#39t a \u0026#39constitutional outrage\u0026#39¬†‚Äì whingeing Remainers need to grow upComment: Boris Johnson is giving Remainers a taste of their own medicine with his Queen\u0026#39s Speech gambitComment: Boris Johnson is gambling that he has left Remainers too little time to stop a no-deal BrexitRead Boris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to MPs on the suspension of ParliamentWhat does it mean to prorogue Parliament, and what is the impact on Brexit?Tourists banned from swimming with famed New Zealand dolphins threatened by \u0026#39too much love\u0026#39¬†The best (and worst) operas on now in the UKLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowBoris Johnson is taking a big gamble by asking the Queen to prorogue Parliament.

It‚Äôs going to be fine.‚Äù¬†He went on to slice his finger three times during filming, requiring large plasters.The weekly showstopper challenge saw contestants asked to create the cake of their childhood dreams, with fairy gardens, toadstool houses, pirate islands and purple carousels from the younger bakers and a ‚Äúretro‚Äù rocket from veteran of the group Phil, 56.¬†Despite their difficulties, the bakers appeared to have impressed the judges.¬†Hollywood said: ‚ÄúEvery year of Bake Off, the standard has got better and better and better, and I expect this year to be just the same.‚ÄùEvicted from the tent was 33-year-old support worker Dan, who said his wife had helped him practice along with his ‚Äúamazing‚Äù parents.¬† ‚ÄúI am not going to miss the baking under pressure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to miss everyone in that tent.‚ÄùThe Great British Bake Off will be on Channel 4 at 8pm on Tuesdays.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The Duke¬†has always denied the allegations and any involvement.¬†Lawyer David Boies, representing several of Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s alleged victims arrives with Annie Farmer, second right, and Virginia GiuffreMrs Roberts-Giuffre was one of several accusers on Tuesday to mention Miss Maxwell by name in an emotionally-charged hearing, held to close the case against Epstein, who died on August 10 from suspected suicide inside a Manhattan jail.Chauntae Davies gave a harrowing account of being recruited by Miss Maxwell, and raped on his US Virgin Island home.‚ÄúI was searching for words but all I could say was ‚Äòno‚Äô,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut that seemed to excite him more.‚ÄúI ran off, my feet bloody from the rocks on the island. I cried myself to sleep that night.‚ÄùAnother Epstein accuser, South African-born Sarah Ransome, told the court that she too was ‚Äúa victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.‚ÄùShe added: ‚ÄúWe all know that he did not act alone. We are all survivors, and the pursuit of justice should not end.‚ÄùMultiple women have filed civil lawsuits against Epstein\u0026#39s estate since his death, saying he abused them and seeking damagesMiss Maxwell, 56, has always denied accusations of any wrongdoing, and has accused Mrs Roberts-Giuffre of lying. Mrs Roberts-Giuffre then sued for slander in a case which was settled in 2017, but whose documents were unsealed last month.Since then the British heiress‚Äôs whereabouts have remained unknown, with her lawyers refusing to respond to The ‚Äôs requests for comment. On August 14 she was reported to have been lying low in a Massachusetts mansion a day later The New York Post published a photo of her ‚Äì the first since 2016 - taken at a Los Angeles burger bar. The paper claimed the photo was taken earlier that week. She has not been seen since.In court on Tuesday, accuser after accuser stepped forwards to tell how Epstein and his associates inflicted immeasurable damage on their lives.Among them was the first British woman to publicly allege abuse by the late financier. Anouska¬†de Georgiou, 42, an actress who was at school with the Duchess of Cambridge, gave a heartfelt speech about the impact of Epstein\u0027s actions.Anouska De Georgiou appeared in the 2004 film Alfie with Jude LawShe said: When I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of a teenager. Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and abused me.He cannot begin to fathom what he did to us. Although I think it is tragic when anyone died before their time, I am extremely relieved he will not be able to hurt any more children.Epstein was known to have travelled to the UK several times, staying at Sandringham as a guest of the Duke of York, and attending, along with the Queen, the duke‚Äôs 40th birthday party in June 2000 at Windsor Castle. Jennifer Araoz, who came forward on July 10 to accuse Epstein of raping her when she was 14, fought back tears to detail the years of torture she has suffered since her attack.‚ÄúThe fact that I will never have the chance to face my predator in court eats away at my soul,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúThis weak, evil coward will never steal our inner strength. And he will never, ever, ever steal our voice.‚ÄùDeath of a financier | Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs final daysMany of Epstein\u0027s accusers agreed with the financier\u0027s legal team that an investigation into his strange death must give answers. Reid Weingarten, Epstein\u0027s lawyer, said that Epstein\u0027s body had been moved before forensic analysis could be carried out, and demanded to know why the prison guards were reportedly refusing to testify about events on the night of his death, and why his team had not been able to view video camera footage from inside the jail.The footage, he said, was corrupted, and he wanted to know how long the system had been malfunctioning.What if the tapes only broke down when he died? Then we are in a whole different territory, he said, saying that the whole case was full of conspiracy theory galore.I think it is the understatement of the year to say the world looks and feels different to when I last stood here, he said. The elephant in the room is what happened to our client.Courtney Wild, whose July 15 testimony helped ensure Epstein was not granted bail, echoed their anger at his untimely death.‚ÄúJeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJeffrey Epstein robbed myself and the other victims of our chance to confront him, one by one. For that he is a coward.‚ÄúI feel very angry and sad. Justice has never been served in this case.‚ÄùJudge Richard Berman, presiding over the court, listened attentively as the women told their stories ‚Äì many of them for the first time.In the front row sat Geoffrey Berman, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose decision to arrest Epstein on July 6 re-opened the case.He was surrounded by a roll call of America‚Äôs most high-powered and influential lawyers ‚Äì among them Al Gore‚Äôs former lawyer David Boies, representing five of the victims Paul Cassell, a former federal prosecutor now working for four accusers and famed women\u0027s¬†rights lawyer Gloria Allred, representing five women, and preparing to speak to several more.Time after time, Epstein was described as ‚Äúsick‚Äù and ‚Äúdepraved‚Äù, a man who resorted to ‚Äúinsidious and pathological violence‚Äù.‚ÄúIn 2004, at the age of 14, I was flown to Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and molested for hours,‚Äù said one accuser, whose anonymous statement was read out by Ms Allred.‚ÄúWhat I remember most vividly was him explaining how beneficial this was to me as he abused me. Especially as he positioned me on the floor, looking at the photos of him smiling with famous people.‚ÄúAfter he finished with me, he wanted me to describe how good my first sexual experience was.‚ÄùBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn writes to the Queen demanding a meeting over suspension of Parliament\u0026#39Constitutional outrage\u0026#39, \u0026#39utterly scandalous\u0026#39, \u0026#39threat to democracy\u0026#39 - how MPs reacted to PM\u0026#39s bid to suspend ParliamentTeenage climate activist Greta Thunberg completes transatlantic crossing on zero-emissions yachtMajor hoard of \u0026#39¬£5m\u0026#39 Norman coins are early example of tax avoidance, British Museum saysThe Great British Bake Off losers\u0026#39 club: how does it feel to leave in week one?Spanish babies develop \u0026#39werewolf syndrome\u0026#39 after alopecia drug sold as reflux syrup in lab mix-up¬†Britain\u0026#39s National Parks need American-style rangers to boost public engagement, says government advisorComment: This isn\u0026#39t a \u0026#39constitutional outrage\u0026#39¬†‚Äì whingeing Remainers need to grow upComment: Boris Johnson is giving Remainers a taste of their own medicine with his Queen\u0026#39s Speech gambitComment: Boris Johnson is gambling that he has left Remainers too little time to stop a no-deal BrexitRead Boris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to MPs on the suspension of ParliamentWhat does it mean to prorogue Parliament, and what is the impact on Brexit?Tourists banned from swimming with famed New Zealand dolphins threatened by \u0026#39too much love\u0026#39¬†The best (and worst) operas on now in the UKLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowBoris Johnson is taking a big gamble by asking the Queen to prorogue Parliament.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the representative\u0026nbspsaid. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.‚ÄúBrexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,‚Äù said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp‚ÄúThe ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.‚ÄùCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Growth in net credit card spending slowed for the third consecutive month. The net amount ‚Äì which is the\u0026nbspdifference between spending and repayments, adjusted for factors\u0026nbspsuch as\u0026nbsppopulation changes and write-offs ‚Äì\u0026nbsprose by ¬£49m, the weakest increase this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the representative\u0026nbspsaid. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.‚ÄúBrexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,‚Äù said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp‚ÄúThe ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.‚ÄùCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. The scientists\u0026nbspfound the gut microbiome of red wine drinkers was more erse compared to those who had drunk other alcoholic drinks.The UK results matched up to three other groups tested in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.Researchers have speculated this is due to\u0026nbsphigher quantities of polyphenol - an organic chemical compound found in the tannins from grapes\u0027 skin which play an essential role making\u0026nbspred wine.They are believed to have\u0026nbspantioxidant properties\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspare also found in fruits, vegetables, chocolate, wine, coffee and tea,\u0026nbspand are thought to contribute to protecting the heart and reducing cancer risks‚ÄúWhile we have long known of the unexplained benefits of\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbspon heart health, this study shows that moderate\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbspconsumption is associated with greater ersity and a healthier gut microbiota that partly explain its long-debated beneficial effects on health,‚Äù Caroline Le Roy, one of the study‚Äôs authors,\u0026nbspsaid.Medical professionals said the negative impact of drinking alcohol should not be ignored, despite the study.‚ÄúNo doctor would recommend drinking on medical grounds, as any potential benefits of red wine polyphenols should be considered\u0026nbspalongside alcohol‚Äôs links to over 200 health conditions, including heart disease and cancers as identified in the Chief Medical Officer‚Äôs guidelines review,‚Äù\u0026nbspSadie Boniface, research co-ordinator at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said.‚ÄúPolyphenols are also available from a range of other foods besides\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine.‚ÄùThe team behind the new study, published in the journal\u0026nbspGastroenterology,\u0026nbspsaid if people wanted to consume alcohol, red wine was the healthiest option.‚ÄúAlthough we observed an association between\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbspconsumption and the gut microbiota ersity, drinking\u0026nbspred\u0026nbspwine\u0026nbsprarely, such as once every two weeks, seems to be enough to observe an effect,‚Äù Ms\u0026nbspLe Roy said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Usually, Apple works over the summer on the next big release, meaning that it is ready in time for the autumn release of the new handsets.But Apple pushed out iOS 13.1 to developers, offering them the option to get their apps ready for the new software. But there is something unprecedented about that decision:\u0026nbspiOS 13 has not even been finished let alone released to the public.The release was initially taken to be a mistake, and some suggested that Apple had simply wrongly numbered the latest versions of iOS 13. But it became clear that it was intentional, and that Apple was planning to allow developers to work on iOS 13.1 even before iOS 13 had arrived.Created with Sketch.

And many experts are suggesting that iOS 13 may simply not be fully ready for the public, forcing Apple to change its release schedule.That could mean that Apple will strip some features out of iOS 13, when it arrives in September and on the new phones. Those features could then be added in again at a later stage, when they are finished and iOS 13.1 is made available to users.Apple would presumably have to admit that those iOS 13 features were not finished and that users will have to wait for later software updates for them to be enabled.Some beta testers of early versions of iOS 13 had already noted that there appeared to be problems with the software. It has been widely reported to include more bugs and problems than previous releases, and early users have expressed concern that it would not be ready in time.That would explain why Apple could be forced to simply admit defeat on attempting to get those updates ready in time, and push them back into a later update.Apple revealed iOS 13 during its Worldwide Developers Conference, its biggest release of the year, in June. It brings a whole new design in the form of a dark mode, as well as a variety of other tweaks and new features that will be added to the software.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On Monday, Wells Fargo published a research note that said a deal could make sense now, in part because Altria has a stake in the vaping company Juul.Philip Morris had a market value of nearly $121 billion at the close of trading in New York on Monday, while Altria was worth about $88 billion.Tobacco giant launches life insurance firm with discount to ex-smokersTobacco giant accused of \u0027staggering hypocrisy\u0027 over stop smoking adsPhilip Morris boss Peter Nixon on taking the smoke out of smokingPhilip Morris wants to stop selling cigarettes, says ad campaignA reunification would combine two of the most popular smoking alternative products: IQOS and Juul. Philip Morris has been ploughing billions of dollars in promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions consumers outside the US. Altria meanwhile has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., which has catapulted itself to the US industry leader in smoking alternatives in just a few years.Altria also has been planning to start selling IQOS in the U.S. this year, testing out demand in the Atlanta area with a store opening next month.Philip Morris said in a statement that no agreement has been formally reached and any deal would be subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval.

It‚Äôs no longer a silly questionLabour will lose seats to Lib Dems unless parties form pact- studyMr Umunna, who quit Labour in February to found The Independent Group only to defect again to the Lib Dems in June, is thought to be highly vulnerable to his former party in the Streatham seat which he has held since 2010.A move to Twickenham, which has been Lib Dem since 1997 apart from the two-year period after the party‚Äôs electoral meltdown in 2015, would be seen as a way to find a more secure home for the party‚Äôs Treasury spokesman.Equally, Dr Wollaston is thought to have little hope of surviving an election in Totnes - an area which has returned Tory MPs since the 1920s - following her defection from the Conservatives to The Independent Group in February and her later move to the Lib Dems in August. The influential Commons Health Committee chair is thought likely to seek another seat before the poll, which must take place by June 2022 but could come as early as this autumn.Sir Vince, 76, has served as MP for Twickenham since 1997, with a two-year break form 2015-17. He regained the seat in 2017 with a\u0026nbsp9,762 majority and a 52.8 per cent share of the vote.He was the party‚Äôs deputy leader under Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg from 2006-10 and was business secretary in the coalition government from 2010-15, when he controversially oversaw the increase in university tuition fees and the sell-off of Royal Mail.He was selected unopposed as party leader in 2017 after the resignation of Tim Farron, and served until July this year, handing over to Jo Swinson at a high point after the Lib Dems‚Äô spectacular results in local and European elections.A Lib Dem spokesperson said: ‚ÄúVince has enjoyed a fantastic parliamentary career in the Liberal Democrats and representing the people of Twickenham.‚ÄúHe will continue to serve as the MP until the next election, whenever that may be.‚ÄùThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences ‚Äî just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find ¬£. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on ¬£,,, Graham Norton is on ¬£, and Claudia Winkleman is on ¬£,.Lineker‚Äôs salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn‚Äôt bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend ¬£million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That‚Äôs more than the annual budget of Radio .It‚Äôs particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners‚Äô TV licences, but can fritter away ¬£million on Facebook adverts There‚Äôs almost nothing Auntie won‚Äôt stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the ‚Äúyoof‚Äù audience.It has earmarked ¬£million to promote its new Sounds app ‚Äî including spending ¬£, to transform the London Eye into the ‚ÄúLondon Ear‚Äù ‚Äî and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ¬≠stories about when sex goes wrong.It‚Äôs all a far cry from Lord Reith‚Äôs mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract ‚Äî and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV‚Äôs Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out ¬£. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay ¬£. for an ‚Äúinternet licence‚Äù to fund Apple‚Äôs iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It‚Äôs time to do away with the licence fee ‚Äî for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions ‚Äî such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than ¬£billion ‚Äî and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.No s, no buts.

The idea that it is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU‚Äôs food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries ‚Äî and in the process do away with the EU‚Äôs protectionist tarfs and product standards ‚Äî some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris‚Äôs vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU.

A senior military spokesman said: A large quantity of components presumably needed to build a ,-tonne sub, which the North has been developing, have turned up recently at a shipyard in Sinpo, South Hamgyong Province.Weve also spotted a floating dock deployed off Sinpo, apparently for a missile test.Satellite imagery taken in March showed cylindrical components. It is speculated they are bulkheads which will be welded together to form the submarines hull.¬†None of the components could be seen from space last year.A South Korean military spokesman said: This suggests that the North has kept building a new sub and testing a submarine-launched ballistic missile.‚ÄùThis means construction has been underway just weeks after the June Singapore summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump and the one in Vietnam last February.The North already has a ,-ton submarine.

Make no mistake about it: what we‚Äôve witnessed today is nothing short of the start of an anti-democratic coup worthy of a tin-pot dictator.The Government, spurred on by Nigel Farage‚Äôs Brexit Party snapping at its heels, have called on the Queen to help them force through a damaging No Deal Brexit.This is dangerous move which could kill the existing relationship between the monarchy and Parliament, requiring the Queen to stay away from political decision-making. That tradition has been upheld for hundreds of years ‚Äì and Boris Johnson has torn it up in the space of a month in pursuit of his political ambitions. But this coup will have other long-term consequences for Brits up and down the country.  ¬† At the last election the majority of parties pledged they would not allow No Deal and in the referendum even the leavers said that No deal was a bad idea. By forcing through a No Deal Brexit, the government will have ignored widespread warnings about food and medicine shortages, NHS ward closures and security risks. It will cost the public billions and usher in a new era of austerity. Because of these dangers and strong evidence that the public does not want a No Deal Brexit, MPs have explicitly voted against a No Deal Brexit on no fewer than three occasions. The Government‚Äôs move to try to suspend Parliament is an attempt to force through No Deal anyway ‚Äì against Parliament and the people‚Äôs will. I therefore call on Parliament and the people to resist this deeply anti-democratic move, using any peaceful means available to them.

That means MPs face a race against time to thwart the Prime Minister taking the UK out of the EU without a Brexit deal on October . Johnson says he wants an opportunity to set up new bills to ‚Äòlevel up‚Äô spending on his priorities, including the NHS, education and policing. But his plan will also dramatically cut down the amount of time MPs have to block Johnson pressing forward with a chaotic no-deal Brexit . Commons Speaker John Bercow has branded it a constitutional outrage. Activists have begun the process of legal action. And Jeremy Corbyn has written to the Queen asking for an urgent meeting, accusing the PM of a smash-and-grab on our democracy. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about Boris Johnson ‚Äôs new plan - and what it means for Brexit.  He‚Äôs setting the date for a Queen‚Äôs Speech and State Opening of Parliament . This effectively reboots Parliament, setting off a new ‚Äòsession‚Äô and shutting down the old one. This process called proroguing usually happens every year - but it doesn‚Äôt have to, and Theresa May chose not to have a Queen‚Äôs Speech in -, so she‚Äôd have more time to push Brexit plans through. That means weaposve now had the longest gap between Queenaposs Speeches for more than  years. To trigger a Queenaposs Speech Parliament has to have a short break, which usually lasts a few days. And when MPs , the slate is clear. Any legislation that was in the process of passing through Parliament is cancelled and MPs start the new session effectively from scratch.  aposProrouguingapos means to suspend a session of Parliament without dissolving it . So ending one session and kicking off a new one with a Queenaposs Speech. Rebooting Parliament. Charles I famously prorogued Parliament and kept it from sitting for  years between  and . That‚Äôs why you may be seeing comparisons to a power-mad king. Thataposs because Parliament is expected to be prorogued on around September - - meaning it will be off for a full month. What is the Queen‚Äôs Speech   It‚Äôs theannual address given by the Monarch to MPs and peers, opening the new session of Parliament. It‚Äôs used by the Prime Minister to outline the Government‚Äôs legislative programme for the upcoming session.  That hasn‚Äôt been fully confirmed, but here‚Äôs the most likely scenario. Parliament is expected tofrom recess on Tuesday September . It‚Äôs then expected to sit until September  or , when it would break up for party conference season. Usually, Parliament wouldstraight away after the end of Conservative Party Conference, which finishes on October . What‚Äôs being suggested is that instead the Queen will end the current session of Parliament on September  or , leaving a longer gap all the way to October .  It massively slashes the amount of time MPs have to pass any kind of blocking measures through Parliament. Let‚Äôs assume the Commons sits Monday to Friday - which it doesn‚Äôt always, but let‚Äôs assume it would in a crunch. If the original timeline were to take place, there would be a maximum of eight sitting days before the conference recess. And assuming they ed the Monday after Tory conference, there would be scope for  sitting days between then and the October  deadline. That‚Äôs  days in which an anti-no-deal coalition could work on ways to block it.  ¬† Now,there‚Äôs a Queen‚Äôs Speech on October , in all likelihood Parliament would stay in recess for the week before. There are usually five full days of debate following a Queen‚Äôs Speech - and another two days of votes on the speech on October -. This would make it exceptionally dficult to schedule any further business in the Commons during that time. So that would leave just seven potential sitting days between conferences and the Brexit deadline - and just  in total. There‚Äôs also the small matter of the European Council meeting on October , which will be the PM‚Äôs last opportunity to seal a new deal with the EU. Boris Johnson this morning said there will be ‚Äúample time‚Äù to debate Brexit before and after the October  meeting.  ¬† Can it be challenged in the courts  Former Prime Minister John Major had already warned he would take High Court action to stop Boris Johnson suspending Parliament to ram through no-deal. Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner, made similar noises. Within hours of the announcement, Remainer QC Jo Maugham said he was initiating legal action to try to stop Boris Johnson.  ¬† Can MPs hold a Parliament anyway  Technically yes, but it wonapost have legal effect. It comes just a day after Jeremy Corbyn and opposition leaders agreed to table a law next week aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit on October . More than  MPs also signed a declaration in Westminsteraposs Church House, vowing to carry on sitting in an alternative venueParliament is suspended. Moments before the Queenaposs Speech emerged, Tory Rory Stewart warned MPs would continue to run Parliament somewhere it was suspended. Labour MP Clive Lewis added: The police will have to remove us from the chamber. We will call on people to take to the streets. We will call an extraordinary session of Parliament.

Kids splashing each other in the sea and locals wearing t-shirts were unheard of here in August  years ago. But now, alongside teenage girls wearing skirts to school and increasing mosquitoes, it is a common occurrence for the residents of Qaanaaq, in north-west Greenland, one of the world‚Äôs most northerly cities situated  miles north of the Arctic Circle. Greenland, the world‚Äôs largest island at almost three times the size of France, is now living with extreme environmental changes which could see the Arctic Sea free of ice by no action is taken.  ¬† I travelled to Greenland, home to just , people, last week to see first hand the drastic changes to conditions and to understand why it matters to us all. Away from headlines about melting ice caps and pictures of underfed polar bears unable to stalk seals on flimsy ice forced to invade towns for food, I found a community battling to adjust. Living alongside a backdrop of eerily beautul icebergs and utterly terrying melting sea ice and retreating glaciers is having a devastating impact on species, habitats and human le. This is the frontline of climate change.  ¬† Three-quarters say they have personally experienced the impact of global warming in their daily lives, from coping with dangerous sea ice journeys to having hunting sled dogs put down for economic reasons due to shorter winters - with many unaware of the full impact. While we may shrug at the decline of traditional hunting, it is impossible to visit Greenland and not be profoundly affected by their tales of how climate change has upturned their world in just a single generation. Families have been torn apart, livelihoods threatened giving us all an insight into the scale of the battle now facing humanity. ‚ÄúIf all of Greenland‚Äôs ice were to melt, it would raise global sea levels by fett meaning cities like London, Sydney and New York underwater and the whole of Bangladesh would disappear,‚Äù says Mark Wright, director of science at WWF, who accompanied the Daily Mirror to the Arctic. ‚ÄúThis is not science fiction. This is the reality of climate change.  ¬† ‚ÄúIt is happening now ‚Äì and here in accelerated terms ‚Äì providing a crucial insight into what we will all face unless urgently tackle this now. Sea ice now forms here two months later and melts one month earlier - as temperatures rise twice as fast as the global average. This summer has seen more than  wildfires in the Arctic Circle devastating once pristine forests, turning them from precious carbon dioxide absorbing sponges into giant new emitters of greenhouse gases. The country is also experiencing record-breaking temperatures. In mid-June, along the eastern coast it was C warmer than the - average. Just as western Europe has baked in a heatwave with record temperatures at the end of July, the hot air moved as far north as Greenland with the gauge hitting C on August . The average high is around C.  Journeys around the coast which took three weeks in the s because of the sea ice now take a single day. Perched beneath the world‚Äôs second largest ice cap after Antarctica, nothing other than black moss and lichen grow here. Fourth fths of Greenland is buried under an ice sheet two miles thick, much of it three million years old. But in the blink of an eye in geological terms it has begun melting ‚Äì and much faster than climate change models predicted. Around % is affected, including higher elevations that only rarely see temperatures climb above freezing. In July alone  billion tonnes of meltwater poured into the Atlantic ‚Äì enough to raise sea levels by .mm. We take a small fishing boat out with Joseph Manumina, , who points to a glacier he used to cross in a five-metre sled pulled by  huskies in the winter.  ¬† But like thousands of others here, the fourth-generation hunter has been forced to abandon his family trade and is now a fisherman. Joseph stops his boat beside the Hiawatha glacier and points out when he was young it stretched hundreds of metres further into the fjord. ‚ÄúThe land you can now see was not visible at all a few years ago. But heavy rains came in  and changed the landscape for good,‚Äù he said. Last year, thanks to signicant melting, scientists discovered a -mile-long crater ‚Äì the first to be found under ice ‚Äì believed to be a direct result of a meteorite impact. While similar melting effects are being measured in the southern hemisphere, the Greenland sheet may be uniquely vulnerable, lying much further from the chill of the pole than Antarctica‚Äôs. Scattered across  small towns and approximately  villages, all situated on a narrow coastal strip, Greenland‚Äôs residents have often been overlooked by data science. But a first-ever national survey has examined the human impact of the climate emergency ‚Äì showing % of islanders interviewed fully accept that the climate crisis is happening. The Greenlandic Perspectives Survey was carried out by the University of Copenhagen‚Äôs Center for Social Data Science, the Kraks Fond Institute for Urban Economic Research and the University of Greenland.  ¬† Lead author Kelton Minor said: ‚ÄúThe Arctic is a bellwether for the unequal impact of global warming on social and economic systems. ‚ÄúAs countries struggle to limit future risks and overall warming to .C many Arctic and Greenlandic residents are already living in regional climates that have changed by more than this, in less than a letime. ‚ÄúTherein lies the paradox: while satellites and sensors monitor the surface of Greenland‚Äôs ice sheet, chase icebergs and scan sea ice daily, relatively little is known about what the residents of Greenland think about their changing surroundings.‚Äù July st was the biggest melt day since at least , when % of sheet experienced melt. Studies found ice melt periods like the one seen seven years ago typically occur about every  years. One occuring so quickly is an important sign how quickly the climate is changing, warn experts. ‚ÄúThis is a double edged sword, says Mark Wright, director of Science at WWF. ‚ÄúWhat we do here in the UK, they way we live our lives by burning fossil fuels, is speeding up the change. ‚ÄúAt the same time this is affecting Greenland and other Arctic countries. But what happens here will also affect what happens at home in terms of our weather patterns and security in coastal areas. ‚ÄúThis is why we have to take action and now. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have long left to cap this rapid change that we‚Äôve never seen before in human history.‚Äù The rapid melting is also opening up new shipping routes and mining opportunities for deposits of rare-earth elements used in technology previously buried under ice sheets hundreds of metres thick.  It has sparked the interest of American President Donald Trump with an attempt to buy it, while China already has a mine on the island. While it is impossible to put a price on the territory, estimates range from . trillion to .trillion depending on the mining potential - believed to be enough to meet % of the world‚Äôs demand in the next  years. Trump may have cancelled his trip to Denmark for now but his suggestion is a marker of the fact Greenland is also now at the heart of a new battle for supremacy in the Arctic, where superpower competition is heating up as fast as the ice is melting.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: ‚ÄúThem were the days.‚ÄúWe thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It‚Äôs a case of careful what you wish for.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get involved in politics now, like I say when didn‚Äôt anyone complain about politicians ‚ÄúCan you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!‚ÄúBut there are some real creeps nowadays.

The highlight is over the period, meeting and playing with some fantastic players.‚ÄùAnd as he prepares to take them to Tannadice on Friday, that‚Äôs a message he‚Äôll be passing on to the squad he‚Äôs in charge of now.‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve said from the start nothing will be won or lost just now, regardless of what happens in the match for either team.‚ÄúThrow in Ayr United, Inverness and forgive meI‚Äôm missing others out but there will be a lot of teams challenging come March, April and into May.

It‚Äôs the nature of football.‚ÄúDown there it was great because we were out the game so it felt like a win because we were - down with  minutes to go away from home.‚ÄúBut,it‚Äôs for a goal,I had to pick one of the two it was the one here.‚ÄùObviously, the injury three-and-half years ago was the low point, though, he is still able to look to the positive long-term outcome.‚ÄúI look on the positive side. If that injury hadn‚Äôt happened I wouldn‚Äôt be leading a team down there this week.‚ÄúI would have continued playing and I would have had some good times and some not so good times going through the later stages of my career.‚ÄúWas it a blessing in disguise  Well I wouldn‚Äôt like to go through that again because it was a horric time for myself and my family but it helped me get a head start in coaching.‚ÄùAs for the injury itself, he admits he knew almost immediately how severe it was.‚ÄúI‚Äôd had bad injuries before but nothing as shocking and as severe as that in terms of the reaction of people around it at the time.‚ÄúI have to say, United were fantastic.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn‚Äôs exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu‚Äôs is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway‚Äôs Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is¬† only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of¬†people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a¬†local¬†group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean‚Äôs goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club‚Äôs social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"heres to ewe gordon","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is¬† only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA -year-old¬† shepherd left the recent Mid Argyll Show with a clutch of prizes for his Texel sheep.Gordon MacLean, from Tarbert, saw off fine specimens of the Texel breed from more experienced sheep men and women to win the ewe lamb class.

The means for¬† protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows. I#ll talk to anyone about this.#But what can ordinary people do Ruth is quite clear. #Get out there and talk to each other, spread the word on social media, speak to politicians.#But most of all support our local farmers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is¬† only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‚ÄòBring a Friend‚Äô evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends ‚Äì and others ‚Äì to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils‚Äô box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils‚Äô advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr‚Äôs low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils‚Äô sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts‚Äô keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair‚Äôs first visit to the Wee Toon.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-crocodile-rock-oran-mor-glasgow-four-stars","story":"Crocodile RockOran Mor, GlasgowMary Brennanfour starsA Play, a Pie and a Pint is still in the mood to celebrate  productions since its inception, so some previous successes are in the autumn roster alongside new scripts.

This poses a problem for many on the left who think politics isnt about achieving national sovereignty, but promoting social justice. They struggle to deal with it, and find a coherent vision of how to reconcile peoples need for identity and the demands of economic opportunity and social justice.Brexit has upset the UKrsquos constitutional applecart, and this English nationalist project has encouraged Scottish nationalism. Both projects seek to break up multinational unions in the name of sovereignty. Brexit has already split the UK down the middle, and similar vote in some future Scottish referendum would create a fissure in Scottish society that would last generations. We need something better.Whatever happens with Brexit, there is an alternative for the UK. The risks to economic opportunity and social justice presented by independence stem not from acknowledging Scottish identity, nor from increasing Scottish autonomy, but from breaking the economic and social bonds of the United Kingdom. Its domestic market is vital for Scotlands economy, and sharing resources across the UK supports social justice in Scotland through welfare and public spending programmes, as we saw again last week the latest GERS figures.We do not have to lose these benefits in order to gain more autonomy. Instead, Scotland, and the rest of the UK, should move to a more federal system. The structures of federalism, which means dferent levels of government each with their own responsibilities, can support dferent social models, but I argue for a progressive form of federalism, one designed to create the maximum scope for social justice in each part of the country. Here is what it would mean for Scotland.First of all, it implies a change of mindset in the whole UK, from the worn-out notions of parliamentary sovereignty which drive so much of our overcentralised government, especially in England, to an understanding that the UK really is a multinational state, a voluntary association of nations which come together to preserve their identities and promote their shared interests. That implies a better form of entrenchment for devolution in the UK constitution. Given the circumstances of Brexit, it means entrenching wider powers too.More important, perhaps, it implies a design which embeds the purpose of social justice in the territorial constitution. The federal UK parliament and government should be responsible for providing a guaranteed level of welfare and public service provision across the whole territory, irrespective of whether local taxable resources are big enough to support it, much as today.But government in the devolved nations should have the capacity to increase this from their own resourcesthey think it necessary. Thatrsquos an each-way bet for social justice.Wersquore already close to that for Scotland today. Not only is the Scottish Parliament responsible for most major public services, but it can supplement any welfare benefit it thinks unjustly small. It has the money too: not only is the devolved budget about  per cent per head higher than English levels, Holyrood has wide tax powers too.A UK which followed these principles would make a similar offer to the dferent regions of England. Many of those who voted Leave in the European referendum were expressing a beef with London, not Brussels: thats where they need to take back control from.Those obsessed with sovereignty and identity see nationalism as an end in itself. History tells us this is a dangerous road. But those who want to promote social justice and co-operation between dferent peoples cannot ignore the human need for acknowledgement of their identity. For them the right approach is a model of progressive federalism, empowering the UKrsquos nations and regions in a way which gives each level of government the power to promote a just society.This will be one of the themes explored by the new Think Tank Our Scottish Future being launched with an address by former PM Gordon Brown in Edinburgh this week."},{"url":null,"title":"four-go-trial-accused-trafficking-women-glasgow","story":"Three men and a woman are alleged to have brought more than a dozen women from Slovakia and held them in ldquoslavery or servitude.

Yet even those people, who previously promised to implement the referendum result, thenstood on a manesto promising to implement the result, then, by one of the biggest Commons vote ever, voted to implement Article , specying ldquono deal as the default, balked at putting Mr Corbyn in power as the price of stopping any hard exit.Itrsquos dficult to see how legislation guarantees the prevention of no deal, though. Itrsquos an illogical position, when no deal is the default, and when any restrictions wouldnrsquot be binding on the PM, nor even necessarily within his gt .It is, however, no more bonkers than the Brexit Partyrsquos insistence that only a no deal Brexit is real Brexit ndash a stance no doubt inspired by government failure to deliver, but one that no one was advocating three years ago.Mr Corbyn, unlike the other party leaders, mentioned the continued possibility of a vote of no confidence. As Leader of the Opposition, hersquos best-placed to table one, but that is the extent of his advantage. Assumingit were won, the Labour leader would then have to demonstrate he had the necessary support to form a government, which means about  votes: ie, persuading some  non-Labour MPs to vote for him.The prospect of Tories, even those practically demented by the idea of no deal, backing that is nil. The Lib Dems have ruled it out. It would be a huge strategic error for the SNP. And thatrsquos before you take into consideration the fact that there could well be about  of Mr Corbynrsquos own MPs who wouldnrsquot vote for it.Mr Corbyn, despite not banging on about it in his meeting, is still apparently insisting that a vote would mean him becoming prime minister .I think a GNU would be undemocratic, undesirable and unlikely. But in a fantasy world where the proposed interim PM were Ken Clarke, or Harriet Harman, itrsquos just about possible. But you would need a vote of no confidence first. So the person best placed to bring it about is Jeremy Corbyn, and the biggest obstacle to it happening is Jeremy Corbyn.Small wonder the other leaders preferred to make it a last resort, trying instead to rule out no deal by legislation. The problem is that you canrsquot, with absolute certainty, for both practical and political reasons. Practically, because MPs have to vote for something, anything  to avoid what is otherwise the default position, and so far they canrsquot agree on what that would be. Eventhey could, therersquos no guarantee itrsquos anything thatrsquos on offer.:Will SNP efforts to unseat Lib Dems be enough for Shetland by-election victoryAnd while the no deal absolutists are as deluded as the revoke extremists, there are potential deals ndash and the one negotiated by Theresa May is one ndash clearly even worse than no deal. Thatrsquos why MPs voted it down three times.Politically, this approach is tricky because, while Boris Johnson says he would still rather have a deal, he is totally committed to exit by October . Just as his mind wonrsquot be changed by a vote saying MPs wonrsquot accept no deal, nor will such a vote magic away the fact that itrsquos the legal default. His opponents would also have to commit to some positive course of action to replace it: either the blatantly anti-democratic nuclear option of outright revocation, or acceptance of some deal that is actually on offer at the time. Or an election.By contrast, the PM has nothing to lose by calling an election. Therersquos a sporting chance he could win itwersquove left the EU, or would do so during the campaign, or at oncehe won. Therersquos the near-certainty that the Brexit Party would prevent him winninghe were to show the slightest sign of backing down on the date.This is now a game of chicken where everyone ndash Johnson, Corbyn, Remainers, Brexit absolutists, and the EU ndash believes that their only chance of getting what they want is not to blink.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‚Äòkeeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‚Äòkeeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‚ÄòA‚Äô League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‚ÄòA‚Äô League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus ‚Äî standing in for the injured Owen Rendall ‚Äî paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‚ÄòA‚Äô League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He is being represented by Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.BBC Radio Shetland#s John Johnston is hosting the event, with all eight candidates being given a minute to introduce themselves and their policies before moving on to audience questions.Independent candidate Ian Scott provided an impassioned speech, saying that he has¬†#stood specically steadfastly against the cuts, the Tories, the Liberal Democrats‚Äù before. He also reacted angrily to the news that Mr Goodlad could not be in attendance, shaking his head as Mr Halcro Johnston explained his absence.SNP candidate Tom Wills began by saying that #Shetland is ready for a change# and asked for  months to show what he can achieve in Holyrood, while Lib Dem competitor Beatrice Wishart opened her speech with a defiant message: #If you want an MSP who will speak up for Shetland, I‚Äôm your woman#.The first question of the night revolved around transport, with Ms Wishart and Mr Wills clashing immediately, interrupting each other#s answers as Mr Johnston appealed for both candidates to let the other finish.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to Mr Wills# five-point transport plan by saying that #Tom Wills¬†has a load of great ideas but they won‚Äôt be delivered#, while independent candidate Ryan Thomson added that #nothing gets done‚Äù because ‚ÄúShetland is the pawn‚Äù in mainland politics.Councillor George Smith directed a question at Mr Wills, asking him how he expected the SIC to afford one of his election pledges, free foot passengers on inter-island ferries.Mr Wills responded to say that this could be paid for #, and when# the Scottish government provided additional funding to the council.Mr Thomson criticised the NorthLink ferries in response to a question about increased capacity on the ferries. He focused his attack on the much-maligned sleeping pods, not for the first time, saying that we had been #lumbered# with these pods and said he was reticent to even call them pods, instead saying #it#s a chair#.#Bigger ships# and #daytime sailings# were potential solutions that Mr Thomson suggested as alternatives.On the subject of Brexit, only Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that he was in favour of Brexit, although he admitted that he voted to remain in the EU.Mr Scott and Mr Wills attacked the coalition of the Tories and the Lib Dems, with Mr Scott saying that the #Tories and Liberals approved austerity and that they had¬†#turned to the racists and the fascists# which garnered wide applause.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to say it was #always very amusing listening to Ian but I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs wrong#, which was met negatively by the audience.Mr Wills said that the SNP #could stop Brexit#, and added thatthey were pulled out of the EU by Westminster then a vote for independence could put Scotland back into the European Union.He expanded on Mr Scott#s point by saying the #reason why people voted for Brexit is because of the coalition of Lib Dems and Tories which approved austerity# to a rapturous reception. Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be ¬£. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about ¬£ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some ¬£ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about ¬£ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of ¬£. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron‚Äôs government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.Had it not been for the global economic crisis, and Blair#s US led wars, Brown#s finances could have seen him becoming PM. This shows the harm in getting too friendly with the US, not that there will be much of a choice for the remnants of the UK after Brexit. I won#t digny John M Scott#s final comment with a response other than to note that it is Trump and Farage that have been too close to white supremacists. Happily neither seem that popular north of the boarder. The SNP promote an inclusive civic nationalism which can#t seriously be compared to that of the far right.##and the peril of getting too friendly with the EU is being dictated to and bled dry by a Union of Socialist Republics ruled by a Germanic Franco dictator, aided an abetted by a random collection of Belgians.Best off going it alone and not being shackled up to some #superpower#, either actual or wannabe.John M Scott#s remark reminds me of something a reviewer wrote in the Shetland News in : #The depths of ignorance are surely plumbed here#.It#s like I wasnt even there.No mention of Labours position on Brexit or Independence. Thanks guysYou#ll have to listen tonight folks, there isnt even any mention of VE which was discussedLabour has a position on Brexit!Where did you find out about this Johan @Brian Hill, It is you who fantasise, not I. I did not mention #national debt#. So let#s set aside the #smoke and mirrors#. I am talking about the ¬£. billion gap between Scottish tax revenue raised last year and money received from Westminster. We have been running similar, sometimes larger deficits for many years. Unless something changes this will become our annual budget deficit on obtaining independence as Westminster will no longer fund the shortfall.Don#t take it from me. A couple of years back, the SNP#s own Sustainable Growth Commission conceded that we would start independence with a budget deficit of .% of our GDP, around ¬£. billion per year, and proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to less than %, which just happens to be the EU#s maximum permissible limit. @Brian Hill, Ok,we are to be pernickety:The UK funds the dference between our tax revenues and what Holyrood receives from the Exchequer so we are talking about a so-called #notional deficit# that has been ongoing for many years.This is recognised by the SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission.UK funding will cease on Independence Day and the notional deficit will become , our budget deficit.The current UK funding of ¬£. billion equates to around ¬£ per head of population, per year. With independence that money will have to be found where # borrowing or tax hikes # or cut from public services.#John, as Scotland is not yet independent then it cant have been running a deficit for any#, what utter nonsense. Since when did you have to be independent to go broke  Try telling that one to your bank manager. Dr Craig Dalzell! who  wings over Scotland! still based in England, hard to make it up but you manage it Brian.John, I#m sorryit appeared pernickety, but my fundamental point was that you cant predict the future finances of any putative future independent Scotland based on the notionalaccounts of a devolved Scotland within the current UK state. No amount of repetition of thosefigures alters the arguments.Brian,You#re putting words in my mouth. I#m not attempting to predict future finances. Merely, observing that we would start from a very bad place, losing the ¬£. billion annual UK funding.But please, don#t take it from me.The SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission propose a multi-year programme of deficit reduction and Oxford University Professor Gallacher has studied the most recent figures. He concludes: #Any more realistic look‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. starting from Scotland‚Äôs actual fiscal position, swtly shows‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.would quickly amass unsustainable levels of debt, and the cost of servicing it would require large cuts in public services. #‚Ä¶.today‚Äôs relatively high spending is supported by large UK fiscal transfers, and to avoid cutting it large borrowing would be needed. #That swtly adds up to very large debt, which cannot be afforded. #All this strategy would achieve is to delay the inevitable big cuts in spending until Scotland is heavily indebted and so has to make even more cuts.#Paraphrasing your own words, Brian, #No amount of SNP preication can alter the facts.#.."},{"url":null,"title":"electoral showdown draws closer ","story":"Preparations are well in advance for this week#s by-election, with council staff readying the floor for Thursday#s electoral showdown.In all,  staff, including presiding officers, polling clerks and information officials will be on hand during this week#s vote.Twenty-eight polling places are being opened, containing a total of  polling stations.The Gilbertson Park Games Hall in Lerwick will have seven polling stations set up for , voters.In contrast, the Uyeasound hall in Unst will open its doors to  voters.Over  voters could walk through the doors of the Scalloway hall to cast their vote.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic ‚Äì those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range ‚Äì by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: ‚ÄúThere is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. ‚ÄúSeveral of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. ‚ÄúI was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . ‚ÄúAs a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn‚Äôt a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. ‚ÄúI am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.‚ÄúI have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre running a busy house and looking after everyone  it‚Äôs easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. ‚ÄúI decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.‚ÄúI realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS‚ÄúMy blood sugar levels were border-line they weren‚Äôt going down but they weren‚Äôt going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. ‚ÄúIt was my daughter‚Äôs birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. ‚ÄúShe said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let‚Äôs just say it wasn‚Äôt quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. ‚ÄúNeedless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‚Äòpre-diabetic‚Äô band.‚ÄúPrior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.‚ÄúThe class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. ‚ÄúEach week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.‚ÄúI used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I‚Äôm walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM‚ÄúOne day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I‚Äôm trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I‚Äôll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I‚Äôve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. ‚ÄúThe Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.‚ÄùThelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice‚Äôs diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: ‚ÄúWhen I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That‚Äôs how quickly the disease is on the rise. ‚ÄúOften patients don‚Äôt realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‚ÄòI just have a touch of diabetes‚Äô or ‚ÄòI only have diabetes‚Äô, but it‚Äôs a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.‚ÄúPatients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it‚Äôs only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.‚ÄúHaving diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people‚Äôs drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.‚ÄúFor some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. ‚ÄúFor others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That‚Äôs who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.‚ÄúOnce higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it‚Äôs not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. ‚ÄúThe longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. ‚ÄúInsulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren‚Äôt sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.‚ÄúI was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme‚Äôs viability in my area. I‚Äôm a big supporter. ‚ÄúSo far I‚Äôve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. ‚ÄúOften I‚Äôve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that‚Äôs not the case, it‚Äôs just healthy eating, it‚Äôs the way we should all be eating.‚ÄúAs far as the success of the programme goes, it‚Äôs a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.‚ÄúSo, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don‚Äôt want to let your group members down. ‚ÄúThat shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. ‚ÄúThat can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do‚Äù.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic ‚Äì those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range ‚Äì by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‚ÄòDiabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

With over thirty years experience in the field, he has been the head chef, first manager and then owner of the popular The Side Door restaurant, located at Febro Buildings on the Antrim Road in Glengormley for  years.Brendan grew up on the Cltonville Road until he was  years old when his parents moved to the Antrim Road. His first part-time job came in the old Lansdowne Court as it was known back in the day.Ever since a young age, Brendan was interested in the food and catering industry and decided to pursue a career in the field when he left school at . After three years at the College of Business in Brunswick Street in Belfast, he went on to complete a B-Tech qualication and an advanced catering course.Subsequent employment followed in the shape of a full-time role in the Lansdowne before spells in Belfast Castle, the Crawfordsburn Inn and Chimney Corner.But it is with his current venture The Side Door that he has made his name, establishing the -seater restaurant ever since taking over six years ago as the new owner.Brendan explained: ‚ÄúThe Side Door is basically a family-style restaurant with something on the menu for everyone. The menu is very mainstream.‚ÄúThe previous owner‚Äôs menu was something close to fine dining but people were still ordering pizzas. I thought it wasn‚Äôt right so I changed the menu about a bit.‚ÄúI had my own ideas and kept it mainstream to attract anybody and everybody.‚ÄúThe pressure was there to get bums on seats and it has worked ever since so I have no intention of changing it.‚ÄùBrendan also acts as Head Chef at The Side Door and thanks to his wealth of experience, he has put his own style and spin on food.‚ÄúI would cook things like lasagne, carbonara, scampi and burgers,‚Äù he added.‚ÄúEverything is home-made. I am experienced enough to know what way things are cooked best and what sells well.‚ÄúI used to be a sauce chef and I suppose sauces and soups are still my forte.It is still probably my favourite aspect of being in the kitchen.‚ÄúI was brought up in the catering industry on a French theme which is something I still like doing, especially with some of the specials in the restaurant in some shape or form.‚ÄùAs for how things have changed in the industry, Brendan points to a number of ious things he has noticed over the years.‚ÄúThe food industry has changed massively over the years,‚Äù he explained.‚ÄúThemes and customers needs and wants are like night and day now since when I started off over  years ago.‚ÄúFood takes waves now, much like politics. whether Italian or Mexican themed.‚ÄúThere are more vegans and vegetarians than ever before but allergies is such a big thing these days. Celiac is definitely the main one and you just have to be so careful.‚ÄúI probably wouldn‚Äôt have taken as much of an interest in allergies but when I found out my daughter had a nut allergy, it changed everything. It scared me.‚ÄùLooking ahead to the future, Brendan reflected on what he has achieved so far at The Side Door.‚ÄúGlengormley is a perfect setting. People thought I was mad taking The Side Door on with the amount of competition but my idea wasyou want to buy a washing machine and there is more than one shop available in the same area to buy it, you will still compare it, just like restaurants.‚ÄúI think we stand out because we are not pretentious. Many restaurants are, in my opinion. We are not ‚Äì what you see is what you get: fresh food bought from a number of dferent suppliers who I have built up a relationship with over the years. I buy the best produce that I can get but at affordable prices for customers.‚ÄúI believe also in good service and to my knowledge, we are still the only bring-your-own restaurant in Glengormley.‚ÄúAs for the future, I am not getting any younger. I thought around two years ago about looking for a bigger premises. What I have to turn away from a Thursday to a Sunday now is scary some weeks, but I thought here was working. I decided to stay because things are good and long may it continue.‚ÄúCustomers keep coming back so I must be doing something right.‚ÄùBrendan Rafferty is Owner, Manager and Head Chef at The Side Door restaurant in Glengormley.The Side Door,Febro Buildings,Ballyclare Road,Glengormley,BT DZ.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"speckled hen have got it well sussed","story":"IN a food market dominated by commercial farming, big drinks brands and unormity, the authenticity and quality yielded by do-it yourself approach is becoming all the more appealing, and there are few businesses doing it better locally than the Speckled Hen Bar and Dining Rooms.Having long brewed an exciting range of its own craft beers and ciders, the Lisburn-based establishment has taken the next crucial step towards self-suffiency by bottling its own still and sparkled water. Although a seemingly simple step, tapping into the natural springs below the bar has revealed interesting information about the geography of the area and, as owner Martin Caldwell explains, has created further links to the Speckled Hen‚Äôs -year history.‚ÄúRight under our feet is the Triassic Aquer, which stretches from the Castlereagh to Black Mountain,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThere has always been a well under the bar, so given that we‚Äôre filtering our own water anyway, it made sense to put in a chiller, a cooler and a carbonator to make fizzy water too.‚ÄúThere was originally a well there and the previous owner had tapped into it. During the winter time you can actually see little springs coming up out in the carpark. There used to be a well where our beer garden is now where they used to dip the buckets for water. The pub goes back to , so it goes back a fair while. They used to brew their own beers and everything here, so access to spring water was vital.‚ÄùHe continued: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fantastic that a place of this age is still ing and providing hospitality and services. This used to be the old post road and was also one of the main roads to Dublin at the time, so coaches used to stop along here. It was actually alleged that Daniel O‚ÄôConnell stopped here before. It would have had to have been self-sufficient. We‚Äôre essentially going back to the notion of our own self-sufficiency in terms of the supply of water as well.‚ÄùThe Speckled Hen started bottling its water last month, installing a new filtration system that provides fresh four-times-filtered water for its customers. The water is, of course, filtered through the rocks on its journey across the mountains that, according to Queen‚Äôs University researchers, began , to , years ago. As for the punters, Martin says they see it as a ‚Äúgreat novelty‚Äù.‚ÄúThey‚Äôre getting their draft beer and now they are getting draft water, he said.‚ÄúThe kids come in and want cordials or juices, so now well ask themthey want still or fizzy water ‚Äì they think it‚Äôs a great novelty getting the fizzy water in the cordial.‚ÄùWhile making connections with the pub‚Äôs past, Martin and his team are also looking to the future with the installation of farming allotments that will provide fruit, veg and more for it‚Äôs kitchens in the years to come."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37264874.ece/36493/BINARY/primarknew010.jpg","title":"chamber chief hails creative thinking shown following belfast primark inferno","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It led to many months of disrupted business for retailers and shoppers in the area after a cordon was put in place around the unsafe building. \"We all really felt it,\" he said.Read MoreClaire McNeilly: Why do we still not know how Belfast Primark fire started In October alone footfall was down % on the year before. Fast food restaurant City Picnic closed on the day of the fire and hasnt been opened since, though hopes to be open again by the autumn. Others such as Pizza Boutique struggled on for a time after the cordon was reduced, only to also shutter their premises completely.Primark opened two stores, one at the back of its Bank Buildings shop and another on Donegall Place - though it is also planning a restoration of Bank Buildings. Fashion chain Zara was closed for around seven months, thanks to its close proximity to Bank Buildings.Mr Rana said the first impact had been to galvanise organisations in the city to work together with a greater sense of urgency than ever before. \"There was Belfast City Council, then ourselves in the Chamber, then the other business-type organisations like Belfast City Centre Management and also the Department for Communities, and Translink.\"It did throw us together and resulted in a great deal of co-ordination and co-working. Its probably strengthened that relationship and added impetus to work together.\"That led to initiatives to draw people into the city centre around Christmas, such as a winter-themed slide in Royal Avenue and stalls selling fast food. And a kids play park was also installed in Castle Place.Mr Rana said: \"The animation that the council provided in the peak Christmas season meant the city was very busy, and that did attract people into the city that probably hadnt been in recently. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  Aerial view over Bank Buildings following Tuesdays fire.

Discussions are taking place, too, about pedestrianisation and improving public transport into and around the city. Mr Rana - whose company Andras House owns a string of hotels in the city - said the crisis of the fire had led to creative thinking. \"I would say it did stimulate new ideas to try things, which dont always work but its good to try them. \"It certainly has highlighted the importance of the city centre. When it wasnt ing we all really felt it.\"He said retail was the biggest pull into the city centre, but that the night-time economy and the drive to get more people living in it were also a big part of planning its future.

The current session, which started on June ,  with the last State Opening and Queen‚Äôs Speech, has been the longest in history.‚Äì Who does it The Queen formally prorogues Parliament following guidance from the Privy Council,¬† which¬†is her body of advisers made up mainly of senior politicians.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  ‚Äì Why does Boris Johnson want to prorogue Parliament now A new Government brings with it new plans and legislation which are set out in a Queen‚Äôs Speech. Mr Johnson insists he has asked the Queen to bring about the end of the current session of Parliament so he can start anew.‚Äì What happens during prorogation While Parliament is prorogued, MPs and peers cannot formally debate policy and legislation or make any laws of their own.Parliamentary scrutiny is suspended and the powers of the Houses of Commons and Lords are effectively taken away until the next Queen‚Äôs Speech.‚Äì How long will Parliament be prorogued for Prorogation normally tends to be for a short amount of time ‚Äì no longer than two weeks, with it leading to either a general election or the start of a new Parliamentary session.Under the new plan, Parliament is set to be dissolved in the second week of its September sitting, possibly as early as Tuesday September , with MPs due tofor the Queen‚Äôs Speech on October .Parliament had been due to break for its conference recess for at least two weeks in the lead up to October, even before the news of the prorogation broke, with Number  arguing that MPs are only losing an extra four sitting days in total.‚Äì So why has the move sparked such anger There have been fears for a number of months that, should the Government not be able to strike an exit deal with the European Union, the Prime Minister could look to prorogue Parliament to prevent MPs from attempting to stop the UK leaving without a deal.Critics believe this is what he is doing now. Senior opposition figures and Tory opponents of a no-deal Brexit met on Tuesday to draw up plans to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement. A day later the PM has effectively moved to curtail their time to draw-up legislation that would prevent Britain from exiting without a Withdrawal Agreement signed-off.‚Äì So could a snap general election still be on the cards Commentators saw the surprise announcement that¬†Chancellor Sajid Javid will set out Whitehall spending budgets next week as a sign that the new administration was ramping up plans for an early election.But inviting the monarch to Parliament for the pomp and ceremony of the Queen‚Äôs Speech on October  would be an odd thing to dothe PM is actually planning a snap election.However,opposition and rebel Tory MPs unite behind a no-confidence motion against the Government in retaliation against the plans to prorogue, that could force Parliament into a stalemate where a general election is the only resolution."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon accuses pm of acting like dictator on dark day for democracy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery‚Äôs closure but did not respond at the time of going to press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"new cain documents highlight unresolved political issues","story":"A new batch of documents added to Ulster University‚Äôs CAIN archive demonstrate how important issues affecting Northern Irish politics twenty years ago remain pertinent today.The newly released material provides a valuable insight into the period between -, mostly notably in relation to the Brooke Mayhew talks.In addition, it also charts developments in Anglo-Irish relations for these years, ongoing discussions around ious political and security matters, as well as important issues such as fair employment, the Irish language and community relations.The Brooke Mayhew negotiations took place to secure ‚Äúa new, more broadly based agreement‚Äù which would replace the Anglo Irish Agreement.On the  March, , the first roundtable negotiations, excluding Sinn Fein, took place in an attempt to end the political stalemate in N.I., and continued through to November .Although they appeared to achieve little the Brooke Mayhew talks were the first to have \"three strands\", the relationships within Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between London and Dublin. A basis had been laid for future discussions.The CAIN website, whose workers are based at the Magee campus in Derry, provides an extensive range of information and source material on the conflict and politics from  to the present day.The site is used by a worldwide audience and has received more than  million visits since it was launched in March .Earlier this year, the Derry News revealed that it was under threat of closure but thanks to a staunch defence of the site mounted by academics and researchers, Ulster University announced a nine-month reprieve while funding options are explored.Around  documents relating to the years  and  have been added to the CAIN website as part of ongoing work involving the Ulster University and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland .The latest additions will bring to more than , the number of PRONI records available on CAIN.Dr Brendan Lynn, CAIN Deputy Director, said the archive is delighted to have been able to continue its cooperation with PRONI and to update the existing section with material dealing with the years  and .Mr Lynn commented: ‚ÄúCAIN has always sought to work with and iniduals, groups and organisations with relevant information relating to the Northern Ireland ‚Äòtroubles‚Äô in order to make it available on-line.‚ÄúAn obvious example of this has been the partnership that CAIN has developed with The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland . As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI‚Äôs many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.‚ÄúThe development of ‚ÄòPRONI Records on CAIN‚Äô therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .‚ÄúLooking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‚Äòpeace process‚Äô of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .‚Äù‚ÄòPolitical stalemate‚ÄôIn terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.‚ÄúFor instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions ‚Äì often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -. Whilst these were ultimately to end in failure they did leave behind an important template that was to be used at a later date,‚Äù Mr Lynn added.Dr Michael Willis, PRONI Director, has welcomed the publication of previously secret records through a continuing partnership between PRONI and Conflict Archive on the INternet .He said: ‚ÄúPRONI‚Äôs mission is to identy, preserve and promote public access to Northern Ireland‚Äôs archival heritage.‚ÄúThis latest addition of official documents to the CAIN website enhances the opportunity to view and read key documents from the time.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick. This despicable act was not done in our name and we condemn those responsible.ldquoWe are not prepared to let those responsible have a negative impact on the good people, from all religions and races, who live at this part of Downpatrick.

We trust that our community collective colleagues will recognise that the sentiments expressed in the recent graffiti is not what we are about.ldquoWe work with people from across the town and liaise closely with them on a regular basis. We are vey much a mixed community and indeed are proud of this fact. The graffiti daubed on the wall of Down High School in no way reflects the people of this area.The spokesperson said residents were left ldquoshocked and upset by what was written and were in the process of taking steps to have it removed when a local businessman stepped forward to do it.ldquoWe have a fair idea who was responsible for the graffiti and hope that they will be apprehended. We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter. Those responsible are clearly not aware of what we are about and the respect we have for all our neighbours across Downpatrick.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe will not allow what happened to drive a wedge between us and others. If those responsible hoped the finger of blame would be pointed at us, they have failed. Like many others, we were left disgusted at what happened.Downpatrick councillor, John Trainor, said those responsible for the sectarian graffiti did not speak for the majority of local people, in particular, those who live in the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.Slamming the slogan as a ldquoshameful act, Cllr Trainor described Downpatrick as a ldquowelcoming place where respect is shown to all residents irregardless of creed, culture, religion or race. He said what happened last week does not reflect the town and its people and was in fact a hate crime.ldquoThose responsible do not speak for the majority of people here, declared Cllr Trainor. ldquoThere are many families who were impacted by the troubles, including some by collusion with the security forces, and this does not help to heal those wounds which are still very fresh.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoI condemn this act and all graffiti that is sectarian in nature which seeks to cause offence and hurt to a particular section of our community.Police investigating last weekrsquos incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to come forward, using the non-emergency  number.

Their unique wing structure along with their light weight enables them to go to places that other land-based mammals would find unmanageable. Their limbs are highly modied for flight, so they find it dficult to move around on the ground. When they are not flying, they rest hanging upside down from a tree branch using their sharp claws.Roosting in caves, trees or draught-free buildings each species has their own preferred roost, usually near its main food source. They eat insects including moths and midges, so are considered a very important natural pest controller. Echolocation aids their navigation when hunting for prey on the wing at night. Bats are creatures of habit, ing to their favourite roost each year..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Northern Ireland has eight species of bats, all protected by European law. Apart from being incredible little animals to watch, bats are a valuable part of nature across the UK and can be a very welcome visitor to our gardens. Sadly, though, they‚Äôre becoming increasingly rare in the UK. Like so many other animals, a gradual loss of habitat and roost sites are making numbers decline at an alarming rate. As old trees are cut down, buildings disturbed and mines filled in, bats are left with very few natural roost sites. Making sure our gardens are thriving insect-rich feeding grounds for bats can help a lot. And, just as we do with nestboxes for birds, we can also provide alternative roost sites for bats in the form of bat boxes. You can find out more information on how to help bats via our website . So while our Belfast Bat Walk is done for another year, we have another fantastic event taking place in Enniskillen in September. What better date for a ‚ÄòBat Detectives‚Äô guided walk than Friday the th  It‚Äôs a great opportunity to learn more about bats, to see and hear them and immerse yourself in their world. There will be a short introductory talk about bats followed by a night-time walk using bat detectors to identy the dferent species living in Enniskillen town centre. Tickets are ¬£ per adult, ¬£. per child and free for all RSPB members.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region‚Äôs longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to ¬£.bn from ¬£.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to ¬£.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to ¬£.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently ¬£.bn, up from ¬£.bn previously ‚Äì snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects ‚Äì Graham posted annual sales of ¬£.m in its latest financial accounts up from ¬£.m ‚Äì an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‚Äòs sales decreased from ¬£m to ¬£.m ‚Äì this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of ¬£.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of ¬£.m. Last year‚Äôs number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of ¬£.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ‚Äôs inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at ¬£.m compared to ¬£.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of ¬£.m on a turnover of ¬£.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of ¬£m against a turnover of ¬£.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of ¬£.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of ¬£.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of ¬£.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of ¬£m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of ¬£m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to ¬£.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company‚Äôs total tangible assets minus the company‚Äôs total liabilities. A business‚Äôs tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at ¬£.bn ‚Äì as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by ¬£m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to ..

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models ‚Äì and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It‚Äôs an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it‚Äôs targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland‚Äôs leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him ‚Äì growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available ‚Äì including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis ‚Äì looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. ‚ÄúThat allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we discovered it wasn‚Äôt just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.‚Äù That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren‚Äôt initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst‚Äôs Springboard programme in  ‚Äì a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL‚Äôs Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme ‚Äì bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed ¬£, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area ‚Äì the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD‚Äôs chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. ‚ÄúThe Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It‚Äôs a great networking opportunity,‚Äù Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. ‚ÄúWhat we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBiomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. ‚ÄúThat allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.‚Äù That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. ‚ÄúWhen the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,‚Äù Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic ‚Äì helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. ‚ÄúIn the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,‚Äù Katie said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a lot of growth in the US.‚Äù And the axialD team is also growing fast. ‚ÄúWe have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,‚Äù Daniel said. ‚ÄúThat includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.‚Äù The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It‚Äôs an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites ‚Äì including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
