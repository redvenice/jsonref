But albino rabbits don’t like harsh climates. They didn’t last the winter’My father is a Tibetan lama. When he was still just a baby, he was recognised as a tulku, a reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist teacher. He lives in the UK now. He met my mother in Dalhousie, India, when she was teaching English to Tibetan refugees. They fell in love and he gave up his monastic vows, but being a tulku isn’t something you can give up. It is who you are.He is still the head of a monastery in Kham, Qinghai, so when we are there, it’s a busy time – we get invited to a lot of houses. I was seven the first time I went. As an adult, I started going back regularly, to see friends and family. I always take my camera. I have been photographing Lhamo Tsertso and Lobsang Chödron, the daughters of a close family friend, since they were two or three. I have made portraits of them every year that I’ve been back since. They’re 19 now.Twins are an obvious subject for photographers but, as the project has stretched over such a long period, it has evolved into something more. The girls have grown and changed with the environment around them, yet the resemblance between the two remains constant. In this portrait they were 15. When I arrived with my camera, they rushed off to their room to get changed. But they were gone for about half an hour, which felt very different from the previous years.Before, they would just stand there, not bothered by the process. This time, they came out wearing these incredible gingham dresses, reminding me of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. They had matching watches and they’d done their hair. It felt like a real transition: they’d started to become aware of how they were presenting themselves. We went out on to the balcony and, after a few shots, they picked up their rabbits. They had just celebrated their birthdays, and their father had bought them these albino rabbits as a gift. And there it was, the shot.Tibet is very rich in colour, lots of bright reds and greens. I’ve taken a lot of photographs in monasteries with monks and nuns wearing deep shades of maroon. So the colour palette here is unusual. The girls’ father is an architect, and they live in a town that was levelled by an earthquake in 2010. This is at their new house and the surrounding area was still quite dusty from building work. It was summer, too, and, being at 12,000ft, the light is crisp, harsh even. That’s why I always shoot on film. Digital just doesn’t do it justice. You can’t get the black tones in the shadows, or the bright highlights of the sun. Only film can handle the contrasts between the two.The rabbits speak to the Chinese influence, a sign of how things are changing. The concept of a pet rabbit is so foreign to the traditional nomadic way of life. Life was simple and, until recently, if you owned an animal in Kham, it had to have had some sort of purpose. A dri (female yak) will produce milk, butter, yoghurt, meat, fur, wool and glue (from the hooves) – none of the animal is wasted if it dies. People have such a respect for life and an awareness of death. Albino rabbits don’t like harsh climates – I don’t think they are able to survive temperatures as low as -10C. These rabbits didn’t last the winter.The girls speak Chinese to each other, and to their father, and Tibetan to their mother. I speak a Khampa dialect, a colloquial Tibetan with a strong accent. Someone once told me they could almost place my accent to the mountain on which I’d learned the language.Kham is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. You have no idea how many stars there are until you’ve seen the night sky above the plateau. But it is the people, not the place, that keep me going back: my family, my friends. Some of the best nights of my life have been sitting in my father’s small room at the top of the monastery with the monks and my family, just chatting and cracking up, real belly laughs. The time we have there is very special.Trained: BA Photographic Arts, University of Westminster.Influences: “My dad and, photographically, Mary Ellen Mark who made such emotive work, focusing on the margins of society, finding beauty in her subjects and presenting them with dignity.

At any rate I know I have for a husband one of the kindest, most humane men in the world.”Florence also wrote about how she was weary of celebrity culture and the media: “Accounts of me \u0026amp my portrait have been printed in every paper, I think, in England. I have been shown in the Cinematograph, written about all over America \u0026amp Europe. I am tired of this publicity.”The letters were kept by Barlow’s daughter, Josephine Barlow, and found after her death by his grandsons, Ian and Colin Nicol. The letters have been passed to Prof Angelique Richardson, of the University of Exeter, who is leading the Hardy’s Correspondents Project, as part of which letters connected to the author are being digitised.Richardson said: “It is rare to find such significant letters. They give an intimate glimpse into life at Max Gate and the loves and losses Florence shared with Hardy. It also shows us more about Florence, how self-deprecating she was and how devoted she was to her husband.”The second and third letters to Barlow were written 18 years later, in 1932, four years after Hardy’s death.She said: “I am writing this late in the evening alone, in the room where I first met my husband. A little French bull-dog is snoring by the fire – he is my faithful – \u0026amp generally my only – companion.”Florence added: “I thank you for your kind words of sympathy about my great loss. It was such a wonderful thing to live in close association with that great mind \u0026amp that noble personality. After having lived 14 years with such a companion it is little wonder that I feel intolerably lonely – \u0026amp find the world very empty.”The letters will be placed with the rest of Dorset Museum’s Hardy Collection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b9d5d07cfeced3e8a4435e1a9b0fa7b3f12a3e/98_0_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5982751468d3a9ba39386975a492e1f","title":"international booker prize shortlist led by 28 year olds debut","story":"The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld joins five other ‘expansively imagined’ novels contending for £50,000 awardDutch author Marieke Lucas Rijneveld has become one of the youngest writers to be shortlisted for a Booker prize, after their debut novel made the final line-up for the International Booker.Rijneveld, a rising star in Dutch literature, is 28 – slightly older than British author Daisy Johnson was when she was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2018, age 27. The author, who identifies as male and uses the pronouns theythem, was shortlisted after a six-hour virtual judging meeting for the £50,000 prize, which is shared equally between writer and translator, for The Discomfort of Evening, translated by Michele Hutchison. The novel, tells of a girl whose brother dies in a skating accident and draws from Rijneveld’s own experiences: when they were three, their 12-year-old brother was knocked over and killed by a bus.“Rijneveld’s language renders the world anew, revealing the shocks and violence of early youth through the prism of a Dutch dairy farm. The strangeness of a child looking at the strangeness of the world,” said judges of the work.The Discomfort of Evening is one of six novels in the running for the International Booker, each of which, said chair of judges Ted Hodgkinson, “restlessly reinvents received narratives, from foundational myths to family folklore, plunging us into discomfiting and elating encounters with selves in a state of transition”.Exploring trauma, loss and illness and translated from five languages – Spanish, German, Dutch, Farsi and Japanese – the shortlist, said Hodgkinson, “transcends this unprecedented moment, immersing us in expansively imagined lives that hold enduring fascination”.Shokoofeh Azar’s The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, translated by a writer who is remaining anonymous for security reasons, is narrated by the ghost of a 13-year-old girl fleeing her home after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. Daniel Kehlmann’s Tyll, translated from German by Ross Benjamin, draws from medieval German folklore to tell the story of trickster Tyll Ulenspiegel. And Fernanda Melchor’s Hurricane Season, translated by Sophie Hughes from Spanish, opens with the discovery of a murder victim in a Mexican village.The Adventures of China Iron, Gabriela Cabezón Cámara’s feminist retelling of Argentina’s foundational gaucho epic Martín Fierro, is translated by Iona Macintyre and Fiona Mackintosh from Spanish. And first published more than 20 years ago in 1994, Yōko Ogowa’s The Memory Police, translated by Stephen Snyder from Japanese, is a fable about an island where people and objects are made to disappear until the inhabitants forget they ever existed.“In these distracting and isolating times, it’s difficult to see beyond the current crisis, but through these exceptional feats of translation, we encounter characters and sensibilities which have lasting resonance,” said Hodgkinson, who is head of literature and spoken word at London’s Southbank Centre.“Some of the books on our shortlist uncannily channel the air of contagion into deft dystopias or plague-ridden historical epics, and some transport us to worlds as varied as a rural Mexican village and a Dutch dairy farm. But above all they grant us access to richly realised interior worlds, arresting enough to quieten any distraction and collapse any social distance.”Hodgkinson chaired a panel of five judges who selected the shortlist from 124 submissions. The coronavirus pandemic meant their meeting had to be virtual, but Hodgkinson said he and his panel still managed to discuss the line-up for more than six hours.“Of course there’s no substitute for being in the same room to discuss intricate matters of translation… but in the end it didn’t matter that we were as far apart as LA and Bangalore, there was enough rapport and mutual respect to traverse the distance and overcome any technical glitches,” he said.Hodgkinson was joined on the panel by Lucie Campos, director of the Villa Gillet, France’s centre for international writing International Booker-winning translatorJennifer Croft Folio-winning author Valeria Luiselli and the Booker-shortlisted writer, poet and musician Jeet Thayil.The winner will be announced on 19 May.The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree by Shokoofeh Azar, translated by Anonymous from Farsi (Europa Editions)The Adventures of China Iron by Gabriela Cabezón Cámara, translated by Iona Macintyre and Fiona Mackintosh from Spanish (Charco Press)Tyll by Daniel Kehlmann, translated by Ross Benjamin from German (Quercus)Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor, translated by Sophie Hughes from Spanish (Fitzcarraldo Editions)The Memory Police by Yōko Ogowa, translated by Stephen Snyder from Japanese (Harvill Secker)The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, translated by Michele Hutchison from Dutch (Faber \u0026amp Faber)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc222b7dcf697cc37be085b1a551bdcab7e23167/107_0_670_402/master/670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88ceaf27d6e801b42b6c9156285ccdf7","title":"the caravan by thomas hegghammer review abdallah azzam and the rise of global jihad","story":"A biography of the Palestinian warrior-scholar explodes myths surrounding the Soviet–Afghan war and shows why he is an icon for Muslim extremistsIn November 1989, a middle-aged Palestinian Islamist ideologue, scholar and organiser called Abdallah Azzam was killed when a bomb exploded under his car in Peshawar, northwest Pakistan. The news made no headlines in western papers. Azzam was almost unknown outside the chaotic, dynamic and erse world of extremist Islamism. In the west at least, he remains so.This is a shame. For contemporary Sunni Muslim extremists, Azzam is an icon. His many works are read and cited and his life held up as exemplary. His radical and controversial demand that participation in the global battle against unbelief is a personal obligation for all Muslims has been hugely influential. He crucially argued that they should disregard traditional authorities – governments, religious scholars, tribal leaders, parents – in matters of jihad. There have been extremist training camps named after him in Syria, mosques in Yemen, the West Bank, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Gaza and Sudan. If you want to understand contemporary Islamic extremism, you need to understand Azzam and his work.The Caravan, a biography of Azzam, is the result of a decade or more of work by Thomas Hegghammer, one of the most perceptive and informed scholars of radical Islamic activism working today. It is based on interviews, and a wealth of primary sources, mostly in Arabic. Though necessarily historical in its focus, Hegghammer never loses sight of Azzam’s impact on the present day.The book explores Azzam’s early years in a village on the West Bank, annexed by Jordan when he was 10, and his deepening involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood, the biggest Islamist organisation in the Middle East. In 1967, when the six-day war ended in a crushing Israeli victory, Azzam fled to join the mujahideen, as they called themselves, in the hills of northern Jordan, from where they launched raids on Israeli defence forces.From 1970, Azzam was an intellectual rather than a warrior. Devout, determined and focused, he earned a series of prestigious qualifications as a scholar of Islam. But he abandoned his successful academic career to support the Afghans in their fight against Soviet troops who invaded to bolster Kabul’s Marxist government in 1979. Over the next decade, Azzam, based in Pakistan, would organise and inspire a growing number of volunteers from all over the Islamic world, some of whom would fight alongside the Afghans and go on to furnish the core of the modern jihadi movement. He was neither a gifted logistician or manager but the appeal of this fiery warrior-scholar was potent when in front of the right audience, or disseminated via audio cassettes or video.The Caravan makes a number of very useful historical arguments with powerful resonance today. The most important perhaps is Hegghammer’s rigorous and impartial deconstruction of the myth that the US trained, or even created, the international legion of Islamic militants who fought in Afghanistan (among them Osama bin Laden) and then, once Moscow had withdrawn its troops, turned on their supposed erstwhile sponsors. This “blowback” theory has been so often cited that it is often accepted without interrogation. Hegghammer shows it to be – largely – bogus.This is not to say US policy was unproblematic, Hegghammer drily comments. The vast proportion of US support for the Afghan mujahideen went to the most extreme Islamist factions, who were very clearly profoundly anti-American. The CIA was criticised at the time for this but argued that these were the strongest groups militarily. The US also did little to limit the recruitment of foreign fighters. Azzam and other fundraisers went to the US many times and operated without hindrance: for more than a decade, America was among the most hospitable jihadist-recruitment grounds in the world.Another argument has raged over the responsibility of Saudi Arabia for the growth over recent decades of violent extremism among Sunni Muslims. Here Hegghammer also has important things to say, describing a cluster of institutions that promoted a resurgent Islamist internationalism from the late 60s. These were funded and founded by the Saudi Arabian state. They emphasised the unity of the ummah, the world community of Muslims, and highlighted outside threats. The discourse was alarmist, self-victimising, conspiratorial and chauvinistic, and crucial in preparing the ground for the more extremist and violent ideologies that swiftly followed, propagated by Azzam among others.As for who ended Azzam’s life, Hegghammer admits it is impossible to know. There are about a dozen candidates – spooks and jihadi rivals, for the most part. The most likely suspects are the Pakistani or Afghan security services, he says, but there is no proof. This is one mystery that has yet to be resolved.• The Caravan: Abdallah Azzam and the Rise of Global Jihad is published by Cambridge University Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f76ec6189ed98293b53449a7d76bce4ace7fa3/0_96_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5be24a1c332a31992cd2299a5f5b71a","title":"british gas braces for steep drop in revenues because of coronavirus","story":"Owner Centrica says business accounts have closed sites and warns many households will delay paymentsBritish Gas is bracing for a steep fall in revenues due to the coronavirus pandemic, as households delay paying their bills and its business customers close their sites.The owner of Britain’s largest energy supplier abandoned its cash flow forecasts for the year because it cannot predict how many households will be able to pay their energy bills, or how long they may defer payments to weather the coronavirus lockdown.The company also expects to sell less energy overall as a result of the pandemic, as increased demand from its seven million household customers working at home will not offset the reduction in demand from businesses. The supplier’s parent company, Centrica, told its investors – including more than half a million iniduals – that it would cancel its shareholder idend this year and cut spending plans worth a total of £400m. It will also scrap plans to pay senior executive bonuses, and freeze the pay of back office staff to help see out the crisis.Centrica’s share price plunged to fresh all-time lows of just under 34.6p, down sharply from around 90p a share in January this year before the combined impact of the coronavirus and the oil price collapse began to weigh on the struggling energy company.The 18-year lows on the oil market are expected to cut its cash flows by around £100m this year, although it is “difficult to quantify” the full impact of the coronavirus crisis on its 2020 financial results, the company said.“It is unclear how long the current situation will last, how customer behaviour may change, the impact on the wider economy, and the extent to which government financial support for households and businesses may help mitigate some of the expected effects,” the company said.The record share price lows come weeks after Centrica replaced its chairman and ousted its outgoing chief executive with immediate effect following a £1bn loss for 2019.Centrica had hoped to continue efforts to turn around its fortunes in 2020 after a torrid few years, marked by rising competition in the energy market and a government-mandated cap on energy bills.Its plan to sell its share of Spirit Energy, the North Sea oil and gas company, and its stake in the UK’s nuclear reactor fleet to focus on its customer business have also been derailed by the Covid-19 outbreak, it said.Chris O’Shea, the interim chief executive and chief financial officer, said: “While there are so many uncertainties surrounding the impacts of this situation, I am confident that we have acted promptly and prudently to underpin the long-term strength of Centrica.”The company’s board is continuing to look for a new chief executive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c277da98eb331b37377732a8d0536b264e72be8c/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50fec555e21015552904ae41c09b3598","title":"markets us jobless claims covid 19 economy recession coronavirus business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsNewsflash: National Express has announced it is fully suspending its national network of scheduled coach services across the UK from midnight on Sunday.The company says it can’t keep operating, given the ongoing lockdown.Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach, explains:“We kept a limited coach network running to be able to help those iniduals with essential travel needs but it is no longer viable to continue to do this.“Passenger numbers continue to fall as the public rightly follow government advice to avoid non-essential travel. The decision to temporarily suspend all services is the right one based on the current unprecedented circumstances and I hope our passengers understand this.“It is very clear that the critical thing we must do to protect our NHS and save lives is to stay at home. All journeys before Monday 6 April will be completed and we will ensure customers are not stranded but until further notice, we will not be running any service.The drop in UK employment levels last week is a very bad sign -- with further job cuts inevitable as the coronavirus crisis deepens.So says Nye Cominetti, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation: “The coronavirus-induced lockdown is having a profound impact on working families, with new ONS data showing that over a quarter of businesses have cut hours or jobs in recent weeks. This helps to explain why almost a million people have made a Universal Credit claim in the past fortnight. We have never seen this before. “With almost half of firms saying that they have been impacted negatively by the crisis, we can expect further job losses in the near future. “The government’s welcome Coronavirus Job Retention scheme will make a big difference to some workers who may have otherwise lost jobs. But huge numbers of people are still going to be facing big income hits, and difficult times lie ahead for many. It’s essential that Universal Credit is able to deliver for those who will desperately need help over the coming months.”Supermarket chain Morrisons has announced its tripling its bonus for UK staff this year.The changes will mean a bonus payment of £1,050 for a full-time frontline colleague compared to the £351 average last year, Morrisons says.Encouragingly, staff will still be eligible for the payment if they’re ill or self-isolating.Brompton aren’t the only people helping NHS staff cycle to work (see earlier post). The Bike Club, which rents out cycles, is offering London-based frontline workers free membership for the next couple of months. That could help vital staff avoid catching viruses on the underground.Unions representing airline workers fear many more jobs will be cut unless the government helps the airline sector. Prospect are urging ministers to heed pressure to aid companies such as Virgin Atlantic (which is seeking a state bailout), to help the wider UK aviation industry.Garry Graham, Prospect deputy general secretary, fears that governments won’t act, because airlines are owned, run or founded by some famous millionaires or billionaires - for whom public sympathy is rather thin: “The aviation industry is fighting for its survival. That means a million jobs, skills, vital regional, national and international connectivity, and the future of the economy are at risk if the government doesn’t intervene. “It is wholly unacceptable for ministers to glibly reference shareholders and a couple of unscrupulous owners as reason not to come to the industry’s rescue. Perception is important and when you equate a whole industry to two or three iniduals you completely dehumanise the hundreds of thousands of workers who could lose their jobs. Those workers deserve as much consideration as any other workers at this terrible time.“This is not just about perception though, it’s about a pragmatic regard for the future of the economy. If we have any chance of rebounding from this catastrophe then this industry which is critical to commerce and tourism, needs to be ready to restart as soon as possible. That means infrastructure, workforce capacity, workers themselves and their skills base, all need to be preserved.“However you feel about Branson, Stelios or O’Leary it is their workers and the whole economy that will pay the price if the government ignores this industry.”We reported earlier this month that wholesale prices for pain relief had spiked, forcing retailers to either push up their prices or take the hit.You can read the ONS’s new data on the UK economy here:The Office for National Statistics has also found a sharp jump in prices charged online for cough and cold medicine last week. Newsflash: A quarter of UK companies are already cutting staffing levels “in the short term” due to the coronavirus crisis.That’s according to a new survey of the British economy from the Office for National Statistics.These new ‘experimental statistics’ are an attempt to spot trends quickly in the UK economy. They confirm that the virus is having a dramatic impact on the British labour market (as was shown by the huge jump in Universal credit claims too).Here’s the key findings:Pets at Home has been deluged with demand since the Covid-19 crisis began.The company, which supplies doggie chews, rabbit food, hutches, cages, bedding, vets services and cuddly animals themselves, has reported a surge in orders last month. It has now raised its profit forecast for the current year, saying:In the closing weeks of the financial year we have, however, experienced exceptional levels of demand, both in-store and online, as the COVID-19 crisis has developed, and have seen existing customers increase average basket size by pulling forward purchases as well as new customers access our pet products and healthcare services.Pets at Home was classified as an ‘essential retailer’ by the government, meaning its shops can stay open. But in a concession to the coronavirus emergency it has closed its Groom Room salons, so Britain’s pets may soon look as shaggy-haired as their owners....You currently have to queue just to get onto Pets At Home’s website, as people try to stock up on key items for their furry or feathered friends.CEO Peter Pritchard says the firm is working “tirelessly” to help families through the crisis, adding: We are also providing support for the communities that need us through £1.1m of funding to nominated pet charities, a £1m crisis fund for colleagues and discounts to NHS workers as they care for the nation’s health.UK energy provider Centrica has joined the (swelling) ranks of companies cancelling their idends.Centrica has decided not to pay its 2019 idend, and also announced £400m in spending cuts this morning, after being hit by Covid-19. The company, which owns British Gas, has also withdrawn management bonuses.The covonavirus outbreak has hurt demand for gas from business customers, as many have temporarily shut down. Domestic demand has risen, but so have bad debt as people and businesses struggle to pay bills.This has forced Centrica to withdraw its financial guidance for year, warning that:We also expect to see an increase in working capital outflows and customer bad debt, as certain customer segments defer payments due to the reduction of household incomes and business revenues. Centrica says it is doing its bit to help:We are following all advice from government and relevant health organisations, and as a consequence we have stopped all non-essential customer visits to minimise contact. However, our service engineers will continue to attend breakdowns, and across the business we will remain available to all our customers, whilst prioritising those who are vulnerable and may need additional support over the coming weeks. We have several hundred UK service engineers who have volunteered to perform essential service visits to customers’ homes even where there may be higher risk of Covid-19, to ensure they have continued access to heat, hot water and electricity.The oil price is surging this morning, after Donald Trump suggested that Saudi Arabia and Russia could end their price war.Last night, the US president told reporters that:“I have confidence in both that they’ll be able to work it out,” It’s nearly a month since Saudi Arabia boosted its oil output by several million barrels per day, after Moscow refused to back an Opec-led production cuts plan.That sent crude reeling to 17-year lows. But this morning, Brent crude has leapt to $27 per barrel, from $25.45 last night.European stock markets have opened higher, shaking off some of Wednesday’s sharp losses.That lifts the index back to 5500.A couple of weeks ago Brompton Bicycle offered to lend 200 folding bikes to NHS staff at two London hospitals, free of charge, to help them get to work without having to risk infection on public transport.Today, the company says it has been overwhelmed, with 500 healthcare workers signing up. It doesn’t have enough bikes to meet demand, so Brompton is now unveiling a “Wheels for Heroes” plan to increase the number available to 1,000.Via a combination of crowdfunding and the loan of company resources worth £100,000, the company will ramp up production and make the bikes available for as long as lockdown continues. Anyone who wants to help fund bikes for the NHS can do so here.In the UK, British Airways is expected to announce it will suspend tens of thousands of staff because of the coronavirus pandemic.This would cover cabin crew, ground staff, engineers and head office employees, as BA reels from a slump in demand.The airline, which grounded its planes at Gatwick airport earlier this week, has been negotiating with the Unite union for more than a week.The two sides have reached a broad agreement but still need to hammer out some details, the BBC reported. A BA spokesperson said: “Talks continue.” The airline industry is feeling the full heat of the Covid-19 crisis. So with planes grounded worldwide, manufacturing giant Boeing is reportedly offering voluntary layoffs to employees.Reuters has the story:Boeing is set to offer buyout and early retirement packages to employees, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, a bid to mitigate the financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Boeing was initiating a voluntary layoff plan that allows eligible employees who want to exit the company to do so with a pay and benefits package, one of the people said. Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun is expected to detail a voluntary layoff plan in a memo to employees as early as Thursday, the second person said.Reuters predicts that the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits likely shot to a record high for a second week in a row:“The U.S. labor market is in free-fall,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “The prospect of more stringent lockdown measures and the fact that many states have not yet been able to process the full amount of jobless claim applications suggest the worst is still to come.”Initial claims for state unemployment benefits probably raced to a seasonally adjusted 3.50 million for the week ended March 28, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Estimates in the survey were as high as 5.25 million.Bloomberg agrees, pointing out that today’s figure will include people who couldn’t be counted in last week’s total. The highest estimate for today’s data is a staggering 6.5 million, they add:The claims report “will likely reflect both newly laid-off workers as well as states catching up on previously filed claims that had not yet been captured in the system due to overwhelming demand,” Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard wrote in a note While Friday’s payroll figures are forecast to show a more-modest decline in jobs in March, they reflect data from earlier in the month before most virus-related shutdowns. So, the bigger job losses -- and an unemployment rate potentially rising by several percentage points -- are more likely to show up in the April data due in May.The most dire prediction puts the figure at 6.5 million -- the forecast of Thomas Costerg at Pictet Wealth Management -- while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates 5.25 million and Citigroup is at 4 million.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.With the Covid-19 downturn in full swing, unemployment is spiking in America and Europe. Across factories, offices, shops, pubs and restaurants, people are being ‘furloughed’ where possible or simply laid off.Today we learn how many Americans filed jobless benefits claims last week, and experts fears it will smash the previous week’s record levels. Economists predict that today’s initial jobless claims figure will hit 3.5 million -- a new record, up from the 3.3 million reported a week ago. The previous record was below 700,000 people, so the sudden shutdown of America’s economy is quite unprecedented.Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that four million Americans filed unemployment claims last week -- and that the previous week’s record could be revised higher too!Last week’s print of just under 3.5 million is ripe for a dramatic upward revision. In particular, our US economists point out that despite California having reportedly seen one million claims through that week (according to the governor), less than 200k showed up in the number.For this week, we are looking for another sizeable 4 million increase. Joblessness is accelerating sharply in the UK too. Last night, the government revealed that nearly a million people applied for Universal Credit last week - an astonishing surge, showing how badly families across the country have been hit.The global Covid-19 case total is now approaching one million, putting a very serious strain on health systems worldwide (one major UK hospital nearly ran out of oxygen last week, we report). Medical experts insist that lockdowns, physical distancing and social isolation are the only way to beat the virus. That is going to mean a serious hit to economic growth (although letting coronavirus run riot, overwhelming the system, would hardly be better!).Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, says hopes of a rapid recovery have faded:With the global economy in freefall, markets have gone back to risk-off mode overnight as investors are struggling to look through President Trump’s ominous forecast suggesting Americans could keep dying into June.Now the markets dispute to come up with some alphabet letters to analogize a potential economic recovery. Still, it’s going to be anything but a “V” shape recovery. That’s for sure.

They, after all, hold the key to ending the pandemic. Yet in one vital respect their behaviour has more in common with the supermarket hoarders than the neighbourhood groups.Our exit strategy from the global lockdown depends on the development of an effective vaccine, as is well-known. A huge effort is under way to find such a vaccine, but we cannot afford to wait the 18 months it might take.In the meantime, as the death toll increases, doctors are desperate for treatments that would lessen the impact of the virus, by shortening the infection, reducing its severity and in that way saving lives. There is now a global hunt for a coronavirus drug. But it is a fight against time. The focus is therefore on existing treatments already proved to be safe for other diseases which will need less testing and be easier and quicker to manufacture in quantity.Scores of trials are under way around the world. The World Health Organization has identified four of the most promising therapies – including an HIV combination treatment, an anti-malarial and a drug developed but never used against Ebola - for testing in a global trial launched last month. But we cannot pause the search while waiting for the results. The need for new effective agents is too great.The best way to identify candidate drugs is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to crunch huge quantities of data to find the ones that might work. Major AI companies are putting their immense computing power at the service of scientists engaged in this hunt.But they are being hampered: because some pharmaceutical companies are failing to share all of the data on potential candidate treatments that they hold. Like toilet roll profiteers, they are keeping it stashed in their digital attics and cellars where others cannot get at it, on the grounds that it is commercially confidential.It was the open sharing of data around the world that allowed scientists to map the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at unprecedented speed, working across institutional, commercial and international boundaries in a unique collective effort against a common global enemy. We now urgently need all pharmaceutical companies to set aside their inidual commercial ambitions and join a similar collective effort to identify, test, develop and manufacture treatments to curb the disease.There is a precedent. Last June, 10 of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies – including Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline – announced they would pool data for an AI-based search for new antibiotics, which are urgently needed as antibiotic-resistant bacteria have proliferated across the world, threatening the growth of untreatable disease.That historic agreement was made possible by the development of a secure, blockchain-based system that allows an algorithm to search rival companies’ data with full traceability – but without revealing commercial secrets to competitors. The advantage of using blockchain is that companies can trust the code rather than their partners.AI researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s J-Clinic, who trained a neural network to predict which molecules will have antibiotic properties, announced in February that they had found a new compound which works against 35 different types of bacteria. They named it halicin, after the AI system in 2001: A Space Odyssey.AI is now being harnessed across the globe in the hunt for a coronavirus treatment, from Hong Kong to Israel to the UK and US. Last month the world’s fastest supercomputer, the IBM Summit, identified 77 compounds as potential candidates. Last week an AI platform run by Gero, based in Singapore, identified six drugs already approved for human use in other conditions which could help combat Covid-19. Meanwhile, Thomas Siebel, the billionaire head of C3.ai, a Californian artificial intelligence company, announced a public-private consortium including Princeton, Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, the Universities of California, Illinois and Chicago, as well as C3.ai and Microsoft, which will provide scientists with funding and access to some of the world’s most advanced supercomputers in the search for solutions to the pandemic.However, no matter how great the computing power or how advanced the software design, results from these initiatives will depend ultimately on the data fed into them. Without full access to comprehensive data, the scientists will be fighting with one hand tied behind their backs.All pharmaceutical companies must unlock their chemical libraries so candidate drugs can be identified, and trials to test the most promising treatments begin as soon as humanly possible. We cannot wait. Lives depend on it.• Prof Ara Darzi is a surgeon and director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London.

Hagley is where I grew up and where my parents live. A few teenagers were hanging around with not much to do, just as 40 years ago my mates and I hung around with not much to do. I couldn’t take my eyes off them. It was haunting, as if they were ghosts of my childhood. I thought ghosts were of old, dead people, but these callow youths were alive and kicking.I wonder where those young people are now. As far as I can see, and from what I have heard from my daughters, our much-maligned youth are respecting the command to stay at home more than their elders. Cynics might suggest this is because most of them can’t be arsed to go out at the best of times. Or maybe groups of them are holed up on the quiet in bedrooms, smoking weed or God knows what, while talking or watching drivel. But I doubt it. I don’t think they are such a bad bunch.Obviously, they have the advantage of social media to keep communicating, but I have been thinking about how it would have been for me if this had come to pass in the early 1980s. I really don’t think I could have borne it.In December 1981, we were snowed off school for several days. Oh, the joy. My mate Rich lived just up from the station in Hagley. Along with another friend we played snooker on a tiny table in his basement all day, every day. I can’t imagine any public health edict would have put a stop to that.Rich is presently locked down in Malaysia. “The three of us would have had to self-isolate together,” he said. “And you’d still never have beaten me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05c6a69cfcec82b459b938237605f36f2e2f6ab9/0_30_6247_3749/master/6247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3871e710ba526591cbe12e442ad7946","title":"wrong coronavirus world scientists optimism experts","story":"I can’t tell if my optimism is misguided when experts disagree on everything from mortality rates to preventive measures  • See all our coronavirus coverageI was wrong. Or I think I was. I heard Boris Johnson on 3 March leap into war mode and publish 28 pages of emergency plans, should coronavirus take hold in Britain. There were reports that “half a million could die”. I was sceptical.What was different this time? The experience of China through January was enough to put other countries on guard. A widely publicised study of the virus in the January Lancet by the University of Hong Kong professor Joseph Wu and his team warned the world that a global outbreak “could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases”. It called on all health authorities to prepare. We now know that governments round the world reacted very differently. Korea and Taiwan threw resources at testing, tracing and quarantining. In Europe, so did Germany and Sweden. Italy imposed increasingly severe lockdowns, followed by France, Denmark and Norway. The US did almost nothing Russia and many African nations likewise. Everywhere people were told to “listen to the science”.At first, the British government clearly did not take the virus seriously – despite Johnson’s 3 March clarion call. While the Koreans were installing drive-through testing booths and Poles were taking temperatures in airports, Johnson was joking about handwashing.Across Europe that week, pandemonium broke out. Deaths were rising in Italy and Spain. Lockdown was instituted on all sides. Ministers were clearly panicked by a report from Imperial College London under Prof Neil Ferguson, the most alarming document I have read outside the realm of nuclear war planning. In a welter of graphs and statistics, it rubbished the government’s mitigation strategy and advised full-scale “suppression”. Even if the virus was suppressed, the report warned it could return and would be as bad or even worse. The report estimated that deaths could range from 20,000 in the best-case scenario to the familiar half-million in the worst.On 23 March a clearly traumatised Johnson appeared alone on television, unattended by scientists and with a union jack behind him. He and his in-house scientists fell into line with Imperial’s projections. Schools should close, everyone should stay at home and he would bring in emergency powers with fines. In ham-Churchillian, he told Britons to show a “national spirit as they have done before” and come together – or rather stay apart.But “the science” appeared to lead us to differing conclusions. The same weekend Johnson did his volte face, an Oxford University team led by Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology, pointed out that figures on the morbidity of Covid-19 were virtually meaningless in the absence of testing. They suggested that half the population could have had already it mildly, which, if true, would imply the death rate was far lower than thought. Were that the case, it might seem more sensible to throw resources at the NHS and merely encourage people to avoid crowds rather than shut down the economy.Connoisseurs of academic backbiting can enjoy the eight scientists contacted by the Science Media Centre, who rubbished the Oxford study, though some carefully hedged their bets.Science was plainly suffering herd disagreement – leaving politicians floundering. There is clearly more than one side to this argument. Will Sweden prove better or worse than adjacent Denmark? One day the mother of all inquiries will tell us. For the present, all we know is that the world is conducting a massive real-time experiment in state authority.The world is not ided between “the science”’ and other mortals. Scientists are like the rest of us. They form assumptions and grasp at evidence to validate them. They are optimists or pessimists, by nature risk-taking or cautious. My wife and I share inputs, hear the same news and read the same papers. But I am an optimist and she is a pessimist. I think we could have stuck to the Swedish model. I think the crisis will be over in three weeks. She believes it will last months. It is not much comfort that we both have scientists on our side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e12c88a14ef6f68fd4a1d1ea368982c192c44dad/749_908_6146_3692/master/6146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be68d3593db50d88b03d1eca31ac5bc2","title":"hundreds of university staff made redundant due to coronavirus","story":"Lecturers, researchers and support staff with insecure contracts at three universities will lose their jobsHundreds of university staff on precarious contracts have been dismissed by their employers in a drive to cut costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.Staff on fixed-term contracts, including visiting lecturers, researchers and student support workers, at Bristol, Newcastle and Sussex universities have been made redundant or told their employment will or may end prematurely, or not be renewed.The job losses come as universities face a black hole of hundreds of millions of pounds in tuition fees from the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, with international students from China and other severely affected countries cancelling or postponing enrolments.The vice-chancellor of Sussex University, Adam Tickell, sent an email to department heads last week warning that “immediate action” was required to safeguard its finances.The email included a plan by the director of finance, Allan Spencer, to terminate the employment of all tutors on fixed-term contracts and agency staff, and to freeze recruitment indefinitely, including for posts where job offers have been made but not yet formally accepted.Tickell added that although the cost savings were calculated prior to the pandemic their implementation was being accelerated, with the warning that they must be strictly adhered to.Newcastle University has also sent out redundancy notices to academics on fixed-term contracts. The move prompted one student in the geography, politics and sociology to write to the vice-chancellor, Chris Day, about the welfare of the affected staff. He wrote: “The last thing we as students want to hear is that a number of academics on fixed-term contracts have been made redundant during this lockdown – there is an absolute lack of compassion here. By ending contacts the university is leaving them out in the cold.”Meanwhile Bristol University has dismissed 84 staff on temporary and short-term contracts due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In an email to the affected workers, the temporary staffing service manager said their contracts would end early on 9 April due to the pandemic.One of the affected staff, who has worked at the university for several years, said his current contract was due to continue for several more weeks. The support worker, who said he was still busy dealing with students concerned about the impact of the coronavirus on their studies, described his dismissal as “stressful and insensitive”.University and College general secretary Jo Grady said: “Universities should suspend any dismissals for at least the period of the crisis and then review staff needs. Staff dismissed at this time will find it almost impossible to secure alternative employment whilst the crisis continues.”“Furlough arrangements should apply to all staff - including those on insecure contracts - and the government should extend the one-year visa extension for NHS staff to cover people working in our colleges and universities. The government should underwrite funding at current levels and guarantee no institution will go to the wall.”Jordan Osserman, a fixed-term postdoctoral researcher at Birkbeck and one of the organisers of the #CoronaContract campaign against the cuts, said: “If they don’t want to poison the well, university management needs to act now and guarantee two years secure employment at or above current pay for all casualised staff — the bare minimum it will take for us to survive the effects of the virus on the job market and the economy.”A Bristol University spokesman said the institution had decided to end the temporary and casual worker contracts early where they could not work from home, or where the work was “not essential” to teaching or research. He added: “These staff were given two weeks’ notice instead of the usual one week.”A University of Sussex spokesman said the cost-cutting measures will end the use of temporary agency staff. He added: “All fixed term contract payments will be honoured till the end of the contract and then reviewed before the end of the term to determine if the contract will be extended.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c15b6e00b7a07c6040d86ff2f6e1c8a8e3f6fef/0_32_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12653a1ad3a7c864eee533b5c2477c96","title":"oceans can be restored to former glory within 30 years say scientists","story":"Major review reports recovery of marine life but a redoubling of efforts is still needed The glory of the world’s oceans could be restored within a generation, according to a major new scientific review. It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan.Through rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas.The scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world’s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high.However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.“We have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,” said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. “Failing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.”Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review’s international team, said: “Overfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.“One of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.”The review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored.Among the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring.“We’re beginning to appreciate the value of what we’re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things happening, whether that be poor water quality in rivers and oceans or sea level rise beating on the doorstep of coastal areas,” said Roberts.However, progress is far from straightforward. Pollution from farms and plastics still pours into the oceans, the waters are reaching record high temperatures, and destructive fishing is still taking place in many places, with at least one-third of fish stocks overexploited.“The Mediterranean is still pretty much a basket case,” said Roberts. “And there is horrendous overfishing throughout large parts of south-east Asia and India, where fisheries are just catching anything they trawl on the seabed to render into fish meal and oil.”The global heating of the oceans has driven the few hundred surviving northern right whales along the coast of the western Atlantic. Here, amid busy shipping lanes and lobster fisheries, they are killed by collisions or drowned in a tangle of ropes, according to Roberts, though new regulations are starting to help.The Gulf of Mexico suffers massive dead zones owing to huge amounts of manure and fertiliser running off midwest farms, and elsewhere albatrosses continue to be snared by long-line fishers, despite simple solutions being available.But examples of the benefits of restorative habits were growing, Roberts said, from the return of once abundant oyster beds that can clean huge volumes of water, to marine protected areas that can boost fishery catches nearby, such as by the Scottish island of Arran.The scientists’s review concludes that restoring the oceans by 2050 is a grand challenge that, with a global redoubling of conservation efforts, can be achieved: “Meeting the challenge would be a historic milestone in humanity’s quest to achieve a globally sustainable future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4dc71e26bdf76bae6bf41add96832b25ab05084/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4adad9f42df5773a59a037375746f0c","title":"uk likely to postpone cop26 un climate talks glasgow coronavirus","story":"Crucial UN conference will be delayed until next year as a result of the coronavirus crisisThe UN climate talks due to be held in Glasgow later this year have been postponed as governments around the world struggle to halt the spread of coronavirus.The most important climate negotiations since the Paris agreement in 2015 were scheduled to take place this November to put countries back on track to avoid climate breakdown. They will now be pushed back to 2021.A statement from the UN on Wednesday night confirmed that the meeting of over 26,000 attendees would be delayed until next year. It said new dates for the conference would be decided in due course.The UK energy minister and president of the Cop26 conference, Alok Sharma, held crunch talks with the UN and several other countries on Wednesday evening to confirm the timing of the summit. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule Cop26,” he said.“We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference.”The Cop26 meeting was scheduled to be held in Glasgow at the SEC arena, a venue that the Scottish government plans to turn into a field hospital to treat virus victims.The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to delay the vital talks because of the widespread disruption caused by coronavirus, and will also delay a key preliminary meeting scheduled for Bonn, Germany, which was also expected to be derailed by widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions.John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said it was vital that the delay should not allow governments to back down on their commitments to tackle the climate crisis. “The decision to postpone the climate talks in Glasgow was inevitable given the health emergency the world is currently facing,” he told the . “But while the summit has been delayed, the climate emergency can’t be put on hold. Government stimulus packages will hold the key as to whether this emergency significantly delays or advances progress on tackling the climate emergency.”Some campaigners believe there could be another advantage to delay, as the US presidential elections take place this November, just before Cop26 was scheduled to begin. With the summit delayed to next year, other governments will have time to adjust either to a second term of Donald Trump – who opposes the Paris agreement and is withdrawing the US from it – or a new president who is likely to support climate action.But several prominent climate experts had feared that delaying the talks would mean governments eased off on pursuing stronger commitments to fulfil the Paris goals.Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris summit in 2015, had argued for keeping Glasgow on track. On Wednesday night she accepted the delay but added: “Emissions must peak this year if we want to limit warming to 1.5C and the Paris agreement set the Cop26 summit as the moment when all countries would ramp up their targets in line with the steep emissions decline we need to see in this decisive next decade.”The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) welcomed the delay as the best hope of rebuilding diplomatic momentum before the talks take place. Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s CEO, said investors would support the decision because it “improves the likelihood of a strong outcome and ensuring that the world is put on a path to tackle the climate crisis”.But the delay will come as a blow to some climate campaigners, who have urged the UK government to proceed with the conference despite the outbreak to avoid stalling progress on global climate action. They believe since the Paris agreement, countries have failed to develop climate commitments that go far enough to avoid a catastrophic environmental breakdown. The Glasgow talks aim to galvanise tougher plans to cap rising temperatures by limiting greenhouse gas emissions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f259ccc6f9e0cb344c168b193f52539e93890bcf/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b09fdaf5987ca2b0d644936f48761e","title":"what wildlife can you see from your home coronavirus","story":"If you are locked down in an urban area due to coronavirus, we want to know what flora and fauna you can see from your homeLocked down in a city?

Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another’s space suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we’re not allowed to hug. So here are some answers to the questions that we are increasingly asking.This social distancing thing: how should I walk down the pavement? In the middle? On the left? On the right? Or next to the street so I can get right out of people’s way?If you are on your own, you can walk down the street however you damn please just keep an eye out for people coming towards you and maintain your distance. Try not to dawdle where the pavement narrows, especially if people might be coming up behind you. If you are walking as a couple, inconvenience yourselves – walk into the gutter, separate, go round the parked car – on behalf of anyone else. If you are walking as a family, go in the bubble formation, all members round some central member. You are not going to scatter in a uniform way as someone comes towards you, but they can see you, and if you all stick together, they can react accordingly.“The protocol,” explains Dr Jane Greatorex, a virologist, microbiologist and senior tutor at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, “is that nobody can breathe the virus on you. Experiments have been done looking at that. But if you are passing too close and an inidual coughs on you, then you do stand a chance of being infected.” This is the logic behind the two-metre distance: that someone outside that distance could indeed cough, and that would be OK. “This is going to sound really stupid,” Greatorex continues, “but people have to understand how big two metres is. Getting it across to kids in particular: my local Waitrose has a cardboard cutout of Jürgen Klopp.” (For non-football fans, Klopp is 1.93m tall, or 6ft 4in.) On the other hand, if someone walks past you without observing that two-metre distance, but hasn’t coughed or sneezed, there is no need to scream abuse at them.What should I do if someone gets too close, or looks as if they are about to?Sonia Adesara is a doctor, coming out of self-isolation to join the frontline against Covid-19 this week (I put it so dramatically to indicate that it is our duty to listen to her). “I think the general etiquette if there’s someone working at the till who every two minutes has a person coming close towards their face, try to give them a bit of space, because they’re being put in that situation by their work. But if someone’s jogging past and they’re suddenly within two metres, you need to understand that it’s not life or death. Someone running past you is not going to pass on the virus. It’s more sustained contact than that.” The reason we try to keep distance on public transport is in case of droplets.Is there any point in wearing a face mask? What about a scarf over your mouth and nose?Adesara says that if you are coughing and spluttering, anything that protects other people from droplets will help, although better etiquette is to cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw it away. Greatorex underlines the distinction between a paper face mask and full PPE equipment: “The sort of face mask that they’ll be wearing on intensive care wards has to be specially fitted, in order to prevent any virus particle getting on to your face.” It is rarely necessary for people to try to find that protection outside a clinical setting, although a care worker, going house to house, might want to wear a paper mask, because they will “stop a cough going ‘whoomph’ out of your mouth” (Greatorex). Of course, if you are actively coughing, you shouldn’t be outside at all, or working. So this is really advice for a surprise first cough.Is it safe to touch shop doors? Touchscreens? Your shopping? How can I make it safer?Greatorex explains: “Virus particles have an envelope, the lipid molecule. It will bind to some things really well – soft fabrics and paper – and it will die relatively quickly on those. But on hard surfaces – glass, plastic – that it won’t bind to, it can stay alive much longer. Stainless steel is a disaster.” Try to avoid touching hard surfaces with your hands altogether, and use an elbow or a shoulder if you can. Where you cannot avoid using your hands – escalator handrails, shopping trolleys, car doors – you should first and foremost avoid touching your face, come in the house, wash your hands, then put on plastic gloves and go out and clean the hard surfaces that you will regularly touch, such as your front door.As for food packaging, you are bound to pick it up, so just wipe it when you get home, washing your hands before and after.What about deliveries? Are they safe to take into the house at once?“The outside packaging is the only thing that’s really going to be a danger to you,” Greatorex says. “Treat everything from outside with a degree of caution, because someone’s packaged it.”What is the best way to wash any food I get to make sure it’s germ-free?Greatorex says: “Factory production lines, your Tesco ready meal, that’ll be as clean as a whistle. It will all have been done in a sterile environment. Fruit and vegetables, likewise, will mostly have been sorted by machines. I’d still wash an apple in soap and water, especially if it was from a farm shop.” Wait: she would wash an apple with soap? “Well, I am a microbiologist.”You should treat all food with a degree of caution unless you have grown it yourself. If you think that is ridiculous, remember the salmonella outbreak that came from strawberries, or the infections you can get from bagged salad.Should I be regularly disinfecting my bank card, my phone etc?You should wipe your phone down with a cloth and disinfectant twice a day. If you have mostly used contactless payment, your bank cards should be OK. Most people seem to have given up using cash, not so much for the potential for infection from the cash itself – although the virus can survive better on polymer notes than on paper – but because you don’t really want to be handing things to anyone.Should I wear gloves in the supermarket – and are woolly ones at all effective if I don’t have latex gloves?Woolly gloves are worse than pointless. They trap the virus, so you still have to wash them regularly – and hands are easier to wash.I have been out to exercise once and didn’t see a single person. Does this really have to count as my one piece of exercise? Is it OK to go out again?This is all about messaging: if you went out once and saw nobody, of course you haven’t infected anyone. But people who live in built-up areas are going to find it impossible to get that level of isolation, and it will be corrosive to harmony if we say the strictest rules are only for people who live in tower blocks. What we are trying to avoid is the measures becoming any more stringent: in France and Germany, you are not allowed more than a fixed number of metres from your front door. And that will involve abiding by rules for which there seem to be scant microbiological foundation.Shopping for food or medicine, exercise, feeding animals and looking after other people who are self-isolating. Especially if they are cocooning for 12 weeks, waving at them through a window counts as essential, so long as you combine it with something else they actually need. If you are going stir-crazy, the best thing you can do is join your local volunteer group, which always has essential errands.How long should I carry on paying my childminder, cleaner etc if I cannot use them?This is not a medical question as such, but over to Adesara: “You should pay everyone you normally employ for as long as you can afford to. You have to think about what other people’s situations are: you may not be using their services, but that person also needs to feed themselves and their families.”It it OK to meet up with people who live close by if I keep two metres away?As long as you maintain your distance – Greatorex still talks to her neighbours over the fence. If you see someone you know when you’re taking your essential exercise, of course you can say hello.Can I let my dogs and cats socialise with others? Can they pass on coronavirus?There have been reports of two dogs having caught the virus from their owners, but there is no evidence of animals being able to pass it on, so it is still OK, in a park, to let your dogs frolic so long as you do not get too close to the owners. Good luck stopping your cat from socialising.How do I tell someone they are not behaving safely?Ask yourself first whether or not you are enjoying playing the world’s police officer a little bit too much. Delivery drivers and other essential workers report having been harassed in the street for being out, when they are on their way to work. It is much easier for some people to self-isolate than it is for others, and consider before you judge someone else’s behaviour the possibility that their situation is more complicated than you appreciate. There are very few circumstances in which upbraiding someone will be more effective for your safety than simply moving a bit further away from them. Adesara is unnerved by how much the police are relishing their new powers: “One force’s social media feed was shaming someone the other day for walking her dog in high heels. But there is really nothing dangerous about walking your dog in heels.”Do I need to wash my clothes and have a shower as soon as I get in after I have been outside even if I have not touched anything?This somewhat depends what being outside entailed. Greatorex’s sister works in a supermarket, where she interacts with a large number of people, and changes into fresh clothes at the end of work, brings her uniform home in a bag and puts it straight in the washing machine (having first washed her hands). Other people in similar high-contact jobs – teachers who are still working, for instance – have been advised to keep a bin bag at their front door and their washing machine open, then strip as soon as they walk in, put all their clothes in the bag, have a shower, then wash the clothes.If you are just going out to make an essential journey, make sure you have a jumper or coat that you wear only outdoors.Do I need to wash my hands all the time and not touch my face even if I haven’t been out of the house for a week?“If you never see anybody, no. Even if there was once virus on any of your surfaces, it will die off and you’ll be surrounded by dead virus,” Greatorex reassures us.How do I stop myself eating all the lockdown snacks?People seem to go one of two ways, either eating everything they can see, or losing their appetites with anxiety. It is actually better to be eating all the snacks, because at least it will cheer you up.You could do elaborate menu plans and try to stick to three meals a day. Or you could just give yourself a break. I got so bored the other day, I taught my dog to back away from cheese. I put it on Twitter, and someone said: “That’s great – can you teach me?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9018f055b3426cb09f10dcebac9c4a5d4846eeb7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f745dfc1667b1d2d7fbd1c559c63c1","title":"why im celebrating the women in lockdown who get all dressed up with nowhere to go","story":"Rihanna shows how it’s done with her durag on the cover of this month’s Vogue, while the #DontRushChallenge showcases black women’s makeup skills in all its erse glory. I’m off to find a lipstick to match my slippers ... Rihanna, the reigning queen of stay-at-home couture, made history yesterday, appearing on the cover of British Vogue in a durag, the choice of bedtime headwear for many black people. Way ahead of last year’s nightwear as a daywear trend, she previously donned one covered in Swarovski crystals at the CFDA awards in 2014. In 2013, she wore a doobie wrap – a common interim style black women use to keep freshly treated hair intact during the night – at the American Music awards. Her taste in headgear makes me feel much more chic as I work from home in a polyester durag and oversized shirt.I miss going out, but I miss getting ready to go out probably just as much, if not more. And it’s not just me – as the #OOTD hashtag declines during lockdown, the @wfhfits Instagram account, which documents the showstopping outfits contributors are wearing to work from home, is now 18.4k strong. The #DontRushChallenge takes this to the next level. Started by Twitter user @lase_asoloo, participants go from drab to fab in the (slickly edited) tap of a makeup brush. Much like the DMX Challenge – which last year saw women showcasing various hairstyles synced to the 46 names the rapper lists on his song What They Really Want – the #DontRushChallenge is dominated by #blackgirlmagic and has been an utter joy to watch.The first and foremost reason is that the challenge is an antidote to the still-monolithic representations of black women in the media. Even with that industry’s newfound commitment to ersity, ersity within that ersity is often an afterthought. And yet the #DontRushChallenge could not be more multifaceted: we have seen plus-size black women along with black girls with piercings and some in fetish gear. There’s one for naturalistas (black women who have made the decision to forgo chemical hair treatments) and another for bald black women. Black women across the globe have joined in from Britain, the US, Belgium, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya. On the continent, participants represent the specificities of their culture from different ethnic groups and tribes (such as Yoruba women from Ibadan in Nigeria and Habesha women from Ethiopia and Eritrea), who are usually lumped together as homogenous citizens of the mythical country called “Africa”.Scrolling the hashtag reminded me just how fun it is to dress up for the sake of it. The idea that the only reason women bother is for male attention or validation (an assumption that is as misogynistic as it is heteronormative) is pervasive. The view of makeup as a form of trickery is also prevalent the “take her swimming before the first date” and “makeup sorcery” memes have routinely been used to shame women, especially black women. But here, the bare faces and hair bonnets in the “befores” are as integral to challenge as the high-glam, at times unrecognisable “afters” there is nothing to hide, but plenty of craftwomanship to show off. Bravo, ladies I’m off to find a shade of lipstick that complements my slippers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001830d20a63022669482a71a43f97d0e40aa964/0_539_1831_1098/master/1831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c63aa669bc57518625bc8b9ff2b0edf8","title":"tiger king joe exotic netflix southern queerness","story":"Who could have guessed that a mullet-wearing, polyamorous exotic animal owner would become TV’s most talked-about gay star?In the early 2000s, the most popular queer characters on TV were Jack McFarland and Will Truman of the sitcom Will \u0026amp Grace. Will and Jack were so beloved, Vice-President Joe Biden once theorized the show had played a major role in shifting views on marriage equality. The characters were also the start of a trope that would prevail on TV for years: the cosmopolitan gay male. The image would live on in shows such as Queer as Folk, Looking, and the reality competitions Project Runway and America’s Next Top Model. Who could imagine that 20 years on, a mullet-wearing, gay, polyamorous exotic animal owner from rural Oklahoma would become TV’s biggest talked about gay star?Joe Exotic, the eccentric subject of the Netflix docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, has amassed a fervent following in the short time since the show’s premiere on Friday. The rapper Cardi B live-tweeted her reactions and expressed a desire to start a GoFundMe campaign for Mr Exotic, whose full name Wikipedia gives as Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (né Schreibvogel). Fans have taken to dressing up as Joe, slapping on fake handlebar mustaches and blond mullet wigs. And actors such as Dax Shepard and Jared Leto are pitching themselves to play the gun-loving zookeeper in a forthcoming scripted miniseries. Amid the anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, we are finding humor and relief in an imperfect, self-described “redneck” queer who owns more than 200 tigers. He’s the furthest cry from the affable, anodyne queer men who typically win America over, such as Cam and Mitchell of Modern Family and the “gay best friend” cast of Queer Eye. But unlikely times call for an unlikely hero.“It’s possible people need a really flawed person to humanize right now,” says Matt Brim, professor and author of Poor Queer Studies. Brim says the love for Joe might be more complicated than it immediately appears to be. “What is the calculus here? For some viewers, Joe Exotic’s rural white queer class identity may be his flaw, so that looking past or accepting it signals tolerance, that most passive-aggressive of power plays. For other viewers, those same qualities – in their specific and unwieldy combination – may represent the very soup of our common dilemma. One thing’s for sure: we’re not in South Bend any more,” he said, referring to the city where the former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was mayor.Joe belongs to a rural, Republican-voting, working-class background, which makes for great TV for those who have a superficial understanding of the south. Joe appears to be keenly aware of this fact, playing into the shock value of his queer, southern life. Before Tiger King, he pitched multiple reality shows about his life to networks and starred in country music videos with his husbands. He is the perfect kind of reality star – straddling the line between an unrestrained “big” personality and a caricature.Joe’s queerness and southern-ness intersect in distinct, complex ways. This includes his use of meth, a popular gay recreational drug. (In 2018, Oklahoma, site of Joe’s zoo, was listed as having one of the highest rates of meth use in the US.) He goes out of his way to associate with traditional ideas of masculinity through his love for guns, collection of large, aggressive animals, and pursuit of young, butch men who have previous histories of only dating women.In the show, Joe says he fell in love with tigers while recovering from a suicide attempt he linked to his parents’ homophobia. Did Joe decide the best way to reconcile his queerness with his surroundings was to assimilate in the most extreme ways – leaning into the love for hunting and control over wildlife that dominates southern culture? Then he cultivated this assimilation and it grew into a profitable persona. Joe made it so that the most outrageous thing about him in Oklahoma was neither his queerness or poly relationships. It was his tigers.Despite his progressive lifestyle, Joe himself is not a progressive. He believes in unregulated gun rights and, during his bizarre, far-fetched run for governor of Oklahoma, positioned himself as a libertarian. A viral video shows him pondering why black people can say the N-word but white people can’t. However, his queerness complicates this otherwise predictable ideology. At his wedding, we see Joe and his two husbands dressed in fuschia western shirts – none of the elements feel coherent or like they belong together. Since its legalization in 2015, same-sex marriage no longer possesses the same air of radicalism and defiance. But a polyamorous one? Even the progressives in Brooklyn might bat a lash at that.In Tiger King, Joe presents a less than perfect view of himself – from his meth use to nasty spats with co-workers to his tragic, failed marriages to allegedly straight men. But, in many ways, Joe’s imperfections (and criminal convictions) are what make him feel like a breakthrough for queer representation. Because “perfect” is so 1998.However, there is the danger we are collectively laughing at Joe and his rural background, instead of laughing with him.Representation of queerness in red states has always been sparse and complicated. The portrayals often face accusations of being exploitative or overly simplistic. A recent one was John B McLemore of the hit podcast series S-Town. McLemore was a queer horologist living in Woodstock, Alabama, a small, conservative place he hated. Critics called the podcast “voyeuristic” and irresponsible for outing McLemore after his death. Netflix’s Queer Eye occasionally chooses LGBTQ+ subjects living in conservative locales for its transformations, and the show’s format – “fix all your problems in an hour” with a group of affluent, pro-consumption coastal gay men – has drawn scrutiny.Does the novelty of a complicated figure such as Joe Exotic expose our preferences for coastal queer narratives? “Yes,” says John Howard, professor and author of Men Like That: A Southern Queer History. “For 25 years, scholars have criticized a bicoastal bias in US queer history that has focused attention on east and west coast metropolitan areas. But this is changing.” Howard points to the conversations Tiger King is producing. “Let’s hope the public debate expands. Perhaps we’ll learn more about working-class queers and trans people of color who, as yet, remain at the margins of Joe’s narrative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00be7cea913a27c3a9a2c55567cad4abbc998125/0_0_2048_1230/master/2048..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=300d30be860b9232b4356c2336df5606","title":"loan credit card payments frozen uk financial regulator coronavirus","story":"Financial regulator fast-tracks measures to help consumers during coronavirus crisisThe financial regulator has announced plans to freeze loan and credit card payments for up to three months as part of emergency measures for consumers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.The measures, which would usually require a lengthy consultation, could come into force as soon as 9 April. The Financial Conduct Authority said the process was being fast-tracked “given the national emergency and the significant impact on consumers’ finances right now”.It is aimed at consumers and renters who are not benefiting from existing relief measures that have targeted homeowners – with mortgage payment holidays – or business owners.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The proposals include a temporary freeze on loan and credit card payments for consumers who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the outbreak.The FCA said consumers who were at risk of having their credit cards suspended because of the regulator’s new affordability rules would not lose access to their accounts.Lenders would also have to waive interest charges on arranged overdrafts up to £500 over the same period, which would extend relief already announced by some banks including Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds.But the FCA’s emergency measures force firms to make sure all customers are “no worse off” due to the changes, meaning some customers may revert to lower interest rates.Banks and credit card providers will have to ensure that consumer credit ratings are unaffected by any of the measures, the FCA said.The FCA’s interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard, said: “Coronavirus has caused an unprecedented financial shock with far-reaching consequences for consumers in every corner of the UK.“If confirmed, this package of measures we are proposing today will help provide affected consumers with the temporary financial support they need to help them weather the storm during this challenging time.”The news has been welcomed by consumer advocates including Martin Lewis, who said it would help level the playing field for customers who may not have time to shop around for better rates during the crisis.Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “We have already seen many unsecured lenders put some forbearance criteria in place … However the provision is patchy and has become a banking lottery and that’s unfair – no one could have taken into account when they signed up for products how considerate each lender would be in these extraordinary times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c5db14be3952da69c545836c029afdd3f2c6f78/815_25_1640_984/master/1640..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f688b5f31dc5f9ce42a477ac865833e","title":"dolly parton 1m coronavirus vaccine research","story":"Donation to comes as singer launches bedtime story video series for children in lockdownDolly Parton has donated $1m (£800,000) to research into a coronavirus vaccine, as she begins a new storytelling series for children in lockdown.The country music star wrote on Instagram:My longtime friend Dr Naji Abumrad, who’s been involved in research at Vanderbilt for many years, informed me that they were making some exciting advancements towards that research of the coronavirus for a cure.

There were people from alternative rock: Ted Leo, Dashboard Confessional. There were people from Hollywood and theatre: Tom Hanks, Fran Drescher. There were TV personalities (Kathy Griffin) and politicians (New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy) and novelists (Stephen King). There was the superstar producer who summed it all up: “Adam Schlesinger took pop music writing to its classiest and most untouchable place,” said Jack Antonoff. “An honour to live at the same time he made his work.”So many people, from so many different strands, because Schlesinger wasn’t one thing he was a musical omnivore. He was the Grammy-winning rock musician with Fountains of Wayne he was the pop sophisticate of Ivy he was the songwriter providing faux hits for movies about musicians (That Thing You Do!, for which he was nominated for an Oscar, Hugh Grant’s 80s pop hit in Music and Lyrics) he was the writer who soundtracked a musical TV series (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) and who wrote for Sesame Street. He even managed to pick up an Emmy for a song written for a different awards show – his musical pastiche It’s Not Just for Gays Anymore, for the 2011 Tony Awards – and then do it again with another song for the same ceremony the following year. There was seemingly no style he could not master. He was, genuinely, one of the pop geniuses of the past quarter-century.Schlesinger’s work was borne of a deep love of and respect for songcraft. “For me, it’s just more satisfying when you follow the rules rather than just make a bunch of sounds,” he told me in 2011. “The magic of just making noise in the studio goes away after a while. That’s not to say I don’t sometimes respond to music just for the sound of it. But writing something within those old song formats is just harder to do than making a bunch of noise.”I fell in love to the sound of Fountains of Wayne. I got married in March 1997 and we honeymooned in the south. I picked up a cassette of the band’s debut album on the first day, and we hammered it as we drove around the Carolinas and Georgia. These were songs perfectly tailored for driving around America, flush with love: choruses so big they seemed to turn a hard-top into a convertible lyrics so wry each line held a new treasure. They became “our band” – we went to see Fountains of Wayne at festivals, in clubs, in theatres. We insisted to our friends that they needed to hear this band. When they finally had an actual hit, with Stacy’s Mom in 2003, I was thrilled other people were paying attention.I loved Fountains of Wayne so much that when they disappointed me I took it personally: the gigs where Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood seemed slightly underwhelmed, like superstar football players forced to turn out in a midweek cup tie against a lower-ision team. But the records never let me down.There were obvious antecedents for Fountains of Wayne – the chunky powerpop of Cheap Trick, the sharp observations of Squeeze – but, as time went on, the group’s distinctive voice became more and more pronounced. The “hits”, such as there were, tended to be the uptempo tracks with the slightly snarky lyrics, but, as I got older I came to love more the gentler, more heartfelt songs. I don’t know who wrote what, because Collingwood sang everything and all the songs were credited to both, but I’m not sure it really matters. Fountains of Wayne songs were Fountains of Wayne songs, and the voice I heard in the sad, empathetic numbers I came to love – Sick Day, Fire Island, Hey Julie, Hackensack, The Man in the Santa Suit – was clear and distinct.So I don’t know if it was Collingwood or Schlesinger who wrote my favourite Fountains of Wayne song, the one I put on when news came through that he was seriously ill with coronavirus. It’s a song about failed love whose chorus translates to these days, wholly accidentally: “Maybe one day soon it will all come out  How you dream about each other sometimes  With the memory of how you once gave up  But you made it through the troubled times.”I hope you make it through the troubled times. And I mourn Adam Schlesinger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408f794d90bfb57df805e3dfde88fbd73d2cc40c/0_172_3600_2162/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa78682ce1bf8837a679e38920009667","title":"pj harvey where to start with her back catalogue","story":"Our Listener’s Digest series continues with the raw and anarchic songcraft of the two-time Mercury prize winnerStories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2000)If you’ve previously cowered from the sublime Polly Jean, or if you just want to reconnect with her, start with her pop record, or, as she called it, “pop according to PJ Harvey, which is probably as un-pop as you can get to most people’s standards”. Stories came a decade into a career in which she’d swung between blues rock, gothic balladry and the anarchic spirit of punk, dressed up in her gorgeously deep, occasionally West Country-tinged, Americanised vocals. It was also a much more direct, immediate proposition of who she was, turning up the colour on her extraordinary palette of styles and emotions.Stories is also one of the best albums ever made about the madness and intensity of new love. It is cinematic and high octane throughout. Big Exit begins proceedings like a lusty, full-throttle Bonnie and Clyde homage, Harvey’s character feeling immortal with her lover and desperate for a gun. Good Fortune is more tender, speaking of the erotic surrender that arrives when you’re falling for someone. Bad luck gets thrown off tall buildings. Little Italy and Chinatown glow behind love-fuelled hangovers. Harvey’s protagonist becomes a bird of paradise. The lovely production takes us there with her, our hearts full in our mouths.It’s also a record where a woman is articulating her sexual hunger without apology. We’re given characters on rooftops, in bed, on the bed, telling us how immediate these feelings feel. The first line of This Is Love sums it all up: “I can’t believe life’s so complex  When I just want to sit here and watch you undress.”The artwork for Harvey’s breakthrough album says a lot about its sound. Here’s a pre-Raphaelite Ophelia in the lake, but rail-thin, and in heavy drag: Harvey’s creating classic art, essentially, but giving it a fierce, distressing twist. For this album, Harvey was without Steve Vaughan and Rob Ellis, her original band, for the first time, and wrote these songs in the remote countryside. Her new solo personality rages from even its softest corners. The echo of Patti Smith’s raw poetry mixes with ragged blues, and folk’s obsession with lost sons and daughters rubs against earworm melodies. C’mon Billy and Down By the Water were played heavily on Radio 1’s evening schedule at the time, and remain hard to shift from the mind.Stripped down to bare, brittle bones, Harvey’s early talent crackles and burns. This isn’t exactly Polly Jean’s Nebraska, but evokes dusty plains in a similar way, even if those plains are being prowled by a vengeful, ferocious woman in her early 20s. Rid of Me, in particular, sounds startling here, a terrifying expression of a woman not accepting the departure of her lover (“I’ll tie your legs  Keep you against my chest”), while Yuri-G shows another desperate to leave heartbreak behind for outer space. And god bless 50ft Queenie, gentler here than on Rid of Me, but no less menacing: “I’ll tell you my name: F-U-C-K”.2011’s Let England Shake might have grabbed all the plaudits (and a second Mercury prize after Stories from the City), but it also marked the moment Harvey stopped creating distinct, artistic inner worlds and turned to politics, often with less interesting results (The Hope Six Demolition Project feels a little simplistic and patronising four years on). This overlooked album sees Harvey learning piano for the first time, her singing high, strange and eerie, resulting in her saddest, most despairing collections of songs. When Under Ether suggests a female, gnarly twist on TS Eliot’s Prufrock (“When under ether  The mind comes alive”). Broken Harp, featuring the instrument in question, is its bleak flipside (“Please don’t reproach me for how empty my life has become”). The Piano’s lyrics could be straight off Dry, but its delivery is delicate, desperately mournful and, crucially, new. It’s Joy Division’s Closer in Emily Dickinson’s clothes a Northern soul compilation straight after to cheer things up might be a good idea.Who Will Love Me Now? (B-side to That Was My Veil, John Parish and PJ Harvey, 1996)Written by film and TV composer Nick Bicât, this plays like a lost theme from an eerie 1970s children’s drama, its lyrics rolling out like an exquisite, macabre fairytale. John Parish’s guitar plays a sweet melody against vaguely trip-hoppy stuttering rhythms, then Harvey enters full angelic mode. “In the forest is a monster  It has done terrible things,” she sings, beautifully and sadly, before it’s revealed who the monster really is.PJ Harvey: “I feel things deeply. I get angry, I shout at the TV, I feel sick”, by Dorian Lynskey, the Observer (2011)A fantastic profile of Harvey from the time of Let England Shake, which digs deeply into her personality, presentation and politics, and how her art school approach has shaped her career.Crack Actor: PJ Harvey’s To Bring You My Love at 25, by Ben Hewitt, the Quietus (2020)A glorious, thorough dig into each track, assessing Harvey as an actor as much as a musician and comparing her with Marlon Brando: “An actor with intense, chameleonic charisma, as tough, scary, heartbreaking or unnerving as each role demands, bringing the record’s desperate souls to life with her full-blooded, full-bodied portrayals.”PJ Harvey’s Rid Of Me: A Story, by Kate Schatz (2007)A deeply peculiar but fittingly twisted response to Harvey’s second album, from the experimental 33 13 series of album reappraisals. This is a particularly off-beam approach: a novel in which two young women find themselves together in a house in a forest that borders their hometown, fighting forces that oppress them from both their present and the past. The 14 chapters follow the track listing, and sex, revenge and love feature highly. Anything to keep them entertained in self-isolation.• What’s your favourite PJ Harvey album or song?

We are exploring options with the parliamentary authorities in readiness for parliament’s return.”It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 31 March, more than 938,000 people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 47,200 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 13,100 fatalities, and there have been over 9,300 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 216,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 194,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.A source said the plan would be in place by the end of the month. There have been calls from across the political spectrum for MPs to be allowed to scrutinise the government remotely at a time of enormous social upheaval and as freedom of movement is being curtailed by new laws to encourage physical distancing and self-isolation.The government came under pressure to set up a virtual parliament after an unusual intervention by Hoyle on Wednesday. In a letter to Rees-Mogg, the Speaker said MPs should still be able to take part in prime minister’s questions, and put questions to government departments and ministers even if they could not return to Westminster as scheduled on 21 April.Hoyle argued that a trial of virtual select committee hearings had already been successful and he had asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology for use in the Commons chamber.Hoyle wrote: “Once the house returns, if we are still in the grip of the crisis where the physical presence of members, or too many members, in the palace is not appropriate, I am keen that they should be able to participate in key parliamentary proceedings virtually, for example oral questions, urgent questions, statements.“The House Service has already trialled some virtual select committee evidence sessions with witnesses, and I have asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology to the types of business listed above.”The Speaker also asked if it would be possible for the government to set up a forum of MPs during the recess, possibly via select committee chairs, who could quiz senior government representatives at set times on different days.“MPs are being swamped right now with questions and casework from distressed constituents who need answers,” he said. “Responses cannot wait for the house to sit again.”A hundred MPs from Labour, the Scottish National party and the Green party wrote a letter last week to the Commons clerk, John Benger, asking for his support in setting up a form of digital parliament.Parliament broke for recess a week early as the number of cases of Covid-19 around Westminster increased.

It notes that courts are “currently unable to start any new jury or summary trials and most current trials have had to be stopped because of problems over the attendance of victims, witnesses, defendants, advocates and jurors”. Cases deemed to be “immediate” are those where the police or investigators seek a charging decision that would lead to a remand in custody. The advice states: All Covid-19 related cases will be dealt with as immediate cases for the purpose of obtaining a charging decision, whether they are custody or subsequently on bail.There have been already several, swift prosecutions and convictions of people who have coughed on officers claiming to be infected with the virus. Other non-priority cases can be listed with a summons up to 84 days ahead, relaxing previous prosecution deadlines. We are facing unprecedented challenges to the criminal justice system but our message is clear – we have no intention of letting crime go unpunished. However, priority must be given to the most serious cases to make sure dangerous offenders are dealt with quickly, this is why we have worked with police colleagues to give clear guidelines on this. Offences which relate to Covid-19, including assaults on emergency workers, will be treated as high priority.The family of an NHS worker who died suddenly from Covid-19 after treating patients with only gloves for protection is appealing for help to pay for his funeral.Thomas Harvey, a 57-year-old healthcare assistant who had worked for the NHS for more than 20 years, fell ill after treating a patient who later tested positive for coronavirus.His family had called 999 twice the week before he died and were told it was “not an emergency” though he was breathing badly.If you would like to make a contribution, his family’s GoFundMe page is here.The BBC has more on this story.The Francis Crick Institute, a renowned research centre, which has been turned into a coronavirus testing facility for NHS staff, aims to conduct hundreds of tests every day. The institute’s research laboratory has been repurposed so it can carry out Covid-19 tests at a rate of 500 a day by next week - rising to 2,000 a day in future. It is hoped the testing will give NHS staff – who may have suspected symptoms or are self-isolating because family members are ill – the information they need to know whether they can safely return to work. It comes after reports that offers of help from some of the UK’s leading scientific institutions to boost Britain’s rate of testing have been ignored by medical officials.

It begins on Friday 3 April at 7pm with a 1999 film of the stage show, directed by Maria Friedman and starring Osmond as Joseph, Richard Attenborough as his father, Jacob, and Joan Collins as Mrs Potiphar.A week later, on Good Friday, the show will be the 2012 arena production of Jesus Christ Superstar with Tim Minchin as Judas, Mel C as Mary Magdalene and the radio DJ Chris Moyles as Herod.Further productions in The Shows Must Go On series will be announced in due course. meanwhile will stream archive content from Hampstead theatre, currently Mike Bartlett’s 2016 Edward Snowden-inspired thriller Wild. It is available until 10pm Sunday 5 April.A Lake District police chief has expressed concern that isolation fatigue could be settling in for the public as the number of car journeys continues to rise.Cumbria police last week declared the Lake District “closed” after there was a large increase in visitors despite the government warning against all but essential travel.Now 10 days into the formal lockdown, Andy Slattery, the assistant chief constable who is leading the region’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, said he was concerned that “boredom and frustration” was setting in and people were getting back into their cars. Figures released by the government on Wednesday showed a recent rise in vehicle use across the UK.He said the number of visitors to the Lake District had dropped but that police were still having to tell day-trippers to go home: Our officers have spoken to people who are still coming into the area. We’ve stopped and spoken to day-trippers from the north-east and the north-west thinking it’s still okay to come up to the Lake District for the day – it isn’t. People should exercise locally they shouldn’t get into their car to go on day trips to the Lake District because that is against the government guidance.It is of concern. The bit that concerns me is that people took the prime minister’s advice very seriously as soon as it was issued – I’m worried that the boredom and frustration factor comes into this. I’m worried that people had decided to stay at home but now a week, 10 days in may bethinking they’ll just get in the car and go here or there.Slattery said his force had only issued a “very small number” of fines – all for people who were “out without reasonable excuse and refused to return home” – and that enforcement was a “last resort”.Grants of between £3,000 and £50,000 will be available to sites already funded by the organisation, primarily to train the workforce in digital skills to help them through the Covid-19 crisis.It said priority will be given to sites where there is limited or no access to other sources of support, or where heritage is most at risk. The Labour MP and deputy leadership candidate Dawn Butler has shared that her uncle has died after contracting Covid-19 in hospital. In a post on Twitter, the Brent Central MP urged the government to test everyone who works in hospitals “without delay”. She said:My uncle had a fall, he didn’t have Covid-19. He caught it in hospital and has now sadly died from Covid-19.Just a few weeks ago we buried his only son. We are devastated as a family but I’m also angry.Government needs to test everyone who works in the hospitals without delay!In a video shared on Facebook, Dr Anna Chiles, a partner at Stow Surgery in Gloucestershire, has shared her family’s experience of Covid-19 to raise awareness of how varied the symptoms can be for different people and why it remains paramount to stay at home.Describing the variety of symptoms experienced in the family unit, she said: A few of us had coughs. These varied from a dry cough, but also a wetter sounding cough.My husband and I were both short of breath. We felt like it was like breathing at altitude, a little bit tight when we were breathing in. But the children didn’t seem to have any shortness of breath.Only one of us had a fever and a couple of us had some aching, flu-like symptoms and a few of us also had a headache.You can watch the full video here.In case you missed it... here is a video from the prime minister where he stresses that testing is “how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle”, as his government continues to face intense pressure over its policy.It came as Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of Public Health England (PHE), who appeared on several programmes this morning, admitted that “everybody involved is frustrated” by the low number of tests being carried out. He pointed to ongoing capacity issues and said the “core priority” until now has been testing hospital patients with suspected Covid-19. PHE has come under fire over this policy on wider testing of the public with suspected Covid-19. It has said repeatedly that most adults who develop symptoms will fully recover and do not need to be tested, even as the World Health Organization (WHO) was urging countries to “test, test, test”. Many scientists have disagreed with the PHE stance, saying it is only through widespread community testing that the UK will be able to track the virus and emerge from lockdown. At the No 10 daily press briefing yesterday, Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director of PHE, suggested to reporters the intention was to scale up this sort of testing: In terms of mass testing, the testing strategy is to increase the amount of testing done not just in healthcare workers but in the population. Single parents in Scotland have been stopped from shopping in some major supermarket chains after arriving with their children, as staff enforce strict physical distancing rules. One Parent Families Scotland says that support workers have heard of a number of instances in Glasgow, Dundee and Ayrshire where single parents have been turned away from stores - usually if they have more than one child with them – or asked to leave their children outside while they do their shopping, with Tesco appearing to apply the new rules particularly strictly.Satwat Rehman, director of One Parent Families Scotland told the : This just requires a bit of common sense. If someone is coming along with their children, it’s usually because there’s nowhere else for those children to be. Parents don’t want to expose their children if they can help it, and most are terrified of becoming ill themselves because there’s no one else to look after their kids. I can totally understand the need to get a balance with the new social distancing advice, but one in four families with dependent children in Scotland are headed by a single parent so there has to be a work around.A spokesperson for Tesco insisted that there was no blanket policy banning children from stores, and that, while encouraging people to shop with no more than one other person in line with government guidance, staff were being asked to apply common sense in all circumstances.Good morning. Following a week in self-isolation, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, returns to Westminster today and will unveil a new five-point plan for scaling up testing across the country, which the government calls its top priority. Hancock has recovered from a mild case of Covid-19 and will also front the daily news conference this afternoon. His plan proposes to boost testing capacity by paying private firms to carry out swab testing, roll out antibody tests, conducting randomised sampling of the population and building up Britain’s long-term diagnostic capacity by working with pharmaceutical firms. However, the government’s ambition of testing 25,000 people a day may not be achieved until the end of this month, while antibody is still yet to begin because none of the nine different testing kits ordered have been approved for use yet. The  (paywall) has the story. The government is absolutely lambasted across the front pages today, which includes a hammering from the usually doting : “Questions but no answers” accusing ministers of being repeatedly unilluminating on even basic questions about how the UK’s testing regime is to be increased. However, last night the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van Tam, maintained on ITV’s Peston that testing is ultimately a “side issue” when it comes to saving lives and maintaining physical distancing measures is king. ITV News has the full story. He said: What matters is slowing the rate of new infections. And the only way you can slow the rate of new infections, irrespective of whether they’re tested or not — it’s a bit of a side issue to be truthful with you — what’s important is the social distancing, stopping people coming into contact, so that the rate of new cases slows.Elsewhere, the ballot in the Labour leadership contest (remember that?) closes at noon today.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

While attention has understandably focused on new retention and self-employment schemes, universal credit delivering in the face of this huge jobs shock is the key to many families avoiding real hardship.”Bell said: “The scale of the claims means we should add hardworking civil servants from the Department for Work and Pensions to our ever-growing list of people to be grateful for. Their job in processing these claims and getting cash to families couldn’t be more crucial.”The DWP said it had moved more than 10,000 staff to deal with claims and was recruiting more.Labour called the figures “truly shocking” and urged the government to make the process more efficient.“The government must wake up and take action, not leave people waiting days to verify their identity and five weeks to get the support they need. Advances are not the answer to the five-week wait, they are loans that have to be paid back, and nobody knows how long this crisis will last.“The government should turn advances into non-repayable grants to end the five-week wait and make sure people get the support they need quickly at a level that genuinely protects them from poverty.”A DWP spokesperson said: “With such a huge increase in claims, there are pressures on our services.

That night it started to fall.“To my surprise, it did not come back,” she recalls of the fever. “My body finally began to fight it off and the next day they told me I could go home the day after if everything stayed stable.“I was so relieved. I had kept thinking I should’ve been admitted earlier and feared it was too late. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.”More than 29,000 people across the UK are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, and it is thought that thousands more have it. The disease has killed 2,352 people in the UK so far.Meanwhile, 174,019 people globally are known to have recovered. The number in the UK remains unclear, but heartening reports are beginning to emerge.“I actually got out of bed today, which is huge,” says 51-year-old Lou, in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire. “I thought I was dying Wednesday last week, when I couldn’t take a breath and was losing consciousness.”Paramedics who came to Lou’s house found that her temperature exceeded 104F (40C) and her blood pressure and oxygen intake had dropped. She was rushed to hospital along with her husband, who was also symptomatic. She was tested for Covid-19 on Friday and is still awaiting her results.In hospital she was put on a drip and given a variety of drugs, and her condition stabilised. She was discharged several days later as the choking feeling began to ease and her fever subsided.“It makes you think: sod bloody work. When this is over, we are having fun,” she says. “It’s baby steps, but we are slowly getting there.”Only patients with the worst symptoms are being admitted to hospital, and 22-year-old Ryan is among many whom 111 call handlers have told to stay at home and self-isolate unless they have severe difficulties breathing.“I’m very relieved I recovered,” says Ryan, a third-year engineering student at Imperial College London, telling of coughing red phlegm, exhaustion, night sweats and nausea. “I couldn’t get out of bed when the fever was at its worst. I lost my appetite and could barely drink water.”He says he is usually healthy and that the ordeal has been a big shock. Now he just wants to return to his home country, Malaysia. Jenny, 59, a former GP in Falkirk who has multiple sclerosis, isolated herself from her vulnerable family and has since been able to resume normal life.Although she is still quite fatigued and has to stop to catch her breath while walking through her village, she has now returned to caring for her partner, who is undergoing chemotherapy, and her father, who has dementia.Jenny stresses her desire to give people optimism about recovery and the importance of isolating if you have symptoms. “Every single one of us can make a difference in the flattening of the epidemic curve,” she says.For Ati, the episode has given her a new sense of community.“We started to see messages from neighbours, my GP and friends offering help,” she says. “It was so comforting to see how society comes together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80e0af27251214a711ed9ee2792fc3ff9a54e01/0_139_4159_2496/master/4159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab58157cde22ba18fbdd3d1896573c35","title":"uk coronavirus testing what ministers said and what stands scrutiny","story":"Science editor Ian Sample puts advisers’ and MPs’ claims to the reality testOver the past fortnight, ministers and their scientific advisers have made a series of claims over testing.

According to the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, companies are working flat out to boost their supply but are having to prioritise where the mixtures are sent.The reagents needed are specific, and different ones are required for different PCR machines – the equipment used to test for the virus by detecting its genetic material. Smaller companies are being consulted about other virus testing strategies. A better pandemic preparedness plan might have foreseen the surge in demand for testing materials and arranged to act swiftly, critics say.To add to the confusion, the Chemical Industries Association, which represents the UK’s very substantial chemicals industry, told ITV News on Tuesday that it had contacted its members who said there was no shortage of the relevant reagents.Reality: The government has bought millions of home test kits that can show if someone has had the virus and so, hopefully, developed some immunity. But no one has been able to say when the kits will be in circulation.At the end of March, Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England, told MPs on the science and technology committee that the finger-prick tests would be evaluated within the week, and that mass testing could start days after.The government later backtracked, saying it would be some time before the tests were available and that blood samples would need to be posted to a laboratory for analysis. The tests look for antibodies to the virus, not the virus itself, so cannot pick up new infections.

The reason is simple: a bad test could give an infected doctor the all-clear, sending them back into hospital to spread the virus to colleagues and patients.But some scientists argue that in the crisis the NHS needs to be more creative and relax its normally stringent rules. NHS test protocols demand specific equipment, enzymes and other chemicals, because these are known to produce reliable test results. But with those chemicals and other items in short supply, alternatives can be used to get around the bottleneck and get tests out more quickly.These tests will not be the gold standard the NHS prefers, but with proper evaluation, scientists believe they would be as good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbfde8dfc6100b17b163ecab0cfe9c1cd4ac2344/0_196_6048_3631/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ba70b2a12c8a122d4cf93a5bcfd326","title":"coronavirus and volunteering how can i help in the uk","story":"From lending a hand to local charities to bolstering the efforts of the NHS, there are many ways to get involvedThere are plenty of ways to get involved. Many local charities will be keen to attract new volunteers – especially as older stalwarts are forced to stay at home. Or there are national schemes, such as NHS volunteer responders. Some bigger charities, such as the Trussell Trust food bank network, have set up their own online schemes to match volunteers with food banks in their area. Local volunteer centres and organisations such as Volunteering Matters and Do-it can link you up with charities close to where you live. Reach Volunteering will match people with specialist professional skills, such IT expertise, to charities who need their help.The health service in England has put out a call for volunteer responders to help medical staff with tasks such as: delivering medicines from pharmacies driving patients to appointments bringing them home from hospital and making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home. More than 500,000 people have already signed up. More details are on the NHS England website.Keeping an eye out for neighbours and family members is the simplest way to help people who are vulnerable, lonely, self-isolating or busy key workers. Help could mean anything from running errands to the shops to providing a friendly voice of reassurance and support. Covid-19 Mutual Aid was set up to co-ordinate “good neighbour” initiatives and has lists of local groups in your area, together with details of how to help people safely.Yes. According to Shaun Delaney of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, exceptions to the guidance include people needing to travel to provide care to others. “In other words, people can go out to volunteer if they are providing help to vulnerable people or if their volunteering cannot be done from home.” If you are deemed high risk – you are aged over 70 or have underlying health issues – there are volunteering opportunities that you can do by phone or computer from home.Be sensible and vigilant. If you are helping out neighbours, please remember physical distancing rules: try to communicate by phone or text don’t enter people’s houses and always stay at least two metres away. Look after yourself, don’t go on an errand for a neighbour if you are ill or self-isolating. Wash your hands regularly.There are inescapable health risks from face-to-face volunteering and no guarantees that you will have adequate personal protective equipment. For this reason many voluntary projects, such as community kitchens and day centres, have shut down services. However, others are adapting to try to minimise the risks of infection through physical contact or close proximity. Some face-to-face befriending services, for example, have been replaced by phone or online alternatives.Yes. Charities both small and large have been devastated by the sudden drop in voluntary income caused by the cancellation or postponement of fundraising gatherings, ranging from fetes and coffee mornings to the London marathon. Those with high street retail outlets have also been hit by shop closures. UK charities estimate they will lose over £4bn over the next few weeks. Without cash, thousands of charities, including hospices, health and social care, and cancer support charities will be forced to reduce services, or in some cases even close down.The immediate focus is on charities that can provide emergency frontline support to vulnerable people affected by the social impact of coronavirus, including food banks and care organisations helping older, isolated and disabled people and their families. There are more than 14 million people living on the breadline in the UK, and they will be badly hit by the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Other organisations that need help include those providing welfare advice and emotional and respite support.One of the safest ways of giving is to donate to the National Emergencies Trust. This charity is co-ordinating the UK coronavirus disaster voluntary relief effort, providing a single online portal for donations from iniduals and companies. The money will be rapidly distributed in the form of small grants to recognised local charities via 46 established regional community foundations covering the whole of the UK.

Neil Mellor was going to be a Liverpool legend. The kid could not stop scoring. Before he had kicked a ball in senior football, Mellor was the subject of fevered chatter among Liverpool fans in the know. As a youngster he had breezed past every test set for him, first with the youth team, then the under-19s and then the reserves, averaging a goal a game every step of the way. As a teenager he’d broken an age-group goalscoring record held by Robbie Fowler – proof if it were needed that Mellor knew how to put the ball in the net.The only thing was, none of us had actually seen him do it. Today, any half-decent footballer worth their salt has a small anthology of goals compilations, uploaded online long before their voice has broken. Sixteen years ago, a time before YouTube even existed, a promising youngster was an open invitation for fans’ imaginations to run wild, fuelled by nothing other than terrace hearsay and spurious message-board posts. Unencumbered by the real thing, highlights reels were compiled in our minds and, sensibly enough, most Liverpool fans envisioned Mellor as a superhuman hybrid of Owen, Fowler, Rush and Ronaldo.That would be proved wrong in time – but not before it was proved absolutely right, and in the most glorious way imaginable. In November 2004, Mellor’s senior career was a couple of injury-hit seasons old, but his early stutters hadn’t quashed the hype. So when he was picked to lead the line against Arsenal in just his second Premier League start, the stage was set.The match itself was a thriller, marked by three goals of the highest class. Xabi Alonso struck first, latching on to a deliciously disguised layoff from Steven Gerrard to pick out the top corner from 20 yards. With the aesthetic bar set high, Arsenal promptly raised it a couple of notches, with Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira producing a whirl of one-touch passing that culminated in the captain dinking over a prone Chris Kirkland with Gallic disdain.Then, with stoppage-time ticking away and a draw seemingly inevitable, came Mellor’s moment. A long clearance heaved into the skies was half-cleared by Sol Campbell, and suddenly Mellor was haring on to a loose ball 30 yards from goal. He let it bounce once before thumping a thunderous strike into the far corner. Cue delirium. Match won, Anfield’s new hero sprinted off, arms aloft, to take in the adulation of the Kop. Neil Mellor had finally arrived, and he was here to stay.Unfortunately, he didn’t stay very long. Neil Mellor, goalscorer extraordinaire, scored precisely one more league goal for Liverpool. He only made a handful more appearances, and each one saw fantasy intruded on by cold hard reality. As it turned out, he wasn’t an Anfield icon in waiting but simply a busy, unpolished target man whose career was brutally blighted by injuries. He played in a stop-start run of games that winter before being sidelined for another six months with tendonitis. And that was that. He was loaned to Wigan, sold to Preston, and eventually forced into retirement aged 29, when the knee injuries became too much to bear. These day’s he’s a broadcaster for Sky Sports – and a very polished one at that, one of Soccer Saturday’s most engaging matchday reporters.In any sport, there are few things more exciting than a talented youngster. But just like how a great book will invariably make for a disappointing film, they often fare best in the mind’s eye. Mellor’s career was emphatic proof of that rule – yet he also managed to flout it, too, by delivering in real life a moment as good as anything we’d dreamed up in our heads. For one night only, Mellor gave us the best of both worlds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3aac59cb380a484e7595567ea6c424ed0929745/0_0_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a3d3a23b756896383c506bc2b053dc7","title":"10 of the best places to revisit after lockdown readers travel tips","story":"Some places stand as monuments to recovery, others inspire our readers with their beauty – or the wisdom of the ancientsTen years ago we were at Epidaurus, and each took turns to descend to the orchestra and read from Sophocles or Euripides – among the wisest writers of all time.

Things appeared normal until you noticed the cracks, jaunty angles and misaligned lintels. The spray paint from the rescue teams was still visible on shops the empty white chairs, one for every life lost, stood wistfully in the centre, and the beautiful cathedral was fenced off in disrepair. But the vibrant Re:start mall and its indie shops, chilled buskers, Lego-adorned coffee cabins and rainbow flowerpots were the first signs of the resilience of this bohemian city. In a time where we need to focus on recovery and a brighter future, I look forward to seeing what Christchurch becomes.Anna KennettSainte-Marine, near Combrit, is a stunning part of Brittany. We went there on a family holiday in 2017, driving through Normandy, staying in Honfleur and Rennes on the way. We rented a cottage about 500 metres from the sea and 750 metres from the village centre. Sainte-Marine boasts a beautiful harbour, a patisserie and lots of fabulous harbour-front restaurants where you can sip a glass of local cider, gorge on moules et frites and people-watch to your heart’s content. The beach is stunning, with amazing walks around the coast.Trish Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Make the trek up to the Piazzale Michelangelo, collecting bread, cheese and wine from the amazing market first. Then head back down to marvel at the Duomo, and walk the streets looking for the Medici balls on the buildings. No trip would be complete without a visit to David. Turning into the long room and seeing the statue at the end simply takes your breath away. Even in the crowded streets and the museums, you feel totally alone with beauty. CathThe area west of Lough Corrib in Connemara has some of the most breathtaking scenery not just in Ireland, but in the world. The Twelve Bens and Maumturk mountains provide the backdrop to myriad pools, lakes and rivers that glint and reflect the sky, lush greenery and brown hues of the blanket bog. Near the peninsulas you can find some of the most picturesque villages (Roundstone) and finest beaches (Doonloughan). As well as some of the freshest and tastiest seafood. The people are warm and welcoming and the Guinness is fabulous. PhelI’ve been all round the world, but found nowhere better than Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. It’s the Caribbean of the UK – white sand beaches, palm trees and no traffic. Just a short hop from Land’s End airport or a ferry ride from Penzance, so no queues or customs to worry about. See the exotic Abbey Garden with flowers from around the world, recently introduced red squirrels and the Valhalla maritime museum. There are five-star restaurants and places to stay, and you can walk your socks off or hop on a boat to one of the other islands. I just hope this remains as it is, a little paradise on Earth.Nigel KentI rented a lodge at Clachan Sands on North Uist with some friends for my 50th birthday. The views on to the beach changed every day, with white sand and myriad blues in the sea and sky. We were able to take epic walks, luckily mostly in sunshine, bought langoustines fresh off the fishing boat and had delicious meals at Berneray Bistro. Take a boat ride to the Isle of Harris, where there are more enormous beaches and the gin distillery. We saw sea otters, eagles, seals and red deer. It is the place to go if you need some big sky.Emma WellmanLast July, my partner and I spent two nights in Aarhus. It was booked as a surprise for both of us, and neither of us knew what to expect. It turned out to be the annual Jazz Festival. For a week, any venue that can host jazz in the city does. You wander from small bars to parks to libraries and take in the music. When you’re not bebopping, you can eat amazing Nordic cuisine. The most astounding thing was that the whole city got involved and just had fun. No bust-ups, just jazz. (And beer.) MichaelWhen all this is over, I want to go back to Eyam, a peaceful place of greensward and church surrounded by birdsong and chocolate-box cottages, and be reassured of what is possible, even after pandemics. I’ve been thinking about the plague-ridden villagers of 350 years ago, who wrestled with our issues of choosing self-isolation. And I’ll go back to the museum to be reminded of the local inventor of silk processes, Ralph Wain, and how industry and creativity can bring communities back to life after tragedy.

She could no longer leave her city – much less take a bus to northern Guatemala, to meet a coyote who would guide her through Mexico.“I had thought that only a hurricane could stop me,” she said. “But I hadn’t thought of a pandemic.”Border closures and strict lockdowns prompted by the Covid-19 crisis have disrupted the migrant trail through Central America and Mexico, forcing some would-be migrants to postpone their journeys – and stopping many others in their tracks.The result has been a deterrent more effective than any wall Donald Trump could build.Activists across the region have reported a steep decline in the number of migrants coming from Central America since the restrictions were implemented. One Mexican shelter near the Guatemalan border said it hadn’t received a new arrival in a week.El Salvador closed its borders on 11 March, and the governments of Guatemala and Honduras quickly followed suit. All three countries in the so-called northern triangle have since announced internal lockdowns of differing strictness.The three nations had recently signed “safe third country agreements” with the US government under which they agreed to increase enforcement on their borders, and receive migrants who had transited their country on the way to the US.Only Guatemala had begun to implement the new measures, but it announced on 17 March that it would suspend the deportations of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the US to its territory.But Guatemala and Honduras continued to receive deportation flights bringing their own citizens from the US – despite concerns that the practice could accelerate the spread of the virus. In the past week, a migrant who was deported from the US to Guatemala was diagnosed with Covid-19 and a group of deportees to Honduras escaped from the shelter where they were to be quarantined. Guatemala has now requested that the US suspend deportation flights.Meanwhile, migrants who were already en route have been left exposed by the closure of shelters and the difficulties facing humanitarian organizations which would normally attend to them.“They are in a vulnerable situation because the guidance is to stay at home – but the migrants don’t have homes,” said Dondé, who mentioned a case of a large group of Haitian and African migrants who were detained after crossing into Guatemala from Honduras amid the lockdown. “Neither Honduras or Guatemala wanted to offer them a place to stay.”Migrants who already had arrived to Mexico have been left in limbo by the US government’s decision to immediately return all migrants from Mexico and Central America who cross into the country irregularly along the south-west border.When restrictions are eventually eased, a fresh surge in migration seems likely: multiple would-be migrants who spoke with the  said it was only a question of when, not if, they would set out for the US.And the economic impact of the crisis may in turn cause others to migrate.. “Before many people migrated because they lacked work and a dignified life,” said Silva de Souza. “Now there will be many more.”Migrants who have come from even farther afield, have no choice but to try to push on. Mohamed left Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, in 2018, following the well-trodden migrant path via Ecuador, Colombia and the jungles of Panama. He was burning through his savings and racking up debt, but making steady progress north.But he reached Guatemala just before the government announced a state of emergency which has made moving on impossible.“Travel has become very difficult,” he said in a brief exchange via Facebook Messenger. But he was still determined to reach the US – even if he now has to move more carefully – traveling at night and avoiding large caravans. “With God’s will, I’ll get there. I will build a life of opportunity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b070e58bb09c99c83cb8e1827aafe3fdecb51885/0_151_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d766822efd78d1b5d391dcf2754fdc","title":"absolutely wrong how uk coronavirus test strategy unravelled","story":"Ministers shrugged off warnings a lack of tests could cost lives, until they were forced to change tackOn 11 March, the day before Boris Johnson told the nation that the coronavirus sweeping the UK could no longer be contained and that testing for Covid-19 would stop except for the seriously ill in hospital, the head of No 10’s “nudge unit” gave a brief interview to the BBC.At the time it was barely noticed – it was budget day, after all. With hindsight, it seems astonishing. “There’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don’t catch the disease,” said Dr David Halpern. “By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.”It was a window into the thinking of the political strategists directing the UK response to Covid-19, who claimed to base what they were doing on scientific evidence. We would let the disease spread among the healthy. So no need to test.If there was a moment when the UK turned its back on the traditional public health approach to fighting an epidemic, this was it.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.Ebola, Sars, Mers – in previous epidemics, nobody had questioned the need to hunt down and eliminate the virus by testing everyone with symptoms, tracking their contacts and isolating and testing those people in turn. But not this time.“You can’t fight a fire blindfold,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, just five days after the UK switched course in what sounded like an urgent appeal to Johnson, Halpern and any fellow travellers.“You can’t stop this pandemic if you don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case. If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in close contact with up to two days before they developed symptoms and test those people too.”But his warnings were shrugged off by government ministers in the UK – public health experts had been sidelined and a newer breed of scientist was in favour at No 10.According to Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, the dominant voices in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the scientific expert group advising the government, were mathematical modellers and behavioural scientists, including Halpern. On 25 March, Horton told MPs on the science and technology select committee that Sage appeared to have little input from public health experts and doctors, despite being chaired by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance. The clue for Horton was in the main papers it considered in advising the government of the strategy. “There is evidence on modelling and on behavioural science, but I don’t see the evidence from the public health community or from the clinical community,” he explained. Testing, isolation and quarantine – basic public health interventions – were barely on the agenda. Warnings from Chinese scientists of the severity of Covid-19 had not been understood.Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the WHO, also fiercely criticised the decision to stop tests. “For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy,” he said. “The basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling.”Less than two weeks on from the lockdown that Johnson announced on 23 March, the original strategy, the decisions that came before and after it, and the UK’s inability to ramp up testing for NHS staff – let alone anyone else – are under unrelenting scrutiny.Ministers have been flailing. What has emerged is a picture of confusion and uncertainty at the top, with ministers making promises they cannot keep and apparently with little comprehension of the global tussle for tests that may make it impossible for the UK to buy its way belatedly out of the problem. The UK is now competing with every other nation to obtain the kits it needs, particularly the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which tells someone whether they have Covid-19 or not.  has been told that presidents and prime ministers are trying to outbid each other to secure these kits and their components, which are in short supply. The US also has woken up to the need to test – and is telling companies that export them that America must come first.No wonder, perhaps, the UK now finds itself struggling to increase testing to 25,000 a day for hospital patients and health workers, let alone meet its ambition – once stated but now seldom mentioned – to reach 100,000 a day, to include other key workers. “In all countries we have prime ministers calling the CEOs and diagnostic companies to try to get hold of the stocks. Indonesia and Peru we know have offered to order several million tests and send private planes to pick the tests up. There is more going on behind the scenes to secure supplies,” said Dr Catharina Boehme, chief executive of the non-profit Geneva-based Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which is a WHO collaborating centre.The companies are trying to be responsible, she said. “They supply small quantities to each country to give sufficient supplies for a number of days and then ship on a very frequent basis. But there is clearly this move in the US where several companies have openly declared they can’t supply anyone outside the US.”Three US companies making the PCR tests, Abbott, Hologic and Cepheid, have been told not to export them, leaving Africa – which uses their technology in HIV tests – with a single supplier, Roche in Switzerland.The WHO, Unicef and the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation are working on procuring tests for low- and middle-income countries. There are global shortages even of the swabs, which are made by companies in just two countries, the US and Italy. In the UK, the testing regime has also been hampered by the lack of laboratory capacity to analyse the samples – a warehouse in Milton Keynes has been set up with the laboratory facilities to add capacity.In the long term, hopes are pinned on blood tests for antibodies produced by the immune system fighting the infection, which will show who has had Covid-19 and is probably therefore immune. These could be a game-changer, allowing key workers out of isolation, for instance to reopen schools.But another sign of the disconnect between public health experts and Downing Street became evident last Wednesday. Prof Sharon Peacock, director of infections at Public Health England, told MPs that millions of home testing kits would be available, delivered by Amazon or bought in Boots, within days, not weeks.“Tests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice. We are not alone in doing this,” she said.But within hours, Whitty seemed to quash the idea. He warned that antibody tests needed proper evaluation, which was being undertaken at Oxford University. “The key thing for us to do is evaluate. Are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?” he said at the prime minister’s press conference the same day. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government had bought 3.5m antibody tests, but the  understands the UK has actually put in orders for 40m more. It is the sort of drastic gamble that governments around the world are taking, afraid that stocks will disappear.Antibody tests are being used widely in China and South Korea, where the virus has already been beaten down to lower levels by the traditional PCR testing of those with symptoms and tracing and isolating their contacts.Mass contact tracing, which can be highly labour-intensive, is made possible through phone apps, which alert people who have been near someone who has tested positive.The concept was greeted with horror by some in the UK as mass data gathering and an invasion of privacy – yet Oxford University is now developing just such an app.Looking ahead to the endgame, testing and tracing contacts, figuring out where the virus has been and who is still vulnerable is widely acknowledged among scientists to be the way to stamp out the last pockets of a pandemic.For now, Italy is doing more testing than any other country, desperate to bring down its cases and fatality rates.Not far behind is Germany, which has been doing widespread testing of suspects with symptoms and contact tracing in the WHO-recommended fashion from the beginning. Its efforts are being led by the renowned public health body, the Robert Koch Institute.And while they are the first to say the pandemic is in its early stages and could yet explode in Germany, the rise in cases and deaths has not been not as sharp as in the UK and nowhere near the levels seen in Italy and Spain.It remains to be seen whether the new UK attention to testing can help bring the numbers down here as well. In a few short weeks, a strategy that rejected old science for new seems to have unravelled – and testing has suddenly become central to the fight against Covid-19.Testing is being carried out in hospitals, new and old, and in places such as the huge vacant car park of Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey, where every ride stands still. Under temporary canvas roofs, nurses in wind-blown plastic aprons, gloves and masks lean into open car windows to swab the nose and back of the mouth of healthcare workers, who may have the telltale dry cough, or are isolating because their child or partner has."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36bb1f94fd7c20755c97ce69cf104d318ba5e038/217_0_2446_1468/master/2446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4036c72b489f24f6fb1ec94acd187b4b","title":"life in lockdown how is your family coping","story":"The Anywhere but Westminster team would like your help to create the next episode of Life in LockdownWe’re putting together the next episode of Anywhere but Westminster’s Life in Lockdown series.

The move was roundly criticised by Orbán’s domestic and international critics.It was followed up by a bill of further measures published late on Tuesday evening that would target municipal authorities and mayors, many of whom are from opposition parties. During the state of emergency, mayors can take on the decision-making abilities of local councils, but the new regulation would submit these decisions to a review that could take up to five days.The move was immediately criticised as inefficient and unworkable, and later on Wednesday Gergely Gulyás, the chief of Orbán’s cabinet, said the government would not follow through on the measure.Budapest’s mayor, Gergely Karácsony, had warned that the measures risked increasing the loss of life due to coronavirus.“I think this proposition is dangerous not only for our democracy but it also makes the fight against coronavirus very difficult,” he said, in remarks emailed to the  by a spokesperson before Gulyás’ announcement. “If soldiers, policemen and Fidesz delegates have to decide on local government issues they do not even know or understand and have five days to do so, we are losing precious time in saving lives. If this proposition is accepted it could cause the death rate to rise.”Karácsony beat Orbán’s candidate in elections last October, standing on a platform of a greener and fairer city. Orbán’s party lost control of a number of big cities, including Budapest, in what was his first significant electoral setback for a decade.As of Wednesday morning, Hungary had 525 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 20 deaths. Opinion is ided on whether the country may avoid the nightmare scenario unfolding in many western European countries currently, due to relatively early restrictions on movement imposed by the government, or whether the epidemic is simply a couple of weeks behind and will soon enter an exponential growth phase.In a sign that even during a pandemic the Hungarian government has not ceased its rightwing culture battle, another part of the bill submitted on Tuesday would make it impossible for transgender people to legally alter their gender. The bill would introduce “gender at birth” into the Hungarian civil registry, in place of “gender”, and make the entry unalterable.Responding to Orbán’s power grab, Luxembourg’s veteran foreign minister Jean Asselborn said Hungary should be stripped of its right to take part in the EU council of ministers, the union’s prime decision-making body. “Hungary belongs in strict political quarantine,” he told Die Welt. “We cannot accept the fact that there is a dictatorial government in the EU.”The European commission has come under fire for its muted response to the Hungarian law that failed to mention Hungary by name. On Wednesday, the president of the European People’s Party, Donald Tusk, said the group would have to reconsider its earlier reluctance to expel Orbán’s Fidesz party from its ranks. In an open letter to the EPP - the centre-right political family long accused of turning a blind eye to Orbán’s excesses - Tusk said Hungary’s emergency measures were “disproportionate and inadequate”. But Tusk stopped short of saying that he supported Fidesz’s expulsion and was accused of failing to take a stand.Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53695156c6c5d9c0f1a53ec0f4a7dd6477965736/0_14_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8daebe74ac16742320209809f2e4581","title":"air canada flight attendant exposed to covid 19","story":"Gabrielle Wilson of Air Canada started feeling ill after flying back from Frankfurt.

Throbbing muscle pains cascaded through her body, accompanied by an “eerie dry throat” that she had never before experienced.Wilson, who works for Air Canada and asked to use a pseudonym, had recently completed a return flight from Toronto to Frankfurt and back. Accustomed to occasional discomforts caused by her job, she waved off the symptoms.“I’m not really a hypochondriac. I didn’t honestly think, ‘Oh my God, I’ve got the coronavirus’ or anything.”That evening, however, a fever had set in, and her chest became tight, as if “someone was yanking an elastic from either end” of her lungs.By the next morning, with her body weak and racked by chills, Wilson’s calmness had given way to full-blown panic.Within days, she was quarantined in the basement, but her family also began showing symptoms, prompting the grim realization that she had probably infected her loved ones with Covid-19.Wilson’s experience highlights what many in her profession increasingly view as dangerous work, as the virus passes between travelers and flight crews enclosed for hours on long-haul flights.And as borders close and governments advise their citizens to return home, Wilson fears that infected crew members – some of whom will remain asymptomatic – have become “super spreaders” of the coronavirus, potentially infecting many more.When Wilson first realized something was wrong, she resisted a visit to the hospital – worried she might be adding an unnecessary burden on to Canada’s healthcare system which was already feeling the strain of the first wave of Covid-19 victims.But she relented after speaking with a pulmonologist, and was tested for the coronavirus at a Toronto hospital. Doctors told her to return home and to remain in self-isolation as she waited for the results.“I had sleepless nights, which didn’t help me as I tried to get over the illness. I thought about my family, but could only ever see them through FaceTime,” she said. Her only real-world interaction with them was the meals delivered to the top step of the basement stairs.After six days the test came through positive, but by then, Wilson had learned she wasn’t the only one from her flight to be infected.Seven other Air Canada staff members – two deadheading pilots and five flight attendants – had tested positive for Covid-19 following the return trip to Germany.The crew had been flying a Boeing 777-300, the company’s largest plane. Depending on configuration, it can hold as many as 450 passengers.“We call it a high-density aircraft,” she said. “Ironic, I know.”The two pilots who tested positive had been sitting in business class. Wilson had been working in the back of the plane, on the opposite side of the aircraft.“It led me to believe that there were many people who were Covid-19 positive on that flight,” she said.Meanwhile, Wilson’s family also began developing symptoms – fevers, breathing difficulties and body pains.As she battled a fever and aching body, she was also overwhelmed by guilt – believing if she had acted sooner, recognizing the symptoms as the coronavirus – she could have spared her two daughters and husband.While the family’s symptoms are mild compared with thousands of cases that require hospitalization and intubation, the virus nonetheless also took an immense mental toll.“I only was trying to consume minimal media about coronavirus, because we’re all living it. But the uncertainty just eats away at your mental health,” she said. “For days, I couldn’t fall asleep. For hours on end, I was shaking and my mind was racing. It’s been tough.”In recent days, as more flight attendants and their families test positive for Covid-19, Air Canada has dramatically stepped up precautions on flights. In-flight service has been curtailed to minimize interactions with passengers. Flight crew have access to N95 masks and surgical-level gloves.The company also screens passengers for any sign they might have the virus – and will deny boarding to anyone displaying symptoms.Unions representing flight attendants say the moves are not enough, and say face shields and gowns are also needed. At least 14 flight attendants in Canada have tested positive for the virus and hundreds are in quarantine after suspected exposure.Wilson, who has been temporarily laid off alongside 16,000 other Air Canada employees, is skeptical of policies meant to prevent the further spread of Covid-19.“If I was flying with my symptoms, I would not have triggered any alarm bells. If you’re not heading to ICU or needing a respirator, you can totally get by with not showing any symptoms,” she said. “The headaches, the fever – they all went away with Tylenol and ibuprofen.”Wilson doesn’t believe – given what was known at the time – that her infection could have been avoided.She had worn gloves, washed her hands and minimized contact with travelers.But as new research reveals the efficiency with which the virus can establish infection, such precautions may not always be enough.“We got it from passengers. That’s a fact,” she said. “But now, we’re a part of the spread. We’re the super spreaders, as people frantically fly home.”The one upside of her family testing positive was that Wilson was able to leave the basement – if only to enter quarantine with her husband and daughters. Now, they are slowly recovering, but the anxiety seems likely to leave a lasting mark.“Whenever we all start to feel better, I read a story about someone dying and I get anxious again. I’m just freaking out,” she said. “There’s this overwhelming uncertainty over how it’s going to going affect the next person you know – how it might impact my sister or my brother or my mother. It’s absolutely heart-wrenching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaf963f92bc130e5b4d767d860dcaba3b2375bde/0_368_4220_2532/master/4220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=628afdd8161e50da036f782dc303d43d","title":"asian countries face possible second wave of coronavirus infections","story":"Daily numbers of confirmed cases rising again as people rush home to beat border closuresAsian countries that started to feel tentative hope that their responses to the coronavirus pandemic were bearing fruit are now facing possible second waves, brought by a rush of panicked people racing home to beat border closures and quarantine orders.As daily numbers of confirmed cases start to rise again, and new evidence of asymptomatic cases spark fear of unwitting community transmission, many have now brought in far stricter measures.Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor and Canada research chair at Manitoba University’s department of medical microbiology \u0026amp infectious diseases, said it was hard to know how daily life could return to normal until there was a vaccine and until governments know what the immunity levels are across the population.“The concern with this virus … is how to reduce social distancing measures and enforcement in such a way that you don’t reignite transmission chains for the virus and find yourself back at square one with trying to get things contained,” he said.One of the first affected by the virus, Hong Kong had already closed schools and some buildings and parks but never enacted a full lockdown.It has now banned foreign arrivals, closed venues and restricted gatherings, strengthened testing, opened quarantine centres, and handed out jail sentences for non-compliance. Tracking bracelets ensure people mandatorily isolating don’t leave their homes.Prof Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University’s school of public health, said that while Hong Kong could claim to have prevented an epidemic so far, there was still a risk of one with incoming travellers.Hong Kong never saw more than 11 cases confirmed in a day during the early stages of the outbreak. After thousands of people flew home the number is now regularly above 50, and the city’s health system is strained.Taiwan’s response to the pandemic is considered one of the world’s most successful. It maintains a ban on foreign entrants, and with its infection rate still low – around 330 cases – is more focused on a spat with the World Health Organization.Singapore has introduced fines and jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, banned all international short-term visitors and transits, cancelled mass gatherings, and closed venues, places of worship and tuition centres.This week it announced all long term pass-holders needed approval before entering the country, and cancelled the passport of a citizen who flouted stay-at-home orders.Japan’s daily case reports grew slowly over January and February, not reaching more than 50 until last month. While it has held off a major outbreak, Tokyo has become a concern, reporting record high case numbers for four consecutive days in late March.The country’s social distancing and lockdown measures appear far more lax than its neighbours and there has been accusations of under-testing and speculation the number of infected people is far higher than reported.South Korea was once one of the worst outbreak sites, but after implementing aggressive contact tracing, quarantining and isolation, it appeared to get control. Amid fears of a second wave, however, some health experts are calling for the country to extend its entry ban, currently one of the most lax in the region.In mainland China the initial outbreak, which killed thousands, has slowed but there remains concern over people who returned home from abroad and foreigners, all of whom have been banned from entering, including those with residency visas. Restrictions have been lifted in Hubei but across the country people’s movements are policed by a colour-coded health app.This week authorities imposed lockdown on a Chinese county of 600,000 after a woman is thought to have contracted the virus from asymptomatic doctors at a hospital.A study in the Lancet Public Health Journal said the extreme restrictions on Wuhan helped control the outbreak, and lifting them now could see a second wave by August.China’s national health commission said that as of Tuesday, 20,000 people were under observation as possible silent carriers, and the president, Xi Jinping, on a visit to Zhejiang, called for more focus on asymptomatic cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Spain’s coronavirus death toll rose to 10,003 on Thursday, up from 9,053 on Wednesday, an increase of 950.

Legislation passed by the Hungarian parliament on Monday enables the country’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree without a time-limit.Von der Leyen told a virtual press conference in Brussels: “I am concerned that certain measures go too far and I am particularly concerned with the situation in Hungary ... We are monitoring and mapping the whole situation but these emergency measures have to be limited to what is necessary and they have to be strictly proportionate because they have to be adequate in this situation. they should not last indefinitely and very importantly they should be sub to regular scrutiny.”The commission had put out a statement on Tuesday calling for emergency measures adopted by member states to be proportionate but it had been criticised for not making any reference to Hungary.Indonesia’s coronavirus death toll rose to 170 on Thursday as the world’s fourth most populous nation passed South Korea as the country with the highest number of recorded fatalities in Asia after China, reports Reuters:Indonesia reported a further 13 deaths and 113 new cases, taking its total number of infections to 1,790. South Korea has reported 169 deaths and 9,976 infections, according to the latest figures released there.The data comes amid alarm expressed by some medical experts and officials that President Joko Widodo’s government has been slow to bring in measures similar to those in other countries to curb the spread of the virus.Indonesia only reported its first case of the virus one month ago, but epidemiologists say a relatively low level of testing means the number of cases appears to have been vastly underreported.A model from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine would put the true number of infections in Indonesia at between 22,000 and 37,000.A model from the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford estimated the number as close to 80,000.Faced by fears that an annual exodus for the Muslim Ramadan holiday would accelerate the outbreak across the archipelago, Indonesia announced on Thursday it would give cash to poor families to encourage them not to leave the capital, Jakarta.Each year, tens of millions of people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation return to their hometowns or villages after the Islamic fasting month, an exodus known locally as mudik, which this year is scheduled to fall in late May.The measures announced by the government fall short of the ban on mudik that some medical experts had sought.Officials said Indonesians would not be banned from travelling, but would be required to undergo medical checks if they wanted to join mudik this year.The next EU budget should take the form of a new “Marshall plan” to stoke Europe’s recovery from the coronavirus crisis, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Thursday. Reuters reports:“We know in this crisis that we need quick answers. We cannot take one, two or three years to invent news tools,” she told a news conference, adding that the long-term budget, known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF) was its strongest tool.“We want to shape the MFF in such a way that it is a crucial part of our recovery plan ... Many are calling right now for something which is called this Marshall plan. I think the European budget should be the Marshall plan we are laying out together as a European Union for the European people,” she said.The Marshall Plan was a US aid programme for western Europe from 1948 to stimulate a recovery after the second world war.Spain hit another grim milestone on Thursday, as the number of deaths passed 10,000 and yet another record single-day death toll of 950 was recorded, writes Sam Jones in Madrid. However, while the total number of cases in the country rose to 101,238, the spread of the disease appears to be continuing to slow during the so-called “stabilisation phase”.“Over recent days, the number of daily cases has been slowing down,” Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa, told a press conference on Thursday morning.Illa added that the area around Madrid remained the hardest hit in Spain. The region has 32,155 confirmed cases of the virus and has reported 4,175 deaths. As France’s staggered Easter school holidays begin, interior minister Christophe Castaner warned the country to forget the usual “grand départ” or great departure, writes Kim Willsher in Paris. He said roadblocks would be set up on major highways and axes and extra police, gendarmes or soldiers dispatched to train stations and airports to verify the documents of anyone stopped out and about.Local officials in areas where city dwellers have second homes or popular tourist spots have also been told to check those travelling.The two-week Easter holidays begin on Friday evening and are staggered over four weeks and three different zones.During the lockdown, the French are required to carry a signed, dated and timed, attestation “on oath” giving the reason for leaving home. The document has a legal status.Castaner told those thinking of ignoring the confinement rules: “Absolutely do not go on holiday during the lockdown period … people must rest confined.“Any abuse will be punished. I know the lockdown is a constraint for families, but we must hold out,” the minister told LCI radio.Trains are still running across the country, but fewer than one in 10 services have been maintained.“When people are stopped and checked it’s not to fine them, it’s to guarantee and protect the French from the coronavirus and stop its spread. The objective is that people stay home,” Castaner added. “During the confinement, we do not go on holiday.”Since the lockdown began at noon on Tuesday 17 March, police and security forces have carried out 5.8m checks on people’s papers, Castaner said. They have issued 359,000 fines, now ranging from €135 for a first offence up to €1,500 for a repeat. Those found to have ignored the regulations four times can be fined up to €3,750 and sent to jail for up to six months.“I know how difficult it is to be confined for all French but Covid-19 doesn’t choose its targets depending on their revenue, their job, the holidays ... it hits everyone,” Castaner said.“If people start leaving for the weekend or the holidays, the whole strategy of the lockdown fails.”The highly restrictive measures Ireland put in place last week to slow the spread of coronavirus may well be extended beyond the initial deadline of 12 April, Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, said on Thursday.Ireland’s prime minister significantly ramped up previous restrictions last Friday when he ordered citizens to stay home and only leave to shop for groceries, for brief inidual physical exercise or make absolutely essential family visits.“I think people do need to realise that these restrictions may go on for some time. We’ve set an initial period but I think it may well be that we will need to go beyond that initial deadline, but again that will be a decision take with the best public health advice,” Coveney told a news conference. Iran’s death toll from the coronavirus has reached 3,136, with 124 deaths in the past 24 hours, the health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV on Thursday, adding that the country had 50,468 totol cases.“We have 3,956 infected people in critical condition ... There was 2,875 new cases of infected people in the past 24 hours ... 16,711 people have recovered from the disease,” Jahanpur said.Spain’s coronavirus death toll rose to 10,003 on Thursday, up from 9,053 on Wednesday, an increase of 950. On Tuesday Spain had recorded 864 deaths related to coronavirus, its previous highest figure.Afghanistan has reported 43 new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours, marking the biggest one-day rise in number of infections, reports Akhtar Mohammad Makoii in Herat.The total number of Covid-19 infections yesterday jumped to 239 from 196 – 41 of the new positive cases confirmed in western province of Herat. Health officials have also warned that the virus has now spread in society.None of new positive cases have travelled to Iran, said the health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar in a press conference in Kabul.The new cases push the total number of positive cases to 184 in Afghanistan’s worst-affected city, which borders Iran. Herat is under partial curfew in a bid to contain spread of the virus. Sixteen healthcare workers have also tested positive so far in Herat.In the country’s capital Kabul two more cases were confirmed, taking the total number of infections there to 18, including 4 in Nato forces.On Wednesday the Taliban said they were ready to declare a ceasefire in areas of Afghanistan under their control if they were hit by a coronavirus outbreak, AP reported. The announcement follows a UN security council statement on Tuesday urging Afghanistan’s warring parties to heed the UN secretary general’s call for an immediate ceasefire to respond to the pandemic and ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid throughout the country.“If, God forbid, the outbreak happens in an area where we control the situation then we will stop fighting in that area,” a Taliban spokesman said.The health ministry spokesman welcomed the Taliban announcement and also asked “all Afghans, including the Taliban, to get united against the virus”.Taliban have already started a campaign of information about coronavirus in areas they control.Afghanistan has reported four deaths from coronavirus. The European commission will propose to borrow €100bn against EU governments’ guarantees to finance a short-term work scheme to protect jobs impacted by the coronavirus epidemic, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. The commission will propose on Thursday to increase cash advances to farmers under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and provide more time for applications for support and for claims to be processed.Reuters reports that the commission will also propose to remove any national co-financing normally needed when countries get EU money to build infrastructure projects such as motorways, sewage plants or bridges, making the projects fully paid for by the blocThree-quarters of Britons said they experienced shortages of products when shopping in the week leading up to the prime minister’s orders to stay at home because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to research published today by the consumer group Which? The survey provides a snapshot of shopping patterns during initial panic-buying and before new rules on physical distancing led to supermarkets and other retailers racing to introduce measures such as restricting shopper numbers.Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection and food policy at Which?, said: “Millions of people have been experiencing product shortages in supermarkets, with all parts of the country affected. While many can adapt their shopping habits, it is particularly concerning that we are hearing from vulnerable consumers who are struggling to get hold of essentials.”Ireland’s lower house of parliament, the Dáil, will convene on Thursday but at least one party will stay away, saying the sitting is non-essential and a needless risk.The Labour party has said it will send in written statements and post video messages rather than join other deputies in the chamber to hear statements on health and social protection.Ireland has a caretaker government following February’s election but there will be no vote today on a new taoiseach, nor can legislation pass because there is no functioning upper house.Sinn Féin has said the chamber must meet to hold to account a government that has imposed sweeping restrictions and adopted new powers to deal with coronavirus.China reported six new coronavirus deaths as of the end of Wednesday, according to Reuters.Wednesday’s death toll was the same number as on Tuesday.China had 35 new coronavirus cases on 1 April, all of which were imported, the National Health Commission said on Thursday.

However, this is proving difficult and will take some time,” said the department.These applicants were encouraged, if they believe they are eligible, to resubmit their application on the MyWelfare.ie website clearly stating their last date of employment.The department said that if they are eligible, payment will be made as soon as possible. Any applications received before Thursday, a one-week payment will made the following Tuesday.The initial payment will be €350 and any arrears due back to their last date of employment will be calculated and paid at a future date.More than 35,000 employers have registered for the Government’s wage subsidy scheme set up to help companies who cannot pay their staff wages due to the pandemic but who want to retain links with their employees so they can be rehired when businesses reopen after the health crisis.Revenue received 35,830 registrations from employers as of Wednesday night, including 10,106 who registered in the two previous days.Under the scheme, employers will be paid up to 70 per cent of an employee’s take-home pay up to a maximum weekly tax-free payment of €410, which is equal to 70 per cent of take-home weekly income of an annual salary of €38,000.Employers are expected to make best efforts to maintain as close to 100 per cent normal income for the subsidised period. To qualify for the scheme they must show that they have experienced significant economic disruption due to Covid19 and they have lost at least 25 per cent of turnover.The pandemic has caused severe economic disruption in the State.The numbers receiving unemployment benefit is set to rise by about 300,000 in March to an all-time high of 482,000, pushing the unemployment rate to 17 per cent, Goodbody Stockbrokers said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4218809.1585810165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus westmeath has highest rate of covid 19 outside of dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOisín Carson (5) and Isabella Fayeun (6) standing near a Covid-19 notice near an outdoor gym that has been closed due to coronavirus restrictions in Athy, County Kildare.

Calculating the rate per 100,000 population allows for a like by like comparison between counties.The rate is based on confirmed cases only and does not paint the full picture of any particular county with rates likely to be higher in all areas. As of Sunday, 15,000 people were waiting to be tested for Covid-19 and about 1,500 people are being tested per day for the virus.\u0026nbspWhile these rates change on a daily basis, Westmeath has been among the counties with the highest rates over the past number of days and its incidence rate is currently 13 times greater than Carlow, the county with the lowest rate of Covid-19 cases, at 7 cases per 100,000 population.\u0026nbspWhile Cork has the second highest number of cases in the country (255 of 2,990 cases) and a rate of 47 cases per 100,000 population, Tipperary currently has the highest rate in all of Munster at 53.3 cases per 100,000 population.\u0026nbspGalway has the highest rate of cases in Connacht at 34.1 per 100,000 population while Cavan has the highest in Ulster at 47.3 cases per 100,000 population.\u0026nbspOf the 2,990 cases analysed by the HPSC, 48 per cent are male and 50 per cent are female, with 134 clusters involving 563 cases. The median age is 48 years old.\u0026nbspNorthern IrelandPublic Health Agency data published on Wednesday shows there are 689 cases of Covid-19, with 30 deaths across the North’s local government districts. An  analysis of the North’s Public Health Agency data shows that Belfast, has the largest number of cases (200) and the highest rate of Covid-19 infections of all local government authorities in the North at a rate of 58.5 cases per 100,00 population. Belfast’s rate is almost five times that of Causeway and Glens local government district which on Wednesday had a rate of 12.5 confirmed cases per 100,000. It is unknown what districts 39 of the 689 came from.

Photograph: AFP via Getty ImagesCovid-19 testing on samples taken from patients in Ireland is to be carried out in Europe, HSE chief executive Paul Reid has said.Priority cases will continue be processed in Ireland, Mr Reid told RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke.The decision to transfer some of the tests to a “reputable organisation in Europe” comes amid a backlog caused by a worldwide shortage in test kits.Priority testing will continue in Ireland for priority cases such as health workers and patients in hospitals.Additional test kits are expected to arrive in Ireland within 10 days. The reliability of Chinese test kits will need to be validated when they arrive, Mr Reid added.The HSE is also working with Irish pharma and bio-pharma companies and third level institutions to determine their capacity to “ramp up” testing.“We are in the top tier of the world in terms of testing. We are in the top five. We are working around the clock and are at a squeeze point now,” Mr Reid said.He said there has been a 1,000 per cent growth worldwide in the demand for the reagent used in testing. Contact tracersIreland has gone from zero test centres to 50, from 36 contact tracers to 1,400, a figure which will rise to 4,000 and from one laboratory to 19, he said. Mr Reid said he wants to get to the stage where there are between 10,000 to 15,000 tests being carried out a day, but that will not happen in the next week, he warned. At present 2,600 tests per day are being carried out.Using laboratories abroad to carry out testing will be significant, he said.Mr Reid stressed that the most important thing the public can do is to adhere to the guidelines with regard to hand hygiene and to stay at home. “It is so important.”Meanwhile, an infectious disease physician at St Vincent’s hospital has called for testing for healthcare workers to be prioritised over community testing.Paddy Mallon, who is also professor of microbial diseases at UCD school of medicine, called for a slowing down of community testing for Covid-19 and a ramping up of testing for health care workers.It would be more beneficial to keep more health care staff at work, he told Newstalk Breakfast.Although “a huge amount of work” is going on into seeking out alternative options for testing, “for the moment we need to accept we cannot do it right, so for the next week or two the focus should be on health care workers.”Prof Mallon said that if the rate of admission to intensive care continues to increase then that would not be sustainable.“We are now on a knife edge and the only thing that is going to protect the health system is the measures we’re taking.”He said further measures, aimed at avoiding new infections entering the country, may need to be taken if the situation deteriorates. BordersThere are very few countries not taking measures to protect their borders, he said. “The longer we do nothing the more concerned I’d be.”Immunologist Paul Moynagh has said that Ireland should be striving to increase testing for Covid-19 to 15,000 a day, a target he believes is achievable.Every positive case that can be identified will help reduce the rate of transmission, he told Morning Ireland.Prof Moynagh, who is also head of the Kathleen Lonsdale Institute for Human Health at NUI Maynooth, added that because so much of the infection and transmission comes from people who are asymptotic, it was really important to try to capture the level of infection in the community.Ways to bypass the current bottleneck need to be examined, he said. It should also be investigated if the pharmaceutical sector can provide support, so testing can be scaled up.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4218370.1585785148!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ff fg government would look to avoid return to austerity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil and Fine Gael negotiating teams hope a joint document can be finalised next week.

It had been assumed that Mr Martin would be taoiseach first in any arrangement but a view has taken hold among some in Fine Gael that Mr Varadkar should remain in place to deal with the coronavirus crisis.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together have 72 Dáil seats, eight short of a majority, and Mr Varadkar has said a third party is needed, as well as some Independents.Although talks are continuing between the two Civil War parties, sources on both sides say there is still a long way to go until a government is formed.On whether he or Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin would be taoiseach first, Mr Varadkar on Wednesday said: “That is something that is under discussion with Fianna Fáil but they are a party with slightly more seats than us and we recognise that but really I do not think anyone’s focus at the moment is on what job they are going to hold in a few weeks’ time or a few months’ time.”Fianna Fáil have 37 seats and Fine Gael have 35, and Mr Varadkar’s comments could be seen as an acknowledgment that Mr Martin should be taoiseach first.The two parties are attempting to agree a framework document and hope to then approach other parties and Independents seeking support.Labour TDs this week reiterated its desire to go into opposition and the Social Democrats say their policies are not compatible with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. The Civil War parties have ruled out dealing with Sinn Féin.The Greens reiterated their position on Wednesday that they want to pursue a national unity government. However, it is understood there was a discussion at the Green parliamentary party about what to do if this fails.There were differing views within the group on whether to engage with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Internal debate is continuing and party sources said the Greens would likely examine any document produced by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.National effortNewly elected Fianna Fáil senator and former TD Malcolm Byrne said the party should avoid “rushing into government” on the “basis that we support the national effort right now”. Mr Byrne won a Dáil seat in the Wexford byelection but lost it in January’s general election.“For the next few weeks, we have to put politics aside and all work together. We will need a government in due course but Fianna Fáil must only go in on the basis of a clear policy platform discussed by the parliamentary party and membership setting out our agenda prior to any programme being agreed. Rushing formation and presenting a package as a fait accompli will be wrong.”‘Gentle admonishment’Meanwhile, the State’s most senior civil servant has issued the Oireachtas with what is being characterised as a “gentle admonishment” to TDs over the Dáil sitting on Thursday.Martin Fraser, secretary general of the Government, sent a letter to his counterpart in the Oireachtas, Peter Finnegan, which has been forwarded to TDs.Mr Fraser highlighted that “everyone in the country has been asked to stay at home, subject to the limited exceptions which have been published by the Government”.

Senator Maura Hopkins stood down for family reasons and Senator Catherine Noone is seeking re-election to the Industrial and Commercial panel. Ms Noone became embroiled in controversy over remarks she made and subsequently apologised for about the Taoiseach and autism.In a letter to TDs, Senators and councillors ahead of voting, Leo Varadkar asked voters “to consider gender balance in how you vote. If you are not giving at least four of your 10 first and second preferences to female candidates, there is something wrong.“We need more women in our parliamentary party to better reflect real Ireland and we need more women in the Seanad to meet the 40 per cent gender quota for the next Dáil election.“If we don’t have more female candidates there will be even fewer slots for male candidates next time out.”CriticismThe party had already faced criticism when former TD Kate O’Connell was not selected as a candidate. Her sister Mary Newman Julian was candidate on the Cultural and Educational panel but did not get elected.Former TD Áine Collins is seeking election to the same panel, as is Cllr Sharon Tolan in Co Meath and Linda O’Shea Farren, while Cllr Emer Currie from Mr Varadkar’s Dublin West constituency is a candidate on the Administrative panel, to be selected on Friday.Meanwhile, four of the outgoing Senators on the university panels have been re-elected.

Photograph: Aly SongFile PhotoReutersIt is difficult to know the future implications of a moment in history while you are still living through it.But one of the most striking indications that the pandemic will be a historical marker must be the hints from Saudi authorities that they may cancel the hajj.The annual pilgrimage of millions of Muslims to Mecca and Medina, due in high summer this year, was not even cancelled during the Spanish Flu a century ago.A local newspaper noted the last time the hajj had been cancelled was 1213 in the Islamic calendar or “during the French campaign”, meaning the year 1798, when Napoleon invaded Egypt. The era-shaping nature of pandemics is evident in the language we use about them.“Quarantine” comes from the Venetian term for “40 days”, referring to the time ships had to be isolated before passengers could disembark. It’s a policy to protect port cities from disease dating from the Black Death in the 14th century.“Cordon sanitaire”, now mostly used to refer to the exclusion of unsavoury politicians, is an epidemic response measure. It refers to lining up troops along the site of an outbreak to prevent people leaving and spreading the disease.Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, a public agency that releases daily Covid-19 diagnoses and deaths, is named for the 19th-century microbiologist who discovered the causes of tuberculosis and cholera.In Koch’s time, as now, responses to epidemics were political.\u0026nbspAccording to the historian Richard Evans, economic concerns influenced the reaction of authorities in the city of Hamburg to the spread of cholera from the east after the British colonisation of India. The merchant rulers of what was then one of the world’s most important port cities rejected Koch’s theory that cholera was spread by waterborne bacteria, which would have made the case for costly quarantines of ships.\u0026nbspInstead, they favoured doctors who promoted the “miasma theory” that the disease was caused by bad air, which allowed trade to keep flowing and enabled the breakout of Europe’s last serious cholera epidemic in 1892.Efforts against cholera led to such modern conveniences as sewerage and water systems, and according to Evans, led to Hamburg becoming more German, as its Anglophile merchant class and their laissez-faire influences were reined back.Chinese century?Beijing sees the current pandemic as an opportunity to begin a Chinese century to supersede the American one.There has been speculation about such a shift for years, as the Chinese economy edges closer to becoming the world’s largest, regaining the position it lost to the United States in 1890.Seen from abroad, the United States appears not to have lost its global dominance so much as abdicated it.\u0026nbspIts leadership and healthcare system appear so incapable of meeting the challenge that some analysts have asked whether the pandemic could be the American “Suez crisis” – the farcical attempt to take back the canal from Egyptian nationalists in 1956 that demonstrated Britain was manifestly no longer the power it had been.US insistence that the disease be termed the “Wuhan virus” in a dig at China prevented the G7 economies making a joint statement on the pandemic. With US leadership absent and no other power apparent to assume the role, a video conference of the larger G20 could produce nothing more useful than platitudes.Some in the European Union dream the bloc could one day assume the role. But not today, because its nation states are too ided, and too many of them don’t want it to.It is too early to know how the pandemic will affect the reputation of the World Health Organisation, but there are grumbles about its hesitancy in recommending travel restrictions in the earlier stages of the outbreak.Though Taiwan has emerged as a model country in its pandemic response with early intervention that has kept its cases to 329, Beijing’s muscular foreign policy position that the island must be deemed a breakaway Chinese province rather than a state has blocked it from having observer status at the WHO.One thing for certain is that recent years have definitively seen off Francis Fukuyama’s 1992 theory that the collapse of the Soviet Union heralded “the end of history”, a notion that is now an exotic relic of the heyday of western liberal democracy.On the contrary, old cold war isions seemed to walk right out of the history books with the arrival of doctors from China, Cuba and Russia to help Italy in a fanfare of publicity before western countries could respond.In the world of ideas, austerity is decidedly out. Beloved tenets of market globalisation such as offshoring and just-in-time efficiency have been abruptly shown up by the fragility of supply chains for essential goods, from ventilators and food to toilet roll.And from big state intervention, to inidual sacrifices for the nation, to closed borders, a lot of retro ideas are back.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4218947.1585827060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"putin is crazy russian leader lambasted over us coronavirus aid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRussian president Vladimir Putin with chief physician Denis Protsenko during a visit to a hospital treating coronvirus patients on the outskirts of Moscow on March 24th.

We can provide emergency equipment needed to save Americans.”The US count of more than 216,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and about 5,000 deaths dwarfs the scale of the outbreak in Russia, where 3,548 people are known to have been infected and 30 people have died from the virus.Officials admit those figures understate the real size of the outbreak in the world’s largest country, however, and critics lambasted Russian president Vladimir Putin for exporting supplies just as the nation’s infection rate accelerates and medics complain of severe shortages of vital equipment.“I thought this was a stupid April 1st joke, but it turned out to be true that Russia really has sold masks and medical equipment to the US, at a time when doctors and nurses across the entire country are left without masks and infect each other,” anti-corruption campaigner and protest leader Alexei Navalny said on Thursday.“It’s monstrous. Putin is crazy,” he added.‘Humanitarian aid’Mr Navalny and the Doctors’ Alliance, a union of Russian medical workers, noted that the US said it had purchased the supplies from Moscow, while Russian officials described the shipment as “humanitarian aid.”“Well, that’s great. We are collecting money from the whole country to buy protective equipment for our medics, and our authorities are selling it in the US,” the Doctors’ Alliance tweeted. “It’s simply mockery.”When Mr Putin sent military trucks flying Russian flags to Italy last month to distribute medical supplies, critics accused Moscow of using the crisis to burnish its reputation in a country that has long been sceptical of EU sanctions against the Kremlin.Russia dismissed such claims, and denied reports in La Stampa newspaper that 80 per cent of the equipment was “totally useless or of little use to Italy”.Mr Trump described Russia’s offer of supplies as “very nice” earlier this week, when he and Mr Putin agreed to “work closely together” through the G20 group of states to combat coronavirus and its economic impact, and discussed ways to lift world oil prices from near 20-year lows.In a video conference of G20 leaders last week, Mr Putin argued for a moratorium on “restrictions placed on essential goods as well as financial transactions to purchase them”.Russia is also urging the United Nations general assembly to back a “solidarity” resolution on Covid-19 efforts that includes a call to halt all non-UN economic sanctions.Ukraine insists sanctions should only be lifted when Russia ends its occupation of Crimea and a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed 14,000 people.“When certain sides use the pandemic for political goals and call for the removal of sanctions, it should be seen as dirty manipulations and attempts to benefit from the suffering of millions,” said Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s permanent representative to the UN.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus positive: good news round-up - deer on our doorstepsNumber of people leaving the house has risen, latest survey shows amid fears resistance to coronavirus lockdown is growingCoronavirus latest news: Six-week old baby becomes \u0026#39one of the youngest lives lost anywhere\u0026#39 during pandemicCoronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK, how does it compare to other countries - and why is it important? Coronavirus lockdown rules Q\u0026ampA: can plumbers and builders still visit my home - and can police issue fines?Comment: After coronavirus, this is the next threat that could leave us locked into a less free worldPolitics latest news: Health minister Nadine Dorries contradicts Prime Minister as she claims more coronavirus testing \u0026#39is not a cure\u0026#39Best independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsClap For Our Carers: what time is the NHS applause tonight?Ramadan 2020: fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranComment: This nation looks to the Royals in hard times: Now may be the moment for the Queen to speak to her subjectsComment: Bureaucratic fiefdoms cannot get in the way of saving lives any longerWhy India’s coronavirus lockdown threatens to turn into tragedyAnzac Day 2020: how the Gallipoli battle helped forge Australia and New Zealand\u0026#39s national identitiesNew accusations against most senior Catholic official to be convicted of child sex abuseSt George\u0026#39s Day 2020: how the dragon-slayer became the patron saint of EnglandComment: The Government needs to show its working to justify its coronavirus responseAustralian student accused of spying in North Korean for taking picture of a toy tankCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: When will the peak hit and how many will die?

A carbolic spray makes the operation safe. Every one of the men hauling and cutting wear face foliage – beardage.Lister generally went in for the side-fuzz known from the 1850s as Dundreary whiskers, made fashionable by a character in the hit play Our American Cousin. (Abraham Lincoln was watching this farce when he was assassinated – surely another indication of the health and safety risks of facial hair.)Lister would have had something to chew on this week when doctors bravely volunteering to do what’s needed for coronavirus patients were handed shaving kits as they signed up. It’s because beards spoil the seal between masks known as FFP3 and the skin. Ordinarily, to expect shaving would be an outrageous example of everyday pogonophobia – a hate crime against beardies.Yet men who for 20 or 30 years had never seen their face in the mirror without the dignified covering of nature’s muffler have selflessly taken up scissors and razor. It is not to be underestimated. For men not afflicted with the facial fidgets – like David Beckham, who grows and mows facial designs as though he were using a Bazooka Joe instant tattoo transfer – beards are not just for Christmas. Martial figures, like the Cid of Spain, saw the beard as an emblem of honour touch it and you’d lose your head. That seems reasonable.And health chiefs are aware of the danger of religious discrimination in expecting beardlessness. Leaving the beard and hair uncut is kesh, one of the five Ks of Sikhism. Some Sikhs have preferred to die rather than cut their locks. Many Orthodox Jews recoil from the use of a razor, though, with the casuistry embraced by lovers of law, some allow an electric shaver as long as it acts as scissors would, and not like a razor edge.Peace to all such. I hope they find a way. My real gripe is with the widespread sprouting of stubble and careless beards through inertia. Just as it is no surprise now to glimpse an unmade bed behind a television talking head seen by Zoomery at home, so viewers are confronted with bristling patches of grey and ginger on talking chins. You can hear it rustle on the mike sometimes, like a cockroach in a bag of crisps.This matters because, after the Plague Year, the world will be remade, and the habits we’ve all picked up will determine how well it is refashioned. Some strive to insert the thin end of their ideology now, in order to make Britain more bossily state-controlled in future. But the unspoken ways of behaviour are the ones that really determine national culture.No one uses coins now for fear of germs. Will cash comes back? No one much dresses differently for work now, slopping about in tops and bottoms. Will smart dresses and suits return? This is the territory into which accidental beardism is thrusting its spring growth, like bindweed between the decking.I have a bearded dog in this fight. I last shaved my beard in 1976, after hearing an emotional performance of some Elgar. Little did I think, upon resuming its growth, that it could ever become fashionable. To see pogonotrophy creep on to a million chins by inadvertence is like leaving the carpets unvacuumed for the duration.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Dogs aren\u0027t necessarily deliberately hunting for birds, they bump into them and you can\u0027t take away the birds natural instinct to get away. If this happens continually they are away from their nests, the eggs chill and they are at more risk of predation.”  He said that skylarks, curlews, grey partridges, corn buntings stand to have a really good year this year.  This is because despite lockdown farmers are still doing their conservation projects.Fewer cars in the road means less roadkill, conservationists have said, meaning the lockdown could be a lifeline for hedgehogs, toads and other frequently-squashed creatures.Sue Patchett from the toad patrol in West Yorkshire told the Today Programme: Having the coronavirus, the lockdown, is going to have a massive effect on toad migration all up and down the country.   The main danger to toads is cars, but with coronavirus it should be so much easier for the toads to travel to their destinations. This year they will have a better chance of spawning.  Mr Swan agreed, adding  The less cars there are on the road the less wildlife road casualties there are for animals, hedgehogs and birds in particular get squashed on the road. Blackbirds, pheasants squabble at each other in the middle of the road and have no idea what the traffic is doing so they end up getting squashed.”  The closure of pubs and restaurants has meant a lessening demand for fish and seafood. Because of this, many fishing businesses are going out to sea less frequently or have paused operations for now.   The Marine Conservation Society said this could help our fish stocks recover.  A spokesperson told The : “It’s certainly feasible that some stocks could be subjected to reduced fishing pressure due to the drop in demand as a result of the pandemic, but whether or not that reduction is sustained long enough for populations to increase is hard to predict.  “There is no question that Covid-19 is upending the global seafood trade, supply chains and reducing demand on food-services such as eat-in restaurants.   “If we saw reduced fishing operations over the lockdown period due to Covid-19 and reduce catch volumes directly relating to this, this in turn could potentially impact some fish stocks status in the long run.”   The insects of Britain may be enjoying a brief respite from the tyranny of the trampling foot.  Matt Shardlow, the CEO of Buglife, said that oil-beetles on coastal footpaths are likely to do well as a result of the lockdown if fewer people are travelling to the coast for their walks.  He added, however, that he is concerned that movement restrictions mean conservationists will find it difficult to continue their work looking after endangered species, including reintroduction programmes. Mr Shardlow explained: “It is important that wherever restrictions allow we keep the work going that is enabling the continued survival of other species, and that enables us to assess the health of the countryside during this period.”Washing our hands more often may be hurting the invertebrates in our rivers, he added, explaining: “Anti-bacterial chemicals in handwashes can be persistent and harmful to the environment, an increase in the volume of anti-bacterial chemicals going through sewage works could harm river life.”  One bug which is likely to flourish this spring due to lockdown is the bumblebee.  The conservationist said:  “On the other-hand reduced economic activity will reduce air pollution, which will help bees find flowers – exhaust fumes disguise floral scents – and reduce the current damaging eutrophication of grasslands, wetlands, heathlands and woodlands.”   More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"numbers using public private transport increase first time since","story":"Britain\u0027s coronavirus lockdown began to fray on Wednesday night as official figures showed an uptick in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time at the beginning of this week.It is feared that the sunny forecast for the weekend, which could see temperatures of 20C in London, will prompt more people to go break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a rebellion if the measures are enforced for too long. Many self-employed people who have been told that they will not receive money from the Government until June now feel that they have no choice but to return to work, a Government adviser told The .It came as Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, said he recognised the extreme disruption to people\u0027s lives but warned that a dangerous second peak could develop if the restrictions were lifted too early.People will understand across the country why we have put these restrictions in place, and the Prime Minister was very clear they were for an initial three-week period and we would review them, he told a press conference. But what\u0027s also really important is that, if we stop these too quickly, there is a possibility that that massive effort people have made across the country is wasted and we could potentially see a dangerous second peak. We absolutely want to avoid that.Police-enforced restrictions on movement mean people can only leave their house to exercise, shop for essential items or go to work if they cannot work from home.Lord King said it was unrealistic to think the lockdown could continue for months and months on end and called for a gradual exit strategy to protect the economy and citizens\u0027 well-being.Data released from the Department of Transport – illustrated in the above graph – showed that after consistently dropping from March 23, when the lockdown was announced, the number of people travelling on buses and Tubes in London rose slightly on March 30.The numbers of those using their cars and vans rose by 10 per cent on the same day, from 27 per cent of normal levels on the Sunday to 37 per cent on Monday.Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, described the uptick in motor vehicle traffic as a slightly concerning trend.Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science which advises the Government, said people going to work still make up around 30 per cent of the trips outside the home.Describing the figure as quite a concern, she said that one group of people who are still working is the five million self-employed who will not receive any money until June under support measures announced by the Chancellor last week.A lot of them, because of their circumstances, will carry on working – they have families to feed and they have no money coming in and that is a really urgent issue,” Prof Michie told The .She also raised concerns that a lot of people were going to workplaces where social distancing measures of keeping two metres apart were not being enforced.Prof Michie said the Government now needs to get on the front foot and incentivise people to stay at home. We are only a week in and it is important to think about the problems that are likely to start as time goes on, she said. There are financial and practical pressures, issues of boredom, frustration, depression and for people living on their own, loneliness. Those things increase over time, and even more so for people in financially insecure circumstances.She said that as time goes on people might lose the motivation to stay indoors and as the weather gets better more and more people will want to be outside.Professor John Ashton, former president of the Faculty of Public Health, said compliance with the lockdown is dependent on trust and trust in the Government is fairly low because they have failed to be open and transparent from the beginning.I said from the outset that they need to take the public with them, but they were treating people like children, Prof Ashton said. If you want people to behave like adults then you have to treat them like adults and then they will play their part.He said that among the failures in the Government response to the pandemic has been a failure to be honest about testing capability and personal protective equipment and a failure to share data even among medical professionals.I think it is a danger that the lockdown might not stick, he added.Prof Ashton said that one way in which the Government could help enforce the measures was to roll out testing which would allow the restrictions to be altered according to need.However, the authorities on Wednesday night insisted that the vast majority of people are complying with the rules. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van Tam said: I know how incredibly disruptive this has been for people across the country, but these measures are essential to help support the NHS.Whatever the weather, we all have a shared responsibility to protect those around us, and the single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives.A Government spokesman said: Our message is clear – people should stay at home. This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. The restrictive measures the PM announced last week remain in place. Police across the UK have the powers they need to enforce these where necessary.A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said that they had seen an overwhelming response to the lockdown measures last weekend and are hopeful that the public will continue to abide by the rules this weekend.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia sends planeload medical supplies us","story":"A Russia military plane carrying medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) is en route to the United States after the Kremlin confirmed that United States President Donald Trump accepted Moscow’s offer of help.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said late on Tuesday that Mr Trump accepted with gratitude this aid of humanitarian nature  in a phone call with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. The US is grappling with the coronavirus epidemic, the total number of cases climbing to 189,000 by Tuesday.The Kremlin expects that the US would be in a position to offer aid to Russia as well at some point when US medical supplies producers raise their output volumes, Mr Peskov said.Mr Trump made a passing reference to Russian aid during a press conference on Monday, saying that Russia sent us a very, very large planeload of things.Reports of the US administration accepting aid from Russia have caused concerns that Moscow could be using the coronavirus crisis to at least get the US to ease some of the sanctions that have been imposed on Russia for its annexation of Ukraine\u0027s Crimea, its involvement in a separatist conflict in Ukraine as well as meddling in the 2016 US elections.Details of the Russian shipment remained unclear, however.Footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry showed a military plane full of cardboard boxes taking off from an airfield outside Moscow late on Tuesday night.The Russian military sent several planes with medical supplies and doctors to Italy last month. The Russians did not specify the contents of the shipments but Italian media reported that local authorities found most of them to be useless.Government critics in Russia have accused President Putin of putting his global ambitions before the country\u0027s well-being.Our regions are short of the most basic necessities, they’re running low even on face masks, opposition leader Lyubov Sobol tweeted. Putin lives in a fairy-tale world and plays his geopolitical games as the situation gets worse every day.Russia had 2,777 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Wednesday morning, with 24 deaths.Doctors across Russia have complained about a lack of PPE, and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said earlier this week that the city could soon run out of protective suits.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new accusations against senior catholic official convicted child","story":"New allegations of child abuse against George Pell have been made public for the first time, as the disgraced Australian Cardinal awaits the High Court decision on his appeal against convictions for rape and sexual assault.Pell, once the most powerful Catholic in Australia, became the church\u0027s most senior official to be convicted of child sexual abuse in 2018 when he was sentenced to six years imprisonment.On Thursday it was announced the decision in Pell’s High Court appeal would come next week. Earlier that same day, allegations of sexual abuse were publicly levelled against Pell by two men who had lived in the same orphanage in Ballarat, Victoria, as children.One of them, whose last name has been withheld, said Pell assaulted him multiple times in the 1970s.The man, using the name Bernie, said that as Pell rose up the ranks of the Catholic Church he became increasingly reluctant to speak out.“I would hear Pell\u0027s become Bishop… Pell\u0027s become Archbishop. Pell\u0027s become a Cardinal. Who\u0027s gonna believe a little boy from a home against that conglomerate? You know against that bloody goliath?” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.In March 2016 Victoria Police contacted Bernie as part of their investigation of a range of historical sexual abuse allegations against Pell, including two that ultimately led to his conviction and jailing.However, the other allegations, including Bernie’s, were withdrawn or dismissed when a planned second trial of George Pell was abandoned by the Victorian Department of Public Prosecutions.Peter Clarke, a second boy from the same orphanage - Nazareth House - told the ABC that Pell indecently touched him in the swimming pool near the boys\u0027 home.Many years later Victoria Police approached him but at the time, he said he “didn\u0027t want to have no part of this f***ing thing”.While Bernie made a sworn statement to police in 2016, he felt the psychological pressure was too great for him to proceed to trial. Now, he says he is ready.“I\u0027m not ashamed now, mate. No. It\u0027s not my shame anymore, George have it, George it\u0027s yours, deal with it. You have the shame mate. I don\u0027t want it anymore,” he said.In 2018 Pell was found guilty of raping one choirboy and assaulting another in his second trial after the first produced a hung jury. The convictions related to offences committed in 1996, during his tenure as archbishop of Melbourne.In 2019 Victoria’s Court of Appeal upheld the decision with a 2-1 ruling, and Pell sought permission to appeal to the High Court. The disgraced Cardinal, who received character references from two former Australian Prime Ministers, is now in solitary confinement.The full bench of the High Court is expected to announced their decision on the appeal next week.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/24/13/contactless.jpg","title":"contactless card payment limit uk increase","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Maximum spend per transaction rises from £30 in move to make it easier and faster to shopThe maximum contactless card payment will increase from £30 to £45 per transaction this week as part of measures aimed at helping Britain\u0027s retailers who are struggling\u0026nbspthrough the coronavirus outbreak.Shops are to begin rolling out the change from Wednesday 1 April, although it will be a gradual process to update software on hundreds of thousands of card terminals across the UK. The move follows similar increases recently made elsewhere in Europe.The British Retail Consortium and UK Finance, which represents the finance and payments industry, believe the change will make it easier for consumers to shop, giving a much-needed boost to retailers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt will reduce the number of occasions when people need to input their pin, speeding up queues – a change that will be particularly welcome in UK supermarkets which had their busiest month on record in march as shoppers stocked up on supplies.It will also mean more payments can be made without the need to handle cash, which should cut retailers\u0027 costs.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastAn increased limit was already being considered but the process has been accelerated as part of the industry\u0027s response to Covid-19.However, the benefit will not be felt for most shops until the government eases current lockdown conditions. Only shops designated as essential by the government are open as the UK attempts to slow the spread of coronavirus.Consumers spent £80.5bn via contactless payments in 2019, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, according to UK Finance.Increasing the maximum value on contactless purchases may cause concerns about fraud but UK Finance\u0027s figures suggest the amount lost is relatively small.Fraud equates to just 2.5p in every £100 spent using contactless technology. UK Finance said contactless fraud on payment cards and devices represents just 3.3 per cent of overall card fraud losses.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Reversing the increase would deny a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, including many in sectors such as care, retail and cleaning, who are on the front line in the national effort to tackle the virus.”Polling by the institute found that 66 per cent of adults last October believed the level of the minimum wage to be too low. Only 2 per cent said it was too high.Support for hiking the minimum wage was highest among young adults and low-income households.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The term it uses for the statutory wage floor for younger workers is the national minimum wage.The national minimum wage is £4.55 for 16-17 year olds in 202021, £6.45 for those aged 18-20 and £8.00 for 21-24 year olds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So are the authorities here doing enough?\u0026nbsp1 How have other countries responded to the coronavirus threat?The disease has spread to more than 200 countries and territories, killing tens of thousands of people, with the US, Italy and Spain recording more cases and more deaths than China.\u0026nbspIn its efforts to stop the deadly pandemic, the World Health Organisation has told countries to “test, test, test”.The world was stunned when China locked down first the entire city of Wuhan, and later the entire province of Hubei, as it sought to contain the virus. Such an enormous quarantine plan had never before been attempted in the modern world, but by the middle of March, Beijing’s decision appeared to be vindicated as cases tumbled rapidly, then stopped.South Korea, which was hit early with a cluster of cases, embarked on the world’s most ambitious virus-testing programme ever seen. By the beginning of March, the country was able to test 20,000 people a day and implemented stringent tracing efforts to track down people who had been in contact with those known to be infected.To date, South Korea has had 9,887 confirmed cases and 165 deaths, making its death rate 1 per cent, compared to a global death rate of 3.4 per cent.\u0026nbspIn Germany, 70,000 people a day are now being tested for the disease, and the death rate is under 1 per cent. A similar rate has also been seen in Austria where intense testing is underway.Even America, which under Donald Trump has been slow to accept the impact of the disease, is now testing more people per capita than the UK.Mr Trump even criticised Boris Johnson personally for the UK’s response to the crisis during a televised address this week.2 How many people are being tested in the UK?In the UK, the government has been accused of failing to prepare in the face of incessant warnings, and over the weekend failed to hit its own stated target of testing 10,000 people a day. Fewer than 5,000 inidual patients were tested for the disease on Saturday.Fewer than 153,000 people have been tested for the virus to date, according to figures released on Wednesday.The result is the government is now coming under even greater pressure over current levels of testing, as the UK experienced its biggest day-on-day rise in deaths so far.Ministers have said the UK is now aiming to test 25,000 people a day by the middle of April.3 Why are numbers lower than might be expected?Earlier in March, as the UK government pursued its controversial plans to only test people admitted to hospital, delayed closing schools, and banning large gatherings citing concerns over “behavioural fatigue” if too many restrictions came in too early, other countries and global bodies looked on in disbelief.When tactics changed later in the month, the UK found itself at the back of a long queue for essential equipment.Asked why the UK was only testing around 8,000 people a day while Germany was working on about 70,000 a day, Mr Johnson’s official spokesman said on Monday there have been difficulties in “getting all the equipment they need to conduct these tests at a time when everybody in the world wants them”.4 What does it mean for health workers?The lack of testing equipment in Britain has even meant essential frontline medical staff have been unable to be tested for the virus, resulting in those with\u0026nbspCovid-19-like\u0026nbspsymptoms being forced to self-isolate, when many of them may not in fact have the disease, thereby reducing the already critically low numbers of doctors, nurses and healthcare workers.On Wednesday, healthcare leaders warned there still remains “no immediate prospect” of mass\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspstaff testing.NHS\u0026nbsptrusts were told earlier this week they may only use up to 15 per cent of any spare testing capacity for\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspstaff.But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has now scrapped that cap, telling\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbsphospital labs to use all spare capacity to test their frontline workers.5 What is being done to increase testing in the UK?The UK is currently working towards a target of testing 25,000 people a day within the next three weeks.The 25,000 figure comes despite promises made last week by NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis who said there would be “hundreds of thousands of tests” a day within the next few weeks.Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, told the Press Association this week maximum testing capacity in the UK was currently “very constrained” and only able to deliver around 13,000 tests per day.The focus remains on testing patients in hospital to see if they have Covid-19, rather than the wider public.Public Health England (PHE) has also come under fire over its stance on wider testing of members of the public for the virus.The organisation has repeatedly said most adults in good health who develop symptoms will fully recover and do not need to be tested.However, many scientists disagree and say it is only through widespread testing the UK will be able to emerge from lockdown.On Tuesday, former WHO director Professor Anthony Costello criticised the UK\u0027s response to the crisis, saying the country does have the capacity to test hundreds of thousands more people.He said: “By mass testing, we can detect new outbreaks and there will be much less disruption rather than isolating the whole economy.“We have 44 molecular virology labs in the UK. If they were doing 400 tests a day, we would be up to Germany levels of testing (around 70,000 a day) and that is perfectly feasible.”He warned a rapid acceleration was the only way for the UK to avoid a painful six months before society “returns to normal”, as the public was warned on Sunday.“We must go to mass testing and, when we remove the lockdown, I don’t think it will take six months. All the Asian states — it was six to eight weeks of being able to lift the lockdown,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The mammals have been shown to be susceptible to Covid-19.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesScientists across the world are involved in fast-paced efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine, with the first human trial taking place in the US last month after skipping a stage of animal testing.But CSIRO said its tests would be the first comprehensive pre-clinical trials on animals, which it stressed were “very important” if the vaccine was to be rolled out.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe first phase is expected to take about three months, but human trials of Oxford’s vaccine candidate are also set to begin in the UK in the next few weeks.CSIRO’s testing will cover both efficacy and evaluating the best way to administer the vaccine for better protection, including an intra-muscular injection and a nasal spray.\u0026nbspOxford said its tests, involving up to 510 volunteers in the Thames Valley region, would “provide valuable information on the safety aspects of the vaccine, as well as its ability to generate an immune response against the virus”.\u0026nbspCSIRO’s director of health, Rob Grenfell, said any resulting vaccine would not be available to the public before late next year.“We’re still sticking to the optimistic 18 months for delivery of vaccine to the general consumers,” he said. “Now this, of course, may change.

The process usually takes one to two years.CSIRO chief executive, Larry Marshall, said: “Beginning vaccine candidate testing at CSIRO is a critical milestone in the fight against COVID-19, made possible by collaboration both within Australia and across the globe.”The Australian agency was the first research organisation outside of China to successfully develop a lab-grown version of the virus to enable pre-clinical studies on Covid-19.In February, its scientists confirmed ferrets reacted to the coronavirus as they shared with humans a particular receptor on their respiratory cells that the virus binds itself to.The first human trial of a vaccine to protect against coronavirus began last month in Seattle, where 45 young and healthy volunteers are to receive different doses of jabs co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health and drug firm Moderna.It will be between a year and 18 months before the results are known.The European Medicines Agency, which licenses medication in the European Union, said it has had discussions with developers of 12 potential Covid-19 vaccines.\u0026nbspTwo have already entered phase-one\u0026nbspclinical trials.Israel has also begun testing a coronavirus vaccine prototype on rodents at its bio-chemical defence laboratory, according to Reuters.Other scientists are trialling existing drugs used to treat other conditions such as Ebola, HIV, malaria and tuberculosis to establish if they could\u0026nbspfight coronavirus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At about 10 billion bacterial cells per cubic centimeter, they are vastly more populated than the average mud sediment on the sea floor, which is estimated to be about 100 cells per cubic centimeter.The single-celled creatures were discovered by researchers who took a decade of trial and error to try and examine the rocks deep beneath the sea. When they did manage to study them, they found that the cracks were actually a very friendly place for life, teeming with creatures.Honestly, it was a very unexpected discovery. I was very lucky, because I almost gave up, said Professor Suzuki.The cracks are formed when lava\u0026nbspis thrown out of undersea volcanoes, with a temperature of about 1,200 degrees Celsius. As the lava cools, it turns into rock and cracks.Those tiny breaks in the rock usually measure less than a millimetre across. With time, the cracks are filled up with clay minerals, like that used to make pottery, and bacteria then find their way into that and multiply.Clay minerals are like a magic material on Earth if you can find clay minerals, you can almost always find microbes living in them, said Professor Suzuki.The creatures found in the cracks are aerobic bacteria, that make energy through a similar process to that of humans, using oxygen and organic nutrients. But they are living in an environment that scientists expect to be similar to that inside rocks on Mars.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Neutral to slightly alkaline levels, low temperature, moderate salinity, iron-rich environment, basalt rock -- all of these conditions are shared between the deep ocean and the surface of Mars, said Professor Suzuki.The researchers now hope to work with Nasa to conduct a similar examination of rocks collected by rovers on the Martian surface. Possible techniques include scanning the rocks with a CT scanner, in the hope of discovering life lurking inside.This discovery of life where no one expected it in solid rock below the\u0026nbspseafloor\u0026nbspmay be changing the game for the search for life in space, said Professor\u0026nbspSuzuki in a statement.Though the article describing the discovery is published today, the rock samples that prompted it were collected in 2010. They came from a drilling programme that extended a huge metal tube from a research ship, digging down beneath the seafloor and bringing up samples from the sediment and rock that is underneath.They gathered rock samples that were\u0026nbsp13.5 million, 33.5 million and 104 million years old.Importantly, the rocks were not taken from\u0026nbspnearby any vents or water channels that might have pushed bacteria from elsewhere into the cracks. That allows the researchers to be confident that they had arrived in the cracks independently.Initial examination of the rocks found none of the bacteria that Professor Suzuki hoped to discover inside. But the breakthrough came when the team were able to slice of thin sheets of the rock, stain them with a special dye that lights up any DNA, and look at them through a microscope.They saw the bacteria living inside as glowing green spheres that had been tightly packed into glowing orange tunnels. The orange glow was the clay mineral deposits that made the cracks such an attractive place to live for the creatures that stayed there.The paper, \u0027Deep microbial proliferation at the basalt interface in 33.5-104 million-year-old oceanic crust\u0027, is published today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nasa plans to send the first woman and next man to the lunar surface in 2024, and establish a Moon base by 2028. That work will lay the foundations for sending humans to Mars in the 2030s.“We’ve entered a bold new era of space exploration with the Artemis program, and we are thrilled to see so many incredible Americans apply to join us,” said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbspin a statement.“The next class of Artemis Generation astronauts will help us explore more of the Moon than ever before and lead us to the Red Planet.”The call had seen applicants from every US state as well as the District of Columbia and four US territories.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It is surpassed only by the record of 18,000 applicants set for the recent class of astronauts, who graduated at the beginning of this year.The agency said that the large application fields allowed it to choose the best astronauts it could.“We’re able to build such a strong astronaut corps at NASA because we have such a strong pool of applicants to choose from,” said Anne\u0026nbspRoemer, manager of the Astronaut Selection Board and director of human resources at Johnson.“It’s always amazing to see the ersity of education, experience and skills that are represented in our applicants. We are excited to start reviewing astronaut applications to identify the next class of astronaut candidates.”Since the 1960s, some 350 people have been chosen to train as astronaut candidates.

Reversing the increase would deny a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, including many in sectors such as care, retail and cleaning, who are on the front line in the national effort to tackle the virus.”Polling by the institute found that 66 per cent of adults last October believed the level of the minimum wage to be too low. Only 2 per cent said it was too high.Support for hiking the minimum wage was highest among young adults and low-income households.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The term it uses for the statutory wage floor for younger workers is the national minimum wage.The national minimum wage is £4.55 for 16-17 year olds in 202021, £6.45 for those aged 18-20 and £8.00 for 21-24 year olds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We’re determined to keep getting food out there.“The number of people in need is much greater now, but we’re set up to do a lot more than we used to. And the Help The Hungry campaign is certainly helping get us plenty of traction and offers of help.”How to support our campaignPrior to the pandemic, The Felix Project had been picking up surplus food from restaurants, caterers and manufacturers and delivering it to around 600 food banks, care homes, school providers and other charities.“Some of the charities are\u0026nbspeither closing or having to reduce what they can do,” said Mr Curtin. “We are still getting food to all those that are still operating, and all those trying to get supplies to people’s homes in different ways.”Responding to the enormous scale of the current crisis, The Felix Project has joined forces with two other large food surplus charities – City Harvest and FareShare – to create the London Food Alliance.And to make sure food redistribution is as efficient as possible, the alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, centralised community hubs are well-stocked with surplus food.The Felix Project’s pool of volunteers has gone up to around 75 people, and Renault have provided the charity with six new vans. Mr Curtin said he would like to get hold of more vehicles\u0026nbspwith refrigerators inside – and is also looking for more volunteer drivers. “That would make a massive difference,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is also inviting everyone struggling because of job losses or a sudden drop in income to register with them for help.“The small, local groups have done brilliant work, but we need to co-ordinate so that we made sure absolutely everyone who is in a vulnerable position is picked up,” said Ms Caliskan. “The Felix Project works right across London, so it’s been a great partner.”Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was the first of the community hubs to open on Monday, as Haringey council staff and volunteers began getting surplus food out to vulnerable people in the borough.Rachel Ledwith, FareShare’s development manager in London, said her organisation and the others in the alliance were speaking to each other at a daily 11.30am phone call to co-ordinate deliveries across the capital.“We’re ready to get a high volume of food into the hubs, and all the boroughs are reacting as fast as they can to get things up and running,” she said.Ms\u0026nbspLedwith\u0026nbspadded: “There’s been a tsunami of food coming from the hospitality and catering sector. We’re also seeing the large manufacturers and retailers donate more, as well as providing us with surplus food.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“What’s important next is that we work closely with the food industry to ensure the current volumes of food we’re accessing remain sustainable, as we know demand from our charity network will only continue increasing over the coming weeks.”The encouraging developments come as the total raised by our Help The Hungry appeal, in conjunction with our sister title the\u0026nbspEvening Standard, leapt by £300,000 in 24 hours to £850,000.We are also asking food aid charities across the UK to contact us using the email helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and what problems you are facing right now.You can help us build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations.

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But they were being very naughty.”The following day, Mr Stuart noted the goats were “back, and gathering in groups of more than two”.He continued to document the goats’ movements throughout the weekend, eventually writing a post echoed by many, declaring: “I, for one, welcome our new goat overlords.”“Growing up in Llandudno, I always knew the Great Orme mountain goats would be ones to take over in the event of any future apocalyptic dystopia,” said Jeanna Skinner, writing on Twitter.\u0026nbspAnother Twitter user wrote: “And so it came to pass that the Great Orme goats captured Llandudno and all who saw them did tremble at their might.”While the goats are fairly regular uninvited guests in the town,\u0026nbsphaving even faced a cull in the 1990s,\u0026nbspthere appears to be a general consensus that\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbsphas encouraged them to roam further\u0026nbspthan usual.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They usually only come down from the Great Orme when it’s windy, and only the backstreets at the top of Mostyn Street. Now lockdown means it’s empty, they’re going further than ever.”The goats of Llandudno are not the only animals taking advantage of the absence of humans to venture more often into\u0026nbsptypically bustling towns and cities.Wild boars have been spotted in Barcelona, ducks were filmed\u0026nbspstraying\u0026nbspfrom the Seine to roam the streets of Paris,\u0026nbspand a puma was captured by authorities in the Chilean capital, Santiago.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“There isn’t anything definitively in the legislation that talks about whether people can get in a car to drive to a place and do their exercise.”Guidance issued to officers by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and College of Police urged them to “use your judgement and common sense”.It added: “People will want to exercise locally and may need to travel to do so —\u0026nbspwe don’t want the public sanctioned for travelling a reasonable distance to exercise. Road checks on every vehicle is equally disproportionate.”A legal firm routinely instructed\u0026nbspby police forces, 5 Essex Court, said in its own guidance that “there is no requirement that physical exercise must be carried out in the immediate vicinity of the home”.Leaving your homeBefore the lockdown was announced, Boris Johnson called for people to avoid non-essential travel, but the law does not define the phrase.Instead, it states that: “During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.”The restriction does not apply to homeless people, or those —\u0026nbspsuch as domestic violence or child abuse victims —\u0026nbspwho leave home to avoid injury or “escape the risk of harm”.Police told to arrest public for breaking lockdown as ‘last resort’The “place where they are living” includes gardens, yards, passages, stairways, garages and outhouses.The law provides a long list of “reasonable excuses”, which is not exhaustive.If someone is challenged by the police, they can provide any reason for being outside that will be considered on a case-by-case basis.The examples given in the legislation include obtaining “basic necessities”, including food and medical supplies for the household, or for vulnerable people.You can also obtain money, take exercise, seek medical assistance, provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, donate blood, attend a funeral, go to court or access public services like schools and welfare.The law says people may travel for work or volunteering “where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work, or to provide those services, from the place where they are living”.Children are allowed to travel or be transported between the homes of separated parents or s.The law also allows people to “move house where reasonably necessary”.The law has enforced the closure of numerous shops that are deemed non-essential, such as clothing retailers.But —\u0026nbspdespite isolated reports of shops being told not to sell Easter eggs by council officers —\u0026nbspthere is no legal restriction on what remaining shops can sell.Although the law describes “obtaining basic necessities” as a reason to leave home, police leaders have not expressed an intention to check what people are buying.The law bans public gatherings of more than two people, except in specific circumstances.Such gatherings are not illegal when the people are “members of the same household”, i.e. a family that lives together, cohabiting couples or housemates.Gatherings are also permitted if they are “essential for work purposes”, to provide care to a vulnerable person, emergency assistance, take part in legal proceedings, attend a funeral or where “reasonably necessary”, such as when moving house.The law has forced the closure of pubs, restaurants, cafes, gyms, cinemas, clubs, museums, spas, betting shops and other businesses that are deemed non-essential and bring people together in a way that could spread the virus.Food retailers, off licences, pharmacies, newsagents, homeware and hardware shops, petrol stations and vehicle repair services are allowed to remain open.Also allowed to continue work are taxi and vehicle hire businesses, banks, post offices, funeral directors, laundrettes and dry cleaners, dentists, opticians and other health-related services.Veterinary surgeons and pet shops have not been forced to close.Restaurants and pubs are able to operate as takeaways as long as no one eats or drinks on the premises, and shops are allowed to run delivery services.Police and local councils can enforce closures with prohibition notices and fines.The Welsh law additionally states that retailers should take “all reasonable measures to ensure that a distance of two metres is maintained between any person on the business premises”.Police leaders have instructed officers to use fines and arrests as a “last resort” and first encourage members of the public to follow restrictions on movement and gatherings voluntarily.“We should reserve enforcement only for iniduals who have not responded to engage, explain, and encourage, where public health is at risk,” official guidance states.But there are two laws enabling police to arrest people for coronavirus-related offences –\u0026nbspthe Coronavirus Act 2020 and Health Protection Regulations 2020.Woman fined £660 for failing to give police name or reasons for travelThe first law gives police the power to direct any “potentially infected person” to go home, to a medical facility or to a testing location.Under schedule 21 of the Coronavirus Act 2020, it is illegal to fail to comply with the instructions of police officers without reasonable excuse, or obstruct them in the course of their duties.Offences can be punished by fines of up to £1,000 on summary conviction in a magistrates’ court.Most provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020 will expire after two years, but it may be reviewed, extended or changed by parliament.The separate Health Protection Regulations 2020 came into force in England on 26 March and enforce the terms of the lockdown.The law – which will expire in six months – allows police to instruct people violating it to go home, leave an area or disperse, and to ensure parents stop their children from breaking the rules.Police given power to arrest people for breaking coronavirus rulesIt is an offence to violate restrictions on businesses, movement and gatherings without “reasonable excuse”, fail to comply with police instructions or to obstruct officials enforcing the measures.Any adults who commit an offence under the new regulations can be handed £60 fines, reduced to £30 if payment is made within two weeks.But if anyone has been fined for breaking the coronavirus lockdown before, the fine will be doubled to a maximum of £960.People will not be convicted of an offence if they pay the money within 28 days, after which enforcement action will start.“Iniduals who do not pay a fixed penalty notice under the regulations could be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose unlimited fines,” a Home Office spokesperson said.“If an inidual continues to refuse to comply, they will be acting unlawfully, and the police may arrest them where deemed proportionate and necessary.“However, in the first instance the police will always apply their common sense and discretion.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These would later be delivered to the doorsteps of poor, elderly and vulnerable residents of Haringey, as identified on the council’s database, as well as to the homes of local children eligible for free school meals.Spurs chair\u0026nbspDaniel Levy said: “As a club, we have always been clear about our commitment to the wider community — and never has this been more important than it is now. We are immensely proud of the efforts of everybody involved in the fight against Covid-19 and see today as just the start of what we can do as a club to assist.”How to support our campaignA Haringey council spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid 150 of the borough’s most vulnerable families would have got food parcels delivered yesterday. Production will be ramped up from today to several thousand food parcels daily.The packers are council employees transferred from non-priority services and volunteers from Edible London, a local charity tackling food poverty.A second Haringey hub, located at Alexandra Palace,\u0026nbspalso became operational yesterday, and will be used to supply food to borough residents with severe underlying health problems in self-isolation as part of the government’s Covid-19 “shielded” category.Joseph Ejiofor, leader of Haringey council, said: “I’m inspired by the generosity of our community who have stepped up to help so quickly. We have staff and volunteers working tirelessly at our two food redistribution centres, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Alexandra Palace, alongside our voluntary sector partners, Edible London.“Working together we’re ensuring food gets to households who need it most.

The outcomes are now being seenTwo weeks into social distancing and early data has indicated San Francisco\u0027s coronavirus curve could be flattening.Prior to the regulations, the Bay Area officials were concerned with how Covid-19 infections would impact the community.San Francisco Mayor London Breed and five mayors in the surrounding Bay Area issued a stay-at-home order on 16 March in response to concerns, an unprecedented move at the time. Then California Governor Gavin Newsom quickly followed his city mayors by ordering a statewide state-at-home order to the nearly 40m residents.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn\u0026nbspNew York, by\u0026nbspcomparison, the current US epicentre for the pandemic, Governor Andrew Cuomo waited to issue a stay-at-home order. It went into effect almost a week later on 22 March. This order was in partnership with Connecticut and New Jersey to help combat the spread of the virus.Now San Francisco has only 374 cases and six people have died from the novel virus. In the 10 Bay Area counties, there have been more than 2,200 confirmed cases and 57 deaths. Comparatively, New York City has 43,139 cases and 932 deaths, as of Tuesday. Authorities warn that this death toll will go up.So was it\u0026nbspthe early intervention\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspCalifornia officials that helped\u0026nbspflatten the curve on the west coast?Potentially, but Dr George Rutherford, professor and epidemiology \u0026amp biostatistics\u0026nbspdirector at the University of California, San Francisco, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent it is\u0026nbsptoo early for the Bay Area to determine if the curve is actually flattening.Our official line is it is too soon to call. It could all go south tomorrow, he said.One factor that contributed to government officials closing down San Francisco early is it is\u0026nbspthe densest and oldest county, with more people over the age of 65 compared to the rest of California.Dr Robyn Gershon, clinical professor of epidemiology at NYU School of Global Public Health, also said the county had early warning signs of how the virus could be spreading in the US.San Francisco had a little bit of early warning because they are so close to the Asian countries, she said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWarning signs also came from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which sailed just outside San Francisco for days before it was able to dock on 10 March. Companies like Apple and Google, both based in Silicon Valley, allowed their employees to stay home starting as early as 5 March.While this was all happening, millions of people every day were still taking the New York City subway and bus systems, which Dr Gershon said potentially aided the exponential spread in Manhattan.I think what really helped them is that (San Francisco) doesn\u0027t have mass transit, the epidemiologist said. New York City has kept open the mass transit because so many depend on it.It is very easy to spread, Dr Gershon added. It seems to spread from one person to three.When comparing New York City and San Francisco, similarities include both having high rates of a vulnerable elderly population, homeless people, and people living below the poverty line. These variables can contribute to each city getting hit harder with the virus compared to other parts of the US. But San Francisco isn\u0027t seeing quite the same hit.We are way outstripping them, Dr Gershon said about the number of cases and hospitalisations in New York City, adding: When you think of San Francisco and the counties, yeah they have a lot of people but in San Francisco ... it is not dense. It\u0027s not the dense close living that we have here.Dr Jeremy Greene, professor and director of the Institute of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, warned against comparing New York City and San Francisco based on how quickly regulations were put in place.I think that it\u0027s a dangerous game to compare the differential epidemic in New York City in San Francisco, he said. Yes, we know that California did put into place shelter-in-place orders earlier than New York ... but I don\u0027t believe that the difference that we are seeing between New York and San Francisco can be attributed to a political will-to-action.Covid-19 differs from that of influenza because people show little to no symptoms for weeks after first being infected.While we have earlier evidence of community spread in California over New York, we have no reason to believe that is the truth of the epidemiology, Dr Greene added. Coronavirus could\u0027ve been spreading in the New York area for far longer and clearly spreading in a denser capacity.EU says Trump\u0027s \u0027miracle\u0027 malaria drug \u0027has not been proved\u0027 effective\u0027It’s like being on eBay\u0027: Cuomo attacks US healthcare as coronavirus Fossil fuels should have cigarette-style warnings, health experts sayLouisiana sees large surge in coronavirus casesThe number of cases in every\u0026nbspcity and state has not been the most reliable factor when determining how Covid-19 has impacted the area because of the lack of testing capabilities in different parts of the US.Unlike influenza - where the disease manifests and it is clearly influenza - coronavirus is so silent that in the absence of a robust testing form, we\u0027re operating blind, Dr Greene said. The United States had several opportunities to aggressively ramp up and employ proper screening mechanisms on a level that South Korea deployed, and we failed to do so. And at this point we have no capacity to do so.In New York City, 89,197 residents have received tests for Covid-19 and more than 200,000 people in the state. California, in comparison, has only tested 89,600, as of last week. But case numbers in each area could be exponentially higher given how silent Covid-19 symptoms are in carriers.Hospitalisations and death rates are stronger indicators on how the virus has impacted communities, but even that data can be flawed in understanding the true level of the pandemic.The ICU hospitalisations are higher than we would\u0027ve thought relative to the other ones, Rutherford said about the Bay Area. Of the total number of California cases, 1,432 hospitalisations and 597 people are the ICU, a number that tripled from the weekend.Santa Clara, which has been hit the hardest in the Bay Area, reported 125 hospitalisations.\u0026nbspNew York City has more than 7,741 people hospitalised, 1,700 of which are in the ICU.Stay-at-home orders impact on states like California and New York will not be seen for another few weeks as less and less people are coming in contact with each other.It\u0027s going to take a couple of generations, 10 to 14 days, to see some peaking in the curve, Dr Rutherford said. And that is assuming the effect (of the virus) happens instantly.The epidemiologist added even though signs are cautiously showing the curve could be flattening, this was not the time for the Bay Area to lift regulations. Instead, it was announced the stay-at-home order across California\u0026nbspwould extend until 1 May.You have to be cautious about this stuff, he said. This is the time to save those 10 to 20,000 (lives).New York City has been clear that\u0026nbspadditional weeks are needed\u0026nbspto determine where the curve is going, and Mr Cuomo\u0026nbspsaid that apex could happen in seven to 21 days. New York state\u0027s stay-at-home order was extended through\u0026nbsp15 April with the anticipation for it to get pushed back again.Everyone who is infected by four weeks out is going to show up, Dr Gorshen added. They will be identified. (New York City) can then flatten the curve of our hospital surge.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quite right too.And boy, are they going to need it once they’re in the full glare of the LA-based paparazzi, who operate under far fewer legal restrictions than those based in the UK.One was caught trespassing at the school of a celebrity’s child, another scaled a wall at Jenner Aniston’s to try to get a shot of her, other stars have had their cars blocked by paps, singer Niall Horan was dragged to the floor by one at LAX airport and they’ve been known to sit outside doctor’s surgeries to snap someone famous coming out.So good luck with all that, Harry and Meghan.You’re about to realise how protected you were in the UK, both by the stricter laws and the ring of steel that shields the Royal Family.Little wonder that the rumoured bill for their personal security is estimated at around £million a year.Add in the cost of other staff, general living expenses and the £.million they said they would repay for the refurbishment of Frogmore “cottage” — now sitting empty — and it’s clear they are spending money like water with no discernible means of actually earning much to make up any shortfall.Which, once the Covid- crisis has passed, means they will be vulnerable to the attention of the super-rich.And we all know how that worked out for Prince Andrew.But perhaps the greatest concern for the Duke and Duchess of Sussexis that, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s attention is erted where and the news of their move to LA was greeted with a collective, “so what ”A mass disinterest which, when you’re “former royals for sale”, is very worrying indeed.FORMER Love Island star Maura Higgins has revealed she could get any boy she wanted at school.“I’ve always been very, very confident,” she says.Following her recent appearance on Dancing On Ice, reports that she’d split from boyfriend Curtis Pritchard were followed by rumours that she’d got a little too close to her married skating partner Alex Demetriou.But Maura claims they are “just friends”, adding: “Alex and I are so close – we’ve trained together for months . . . but that’s it.”I’m sure his we, fellow skater Carlotta Edwards, will now feel deeply reassured.Yes, it’s come to this. Even the Christmas-themed ones on Amazon were sold out.So instead, like millions of other homes across the country, I have been busying myself with all “those” household tasks we steadfastly ignore for the rest of the year.The patio is sparkling clean, all those cupboards where Lord Lucan could be hiding have been cleared out, my bike looks brand new and I actually baked a pie, which has rarely happened before.I have even vacuumed our mattresses.

Results can take between a few hours to a couple of days to come back.The second test is the much-awaited antibody test - hailed a game-changer.The test is a finger-prick test and is being designed to be performed at home, giving results almost instantly like a pregnancy test.It detects antibodies that the immune system produces to fight coronavirus so can tellyou have had the bug, and are immune.These tests would give the green light for NHS staff, key workers and the public to go back to work, and could help relax lockdown measures.Testing for coronavirus serves a number of important purposes.The swab test can tell us how many people currently have Covid-.Meanwhile, the antibody test can tell us how many people in the population have had it.It can also give an idea of the asymptomatic population - how many people have had coronavirus, but have shown no symptoms.Knowing whos had the bug and who hasnt will drastically speed up our route out of lockdown.It will allow us to identy who is safe to go back to work, and in some countries like Germany there are plans to give people certicates to identy they are safe to move about.Labour deputy leadership candidate and AE doctor, Rosena Allin-Khan, who has gone back to work on the NHS front line, said another important aspect is staff wellbeing.She wrote to Matt Hancock telling him the lack of testing is having a huge mental health impact on our NHS workforce.Meanwhile, ex-health secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed his concern over the lack of mass testing, branding it very worrying.He said it had been key to finally controlling the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic originated in December.Yesterday, Department of Health figures showed , people had been tested for coronavirus, in the previous  hours.That falls short of the Governments promise to test  , people a day.Last night, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said we have capacity to test , people.Meanwhile, the PM has expressed his desire to reach , tests a day.Today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told hospitals to test more of their workforce, lting the restriction that trusts could only use  per cent of their capacity to test staff. The remaining  per cent was reserved for testing patients.In the UK around , people are being tested every day.In total since the start of the outbreak , people have been tested, with , testing positive.Meanwhile, in Germany, , tests are carried out each day - thats more than half a million a week.In total, South Korea has tested around , people since the start of the outbreak.Both countries have far fewer deaths than the UK.Testing for viruses is not a simple process.It requires the right equipment, testing conditions and as the Governments top doctor keeps reminding us, one thing worse that no test, is a bad test.But critics have pointed out, this crisis has been building since the start of the year, accusing the authorities of acting too late.Tim Colbourn, associate professor of global health epidemiology at University College London, said: The UK was complacent and didnt think it could happen here.We didnt see the signs quickly.Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, said part of the blame rests with Public Health England.He told Radio s Today programme: We have  molecular virology labs in the UK.If they were doing  tests a day, we would be up to Germany levels of testing and that is perfectly feasible.Public Health England were slow and controlled and only allowed non-PHE labs to start testing two weeks ago, but that was after the strategy to sht to end community tests.Prof Costello is referring to the announcement on March  to stop testing people in the community, as the Government announced a move from containment to delay in their plan to tackle the outbreak.From that point, only people in hospital have been tested for Covid-.The Government has repeatedly said their goal is to increase testing capacity across the UK.Boris Johnson has said he wants to reach , a day, while Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said at yesterdays daily briefing we have capacity to carry out , tests.Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, said the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, are in talks with pharmaceutical companies across the world, after admitting a shortage of chemicals is partly to blame.The chemicals are needed for the antigen tests - or nasal swab tests currently being used to test NHS staff and patients.Mr Gove said last night that the Government must go further, faster to increase testing.We are increasing the number of tests, he said.One of the constraints on our capacity to increase testing overall is supply of the specic reagents, the specic chemicals, that are needed in order to make sure that tests are reliable.When asked when the Government started placing orders for key test parts, the PMs spokesman said today: Weve been working with industry throughout.But as the Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Medical Officer have both set out, there is a global demand for reagents.Its clear from industry that they are working as hard as they can in order to support the NHS, and we are working alongside them.The chemical reagents the Government admits the UK is short of are needed for the nasal swab tests - the antigen test.Dr Colin Butter, at the University of Lincoln, explained there are two main bits to the chemistry.Many companies make suitable kits for this, he said. Universities and others will have lots on the shelves.The next step involves ingredients and chemicals to run the test itself.Prof Lawrence Young from the University of Warwick explained:  The test is complicated, and requires many dferent synthetic components which probably accounts for the shortages given the unprecedented demand.In recent days, theres been a lot of talk about the two dferent types of tests that the government are ramping up.The government refers to them as the have you got it antigen test or the have you had it antibody test.Here we explain the dference between the two...What is an antigen test Antigens are found on the surface of invading pathogens, including coronavirus.Testing for antigens can determine whether someone is currently carrying the virus and are actively infectious.The NHS is currently using antigen tests in hospitals to determinesomeone is currently infected with Covid-.Samples are taken using a swab - which resemble a large cotton bud - from deep inside the nose and throat before being sent off to a lab for testing.Most labs use a method called the polymerase chain reaction , which takes several hours to get a result.It can take days for labs to run the tests and tell people their result.Several companies are working on ways to fast track this type of testing.What is an antibody test When a person gets infected with antigen, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies in response - as a way to fight the infection.After they recover, those antibodies float in the blood for months, maybe even years.Thats the bodys way of defending itself in case it becomes infected with the virus again.So an antibody test specically looks for antibodies which will be able to tell whether youve already been exposed to Covid-.Anyone who has already had the illness is presumed to be immune to getting it again - at least, in the intermediate term.This would allow them to go back to work safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely to become infected again or pass the virus on.The check that has been developed for Covid- is a finger-prick blood test, with the samples sent to laboratories and results available within a few days.Dr Hilary Jones, a GP and resident doctor on Good Morning Britain, explained that it works almost like a pregnancy test, except you need a drop of blood.These tests are being developed by several dferent firms and Public Health Englandis also working on its own test.They still need to be validated to ensure they give accurate results.Dr Al Edwards at the University of Readings School of Pharmacy added that there are a lot of ingredients that go into a swab test.Any of these might be hard to get hold of in the current rush, he said. The world is seeing more of these virus tests conducted than ever before.But they could also be simply the swabs or containers for collecting samples.“The real catch is – we are very good at making a highly accurate test fast.But to make that test accurate, you need to keep the ingredients fixed. So we are likely seeing a shortage of the exact ingredients used in the approved tests.Although other versions might work it’s not easy to simply switch to a dferent type.There can be tiny changes that make the test fail – for example,you use the wrong swab to take the sample, the virus might not be detected.Professor Stephen Baker, an expert in molecular microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said: There is a massive demand for raw materials, this is not unique to the UK and many places no longer have stock of essential reagents.The Chemical Industries Association told The Times that demand for key chemicals is increasing.But it said reagents are being made and they are being delivered to the NHS.It said: Every business here in the UK and globally is looking at what they can do to help meet the demand as a matter of urgency.To clary the exact NHS  need and meet it, all relevant UK industries are continuing to work closely with the Government.The first hint of the coronavirus pandemic emerged at the end of December in China.While few countries could have predicted its rapid spread, some, including South Korea were better prepared.The nation had vast stocks of face masks and testing kids on standby, making them better placed to cope.Having endured the  Sars epidemic and the more recent Mers outbreak, South Korea built up huge stockpiles and had signicant testing capacity ready and waiting.Germany, which is testing , patients a week and has plans to test , a day, was quick to learn from the response of countries in Asia and began ramping up testing at an early stage.Professor Lawrence Young, from Warwick University, said countries like Germany also benefit from a more joined up approach.A better relationship with the biotech industry, more German virologists producing tests in January and central coordination by the Robert Koch Institute all gave Germany a head start, he said.When asked why this was such a challenge for the UK, he added: It just requires better national coordination.It highlights a lack of investment in virology over many years.Professor Stephen Baker, of Cambridge Uni, said there is no overnight solution.He warned: There are multiple steps to ensure that the methods used and results that are a correctly validated, as there is nothing more dangerous at the moment than reporting incorrect negative or positive results to staff or patients.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bottoms up!WE have never really been as clever at shouting about our national drink as the French have about plonk.But brewing is actually a much more sophisticated process than winemaking, which leads to beer containing more flavour components than wine does.It also has the added advantage that you could live off it – at a push.It’s got just about everything you need – although you might want to throw in the odd bag of crisps for energy and pork scratchings for fat and, er, vitamins.The key with making beer at home is sanitising all your equipment, but basically you’re looking at the following procedure.CIDER is the easiest drink to make of all and my absolute favourite.There are countless dferent recipes but all you really need is apples.You can’t go wrong because the juice ferments all on its own through naturally occurring yeasts on the apple skins and in the air.Orchards are enchanting places.The apple trees on my farm are just coming in to blossom, traditionally the signal that the cider from last year’s apple crop is ready.Butyou can get your hands on apples, you can start whenever you like – and as long as everything is scrupulously clean it is drinkable at all stages of the fermentation process.I really like it at about two weeks, when it’s just starting to go fizzy but before the alcohol has had time to develop. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It doesnt mean anything.The notice we were given is worthless. What theyre trying to do is limit us so to not sell plants, and Im saying its wrong.Thats why Im tearing up this notice, because its rubbish. The issue is that the council agreed that were a hardware store and can sell hardware equipment, theyre trying to limit us to that.The frustrated businessman said the closure would see £million of plants and stock will be dumped in landfill - while supermarkets continue to sell the same items.He told Devon Live: We are desperately trying to avoid the business going bankrupt and having to lay off  employees.It seems to be one rule for supermarkets and other large national chain stores and one rule for Plants Galore - no consistency or fairness being applied.I want the council to explain why a number of retailers are not being given prohibition notices like us as they are selling plants. At our Exeter store we are just  metres from Aldi supermarket where  trolleys of garden plants are selling in their car park.It cannot be fair that we are prohibited from selling these products while the local authority continue to allow other retailers to sell identical products on our doorstep.We cannot understand why we are alone in receiving a prohibition notice while the council simply ignores other retailers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dr Hilary Jones – Health Editor for ITV’s Good Morning Britain – has been answering your questions which have been pouring in to The Sun in their thousands.Today, EMMA PIETRAS brings you the much-respected doctor’s answers to our readers’ dilemmas – on how to help care for their loved ones at the same time as safeguarding their own health.Q. Is it safe to travel from Surrey into London to take care of my grandchildren while my daughter gives birth in hospital A. Somebody has to look after the grandchildren butyou are over  or have a pre-existing medical condition, your daughter should really try to find someone she is only expected to stay in hospital for a few hours for the birth.Butthere really is no one , you can consider this an essential journey, as your grandchildren need care.Q. I am asthmatic and my partner is type- diabetic. Which of us is at greater risk  We have to do the shopping ourselves, as there are never delivery slots available with any supermarkets.A. Your conditions put both of you in the vulnerable group with an equal risk of greater consequences should you come down with the virus.While you need to stay at home as much as possible and to physically distance yourself from other people, it is all right for either of you to get essential supplies from the supermarket — as infrequently as possible.Q. Can you catch the virus from takeaway food A. Cooking food would kill the virus easily.So it all depends on how the food is put into any packaging and how effectively personal hygiene is being practised by the restaurant staff.If the take-away is in packaging, remove the food, discard the packaging and wash your hands before eating.Q. I’m in my eighties and can’t do the jobs I used to do around the home. Am I safe to call a tradesman to do the work A. For non-emergency work, please wait before you allow any tradesmen into your home.Any one of them could unwittingly bring the virus into your home, with potentially disastrous consequences.However,you have a flood from a leaking pipe or you smell gas from the boiler, that is dferent and would take priority — although you must still physically distance yourself from whoever helps you.Q. My house is joined on to a funeral director’s and I’ve noticed the staff wearing face masks. Should I be worriedthey are dealing with coronavirus victims A. If they are not already dealing with coronavirus victims, they may well be soon.Funeral directors are doing a wonderful job despite a shortage of proper personal protective equipment, and are dealing with bereaved people whose arrangements for their loved ones’ funerals have been severely disrupted.However, the virus cannot affect you living next door — although you should, of course, physically distance yourself from the staff when talking to them.Q. My husband, who is , has an appointment next week at the hospital to have an injection for macular degeneration. Is this safe A. Check with the hospital whether this appointment is going ahead.The treatment is designed to help save people’s sight but many such procedures are being postponed during the current emergency.The clinic may well say that it is up to your husband, in which case, you will need to make a decision based on how severe his eye condition is and how quickly it is progressing.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It just cares about creating doubt and anxiety.Times of crisis are times of anxiety and it is easier to explain the appearance of an aberration like SARS-CoV- as the result of an act of deliberation or incompetence of a laboratory than it is to admit to the fact that nature and evolution. Coronavirus has now infected at least close to a million people worldwide and killed , since the outbreak began in December.But Covid- conspiracy theories are spreading just as fast Some online crackpots have claimed the virus is the work of the US military, while other wacky webizens allege the outbreak is a hoax designed to stop Brexit.Others allege the disease is a plot by US spies to tank Chinas economy.Chinas state-run Global Times has reported that Chinese internet users and experts are calling for more information on whether The Fort Detrick laboratory was linked to the disease.It cited coincidental events between the outbreak and the closure of the CIA lab.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I dont think it was even that hard to persuade him.Harry was wrapped around her finger even when she was just a USA actress. She then was able to extend her circle thanks to their relationship and bring names like Oprah and Serena Williams to their wedding.He was smitten and star struck over the whole thing. I don’t think she had to twist his arm to move to Hollywood.The shock move to LA has been dubbed Megxit  and has “stunned and horried” members of the Royal Family.They believed that Harry, , and Meghan, , would consider ing to Britain to help the royal family on the national effort to battle to coronavirus outbreak.The growing health crisis, has seen Prince Charles, , test positive for Covid- and The Queen, , and ailing Prince Philip, , put into self-isolation.News of the bombshell move came last week as US entertainment giant Disney pushed ahead with the release of a charity film about elephants, for which Meghan provides the voiceover.The deal is believed to have been done after Harry cornered the company’s boss Bob Iger at the premiere of The Lion King in London last year.But the friend, who became estranged from Meghan several years ago, said she was not surprised the couple speeded up their move to LA instead of ing to the UK to join the royal family.“They were never a consideration for her, it’s been obvious from the start,” the LA-based former pal said.“Her relationship to that family was dependent on her freedom to have a ‘role’ that she felt was big enough for her.“She wanted it her way, and she wanted it quickly – she was never going to change the timeline for them.“These stories of security issues, border closure or taxes in Canada are a convenient cover to have them putting their plan into action.“The timing has also worked out pretty well with the release of her first project,” she added, referring to the Disney+ documentary Elephant.According to the confidante, Meghan will be “very pleased with herself” after persuading Prince Harry to move their lives to her hometown at such breakneck pace.“Anyone who knows her knew this is where it was headed as soon as she saw she couldn’t have her own way in the UK,” the source said“Everything is negotiable for her and the moment it’s not in her favor, she is just going to cut her losses.“Now she is back home, near her mom, her friends and her PR team. She doesnt have to ask for permission from the royal family in how she chooses to live her le and she can acquire income in all sorts of fields.“She is very pleased with herself, I’m sure. In just a couple of years she has made it back as a big fish to the place where she previously had barely made an impact as a working actress.“Shell be happy to be back in the Soho House atmosphere, taking meetings and reunited with her avocado toasts and runs on the beach.“But I imagine she will keep her circles ever more exclusive, hosting dinners at her house where she can have a controlled environment and enjoying that people will be wanting access to her le.“In LA she can flaunt her trophy and her royal fame without any constraints of tradition. Her celebrity meter is quite high now and there is no better place for it than Hollywood, where narcissism is encouraged.“She can make sure that the relationships she keeps are worthwhile for her.”But she thinks the circumstances might work in Harry’s favor and, despite what some people think, he may well enjoy the new lestyle.“I think Harry will like the change of scenery and the kind of attention they will be getting,” said the source.“It will also be easier on him than it was on her first husband. When she was with Trevor , her hunger for fame was an issue.“She wanted every opportunity for a red carpet, a magazine shoot, a photograph at an event. He had to deal with sharing her with that side of the job.“But now that they are so high profile, at least for now, she won’t be needing to do all that. Harry wont have to deal with that.“And with Archie being so young still, they will probably keep a tight family unit and try to be lowkey. There’s no sex appeal to sell, the play is now about the role of the mommy that can do it all, perhaps even be the bread winner.She added: “Her mom will also bring some normality to their le, I would expect.”The Sussexes left the £.million mansion they were borrowing in Vancouver and took a flight out of the city shortly before US President Donald Trump and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau closed the border between their countries.They are due to step down as senior royals on Wednesday.They are also set to announce their new brand and charity on Instagram, The Sun revealed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In our country alone, there are more than , kinds of protected wild animal species.“If the local authority is to produce a list of the wild animals that cannot be eaten, it will be too y and cannot answer the question exactly what animals can be eaten.”Yulin’s dog meat festival is infamous worldwide, with locals believing the combination of the meat and lychees brings health in the coming months.Pictures often show piles of dog carcasses piled up for preparation, and a video of a dog being blowtorched alive sparked outrage in .Dog is not part of the mainstream Chinese diet, but the state remains the largest market for it the world - with , tonnes produced each year.Chinese food safety laws are often broken as stolen dogs are smuggled without any proper paperwork.The ban on dog and cat meat in Shenzhen comes after the nationwide ban on the consumption of wild animals - which are often purchased at wet markets.They are named after the melting of ice used to preserve goods and the washing of floors to clean blood and entrails.It emerged early in the global coronavirus pandemic that a market in Wuhan selling wildle for meat may have been the source of the outbreak.Unknown viruses held in animals are given free reign to mutate and infect humans in these conditions, often crossing between multiple species before jumping to man.Chinese government officials have been attempting to crackdown on the trade as more than , people were killed by the virus in the state.Calls continue for the markets themselves to be closed down to stop such a pandemic developing again.US senator Lindsey Graham said yesterday the trade must be completely shut down - announcing he is writing a letter on the matter to the World Health Organisation and Chinese ambassador.He said: “What can China do to help the world  Shut those markets down.”Mr Graham slammed the markets as “gross” and “disgusting” - saying they “transmit viruses from animals to human beings”.Scientists continue to probe exactly what caused the coronavirus, with early suggestions claiming the virus may have originated in bats.The bats would have then transmitted the bug to another unknown animal, before it then passed to humans.China cracked down on the sale of exotic species after the  SARS outbreak — which killed nearly  people — was linked to markets selling live animals.The ban was later lted and the animals reappeared.And so far coronavirus has infected almost , people worldwide, and killed nearly ,.Unfounded conspiracies continue to rage about the origins of the coronavirus as video emerged of a Chinese virus expert catching bats. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: EPA Security checks visitors on the at a shop in Shenzhen during the coronavirus pandemicOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The key challenge now is to encourage more people to claim UC, process those claims rapidly, and get payments out to people as soon as possible. “The roll-out of Universal Credit in recent years has been beset by controversy. But its performance over the next few months is the real test of this new benefit system – as it provides a living standards leline to millions of households.” Despite teething problems the think tank acknowledged UC has been more resilient than many people thought. It comes after new figures showed , people filed claims for Universal Credit in the last  days - around nine times the usual rate.

The project holds music sessions for parents of children in their early years, extra-curricular music workshops for young people, and a choir for local people. Although unable to meet as many of their members are within the vulnerable criteria, the group were determined that those who viewed the choir as a leline, wouldn’t go without.

It was the most severe pandemic in modern world history, and was caused by an HN virus with genes of avian origin. The high mortality in young healthy people aged between around - year was a unique feature of the Spanish Flu pandemic. While there is not one simple explanation for the phenomenon, experts believe could be partly explained by the flu triggering a deadly immune response, a ‘cytokine storm’ – the rapid release of immune cells and inflammatory molecules. It has also been linked to an uneven control techniques applied by dferent countries during the pandemic, when many young people were scattered around the world and populations were already suffering from the aftermath of war.

The airline has grounded much of its -strong fleet during the crisis, with the expected deal to affect all staff at Gatwick and London City Airport. The formeraposs North Terminal was closed on Wednesday while the South Terminal is now only operating from pm and pm.

Call centre staff and non-live operatives are not being suspended and will continue to receive full pay following the union talks - it is understood.A source told The Sun : Negotiations have been tough but there is an acknowledgement at BA and the union that these are unprecedented times. The decision to suspend a large proportion of its workforce, despite BA parent company International Airlines Group in a much better financial position than many competitors, shows the extent the industry has been hit by travel bans.

She never dreamed it would be anything sinister, Wales Online reports.But in August , when she was still breastfeeding her then three-month-old daughter Isobel, she was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. The former retail team leader, who is married to youth worker Gavin, , tried to fight the disease with aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy – but tragically, it has now spread to her lungs, bones and brain. In early March, she was given three to four months to live, and began to put together a bucket list – but her plans were dashed when she discovered that she is considered to be extremely vulnerable, and so must self-isolate for  weeks under public health guidance regarding the Covid- pandemic. Last week, she penned a powerful blog post about her situation, saying: “Imagine seeing messages online telling you because youaposre in the vulnerable category youaposre expected to stay in isolation for  weeks - which in my terms is equal to the rest of my le. “Imagine having to tell an extremely large percentage of your family, as well as your lelong friends - most of which are front line workers - that you will never see them again, and those that arenapost putting their own health at risk have a list of extremely strict rules to followthey wish to see you before you pass.  “Imagine using this time to plan your own funeral knowing that nobody will be able to attend. “Imagine craving as much normalcy for your children at this moment because absolutely everything in their innocent, carefree lives is about to have a sht on seismic levels.” Previously fit and healthy, Rhiann lived an idyllic le with her husband and two young children. Then, she was playing with Max one day when he jumped up at her, accidentally bashing her in the chest. A nasty bruise was left behind on her left breast – and, examining it one day, she discovered a cm lump. Tests followed, including an ultrasound, and on  August, , doctors broke the news that she had breast cancer.  “At the time, I was still breastfeeding Isobel. It sounds silly now, but one of the hardest parts of the diagnosis was knowing I’d have to stop,” she said. “I felt I’d learned so much with Max. I knew what I was doing with Isobel, and it was a way of bonding.” Shortly after her diagnosis, Rhiann had a biopsy to confirm exactly what form of breast cancer she had. The results showed it was triple negative which, according to Cancer Research, is when the cancerous cells do not have receptors for the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, or the protein Her. Making up around  in every  breast cancer cases in the UK, symptoms include a change in the size, shape or feel of the breast, dimpling of the skin, a change in the nipple such as it becoming inverted or irregular in shape, blood-stained discharge from the nipple, a rash or swelling in the armpit. “I thought it was best not to look up much online, as it wouldn’t be good for my mental health,” said Rhiann. “It’s such a shame that research into triple negative doesn’t seem to be as far along as other breast cancers. That desperately needs to change so other families don’t go through what we are.” Next, Rhiann, who has been tested and does not have the BRCA gene mutation that can sometimes increase the risk of breast cancer, had a CT scan, which revealed more shocking news. “There was a total of three lumps in my breast – the one I’d felt, plus two more,” she explained. “The scan also showed up some specks in my lung. They were too small to be biopsied at that stage, so doctors said they’d monitor them with progress scans.” From there, Rhiann began chemotherapy, which left her nauseous and drained. “I tried to be strong, but you do get those moments where you ask, ‘Why me ’” she candidly recalled. The nausea was overwhelming. The only thing I could do was try and sleep it away.  “In the end, I went to my GP and was put on antidepressants. I knew I could get therapy too, but there was a long wait time, and I needed something that could help me right away. “I still felt physically sick, but with them, at least I wasn’t crying all the time.” Within two weeks, Rhiann’s long dark hair began to fall out, so, to claw back a shred of control, she decided to shave it off in September , with Gavin doing the same in solidarity. Little Isobel did not notice the change, and Max soon got used to her new bald appearance. “When I decided to shave it off, I’d already bought a wig, but I took it off one day and Max said, ‘No, Mummy,’” she said. “He just needed a moment to get used to me, as within a few minutes, he was absolutely fine, toddling over wanting a cuddle.” Halfway through chemotherapy, in late October, Rhiann had a progress scan which showed that the lumps in her breast had halved in size, and some of the spots in her lung had disappeared altogether.  “It seemed like my body was really responding to the chemo. Everyone was confident I’d be able to survive for many years to come,” she said. But then, another scan after her final session on December  revealed that, tragically, the disease had spread to her breastbone. For the first time, Rhiann’s le had a time limit as doctors gave her a prognosis of  years. “That was horric to hear,” she admitted. “I started to think about all the things I was going to miss, all the milestones, Christmases and birthdays.” To give Rhiann the best chance possible, doctors decided to perform a mastectomy before putting her on a course of radiotherapy. But, her immune system virtually non-existent, she kept getting chest infections, leaving medics fearing she was not strong enough for surgery, and worrying the healing time could delay the rest of her treatment. Then, when she felt one of her existing breast lumps growing, she had a scan in February, which found that cancer was active again in her bones and lungs.  “They told me that meant my prognosis was now just one year,” she said. “Just like that, I’d lost nine years. “My mastectomy was supposed to take place the following week, but it was decided that I may not be strong enough, and that the healing time would delay everything , so I pushed straight on with radiotherapy.” So, Rhiann began having weekly sessions, which meant spending a couple of hours in hospital each time. Thankfully she was able to stay at home the rest of the time to be with her children.Then, in early March, she started having daily headaches.It was like a pressure headache, but just in one area, which was really unusual, she explained. Worried, she mentioned them to her oncologist, who arranged an MRI scan – which found the disease had spread to her brain, too. “The scan of my brain looked the same as the one of my lung – covered in little spots,” she said. “I do worry what the cancer being in my brain will mean for things like my capacity and memory. “This disease has already taken so much from me – am I going to turn into a completely dferent person too ” Worst of all, Rhiann’s scan results meant her prognosis decreased once again, and now, she has between three and four months left. She continued: “I was destroyed by that. I can’t get my head around the fact that my children will grow up without me. “Isobel is so little that she won’t even remember me, and Max may ask for me at first, but he’s still so small too, so one day, he’ll stop.” To create as many special memories as possible with whatever time she has left, Rhiann soon set about creating a bucket list, which included things like one last visit to Weymouth, Dorset – a place that holds many treasured childhood memories of holidays with her family – and a trip to see the Northern Lights in Iceland.  However, as she is still undergoing cancer treatment that has compromised her immunity, she is considered a vulnerable person, and so has been advised to self-isolate for  weeks to protect herself from the coronavirus spread. “That basically means spending the rest of my le in isolation,” she said. “I wasn’t exactly going out much anyway as my immune system is so compromised, but now, people can’t even visit me, and things like trips abroad or family days out are unlikely to happen.” Now, Rhiann is busy working out how she can tick off her bucket list at home. Instead of taking Max to the aquarium, she plans to bring it to him by buying him a pet fish and tank to keep it in. She will also be holding Christmas and Easter over the same weekend, where the family will have a turkey dinner with all the trimmings, as well as an egg hunt in the garden.She has been buoyed by the incredible kindness of a group of pals, who she has never met in real le, but bonded with over Instagram.The network of ladies from around the UK have set up a GoFundMe page to help her to make as many special memories as possible, as well as ease the financial burden for her family after she passes away.

The mum-of-two will not be able to able to see her family until they come together to lay Ian to rest on April .The family will also not be allowed to travel together to Ianaposs funeral or be in close contact during the service, Daily Record reports.Ian, from Coatbridge, Scotland, suffered with a heart condition and diabetes, and after falling unwell with suspected coronavirus he was admitted to University Hospital Monklands on March . Hours later Sandra received a call from a aposcryingapos doctor to say that her husband of  years would not survive Covid-. He died two days later. Sandraaposs distraught daughter Lesley Allan said: My mum was not allowed to go hospital with Ian. Very soon after he was admitted, she received a call saying that he was critical and would not survive. The doctor was very upset as this is not how he would deliver this sort of news normally. He promised to look after Ian like he was his dad. After being kept apart from her husband, heartbroken Sandra was allowed in to see him for a short period as long as she wore protective equipment. Lesley added: Ian was in a single room and my mum had to wear a mask as she entered the hospital.  As she had been living with him, she didnapost need to wear the mask while in the room but had to wear it when she left and keep it on till she got to her car. Thankfully mum was allowed to be with him when he passed away but we didnapost get a chance to say goodbye. The family have been struggling to come to terms with the loss of Ian and the children have been unable to even give their mum a hug. Lesley continued: My mum continues to be in  day self isolation so me and my sister Jenner have been unable to see her. No one has been able to just give her a hug. Itaposs been horrendous. Our natural reaction would be to be with her, supporting her and helping to arrange the funeral. The hardest part is knowing sheaposs on own going through this. Weaposve been staying in touch through calls and FaceTime, but itaposs not the same. Former Airdrie Academy janitor Ian has been described by his loved ones as a true gentleman. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Lesley added: His smile would light up a room. My mum always talks of how every morning he would greet her with the biggest smile Even in recent years when his health wasnapost as good, he always had a smile for you. I just hang on to the last time I saw him, we had such a good laugh. There was always laughter with Ian. Ian has a daughter named Julie, as well as being step-dad to Lesley and Jenner for the last  years. Only immediate family will be allowed to attend his funeral at at Daldowie Crematorium next week. Lesley added: There will be no service at the funeral parlour and while the service at the crematorium will be personal, it will be minimalist, almost alien like as there will be so few people there.  We have to go to the crematorium in our own cars as we cannot be in a funeral car together nor can we sit next to each other in the crematorium due to social distancing guidelines. While it is hard, as a family we donapost want anyone to be put at risk and suffer what we are going through which is why as painful as it is, we will continue to follow the guidelines.

Some of them are younger than I am and they are certainly not the frail, elderly people that maybe some of us have been led to believe we would be seeing.  They are young, they are fit and they have young families. Dr Hepburn urged the British public to follow the isolation advice.

After this, the sample is taken it is sent off to a laboratory for testing.  It comes as the Government announced that Brits will soon be able to conduct coronavirus antibody tests at home.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailEight hours after her birth in , Kamiyah Mobley was taken from her mother’s arms by a woman posing as a nurse in a sickening kidnap which sparked one of America’s longest-running missing person’s cases. Kamiyah grew up not knowing that her “mother” was her kidnapper – until three years ago, when she was , a series of tip-offs led police to her home and DNA tests proved her true identity. Now reunited with her real family, she sits with her father Craig Aiken as he sends a message to Madeleine McCann’s parents, telling Kate and Gerry to look to his story and “never give up hope” that their daughter will be found alive. Craig, , says: “We are bound together by the terrible crimes that befell our daughters. Very few parents in the world are united by such an atrocious wrong. But I have worn the shoes the Kate and Gerry now wear. I have walked the footsteps they now tread and I have come out the other side.” He says he would welcome the chance to speak to the McCanns, whose three-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May , . He says: “I know only too well their very real pain ain’t going to stop until their child comes home and that’s when the healing is going to begin. “All I ever used to say is that Kamiyah is coming home. Never once did I give up on my hopes and prayers. I never felt once Kamiyah was dead. I never gave up hope. I would teach Kate and Gerry hope. “They have to stick together because sometimes you blame it on each other as we did. It can tear you apart. It takes away the concern for the child.” Kamiyah Mobley was snatched from a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, in July  by Gloria Williams, who had entered new mum Shanara Mobley’s room posing as a nurse telling her the baby had a fever and had to be checked. Williams left the ward with the baby and raised Kamiyah as her own, giving her the  name, Alexis Manigo, and a forged birth certicate. Three years ago, after a series of tip-offs, police found Kamiyah in Walterboro, South Carolina,  miles from where she was born, living with her abductor. Williams is serving  years for the kidnap, while -year-old Kamiyah tries to come to terms with her true origins.  Her relationship with her birth mother is strained, but Kamiyah and her father Craig have a strong bond. At the time of her birth, music producer Craig was in jail on a minor drugs charge. He explains how a female officer broke the news of her kidnap. Craig says: “She said, ‘I have good news and bad news’. I said, ‘What’s the good news, because I am already in jail. What could be worse than this ’.She said, ‘Your daughter was born seven pounds eight ounces. Her name is Kamiyah’. I began to get excited, and then I saw no one  around me was. “I asked her what the bad news was, and she said, ‘Your daughter was kidnapped’. I was like ‘kidnapped ’. “I was confused. I was hurt. I was lost. I couldn’t understand or process what it all meant. To me, kidnapping was only on TV or in the movies.” Craig and Shanara were then treated as suspects, much as Gerry and Kate were by the Portuguese police, who named them “arguidos”. Craig says: “The police and FBI kept asking meI had any enemies or do I owe anybody money.  “But it was only after my release from jail, I realised I was becoming a suspect when they spent more time on me than the actual kidnapping.” Craig says: “I know like the McCanns what it’s like to be a parent that was accused or had suspicion upon them. It felt like the world turned against me at a time when you needed it most. “All you wanted was to find your daughter. You just want the nightmare to end.But because of what the police didn’t put out, the lack of information made us suspects.“One of the main reasons Kamiyah was kidnapped for so long was because the police wasted so much time on us. “If they would have used as much focus and harassment that they used on me to find her, she would have been found.The same goes for Madeleine. It felt like I was under suspicion for  years almost. “Eighteen years went by, and people still suspected her mother and me of kidnap.It was only when Kamiyah was found that the suspicion on us ever stopped.”  Asked whether he believes any harm could have come to Madeleine, Craig says: “I hope it ain’t too late for their daughter. “I’m not saying that she has come to any harm. “I never once thought that about my daughter and they shouldn’t about theirs. “I would tell them to keep hoping becauseit happened to me, then it can happen to them.” Kamiyah then gives her own message to the McCanns.She says: “I am the proof that eventually we find our way back home.Never give up that Maddie will one day do the same too. Take heart, and we are always here for you.” Since being found Kamiyah’s relationship with her birth mother, who split from Craig soon after the kidnapping, has had its up and downs.  At one point, Shanara revealed she was not even on speaking terms with Kamiyah because of her daughter’s continued attachment to Williams. Shanara said: “I shouldn’t have to compete with a kidnapper – she has to pick one of us.” She said the pain of being rejected by Kamiyah had cut just as deep as the day Williams kidnapped her.  She said: “It’s like a tug of war between us. Whenever I feel I’m winning her back, boom, the other side pulls me down.” Earlier this year, Kamiyah said she would still like to see her “mother” Gloria Williams, saying: “I just want to let her know I’m okay.” But Kamiyah’s relationship with her father has become incredibly strong.

Terrying scenes of animal cruelty are being recorded throughout the Asian country as it s to normality following the lockdown. The Wuhan wet market, has been widely blamed as the source of the virus, which has killed thousands of people across the world, and will continue to take the lives of many more. A pangolin infected by bats is widely believed to be the source of the outbreak. Previous killer diseases SARS and bird flu were traced to similar sites and China has now banned the sale and consumption of wildle to “safeguard public health and ecological security”, under orders from President Xi Jinping. Yet multiple species are still being crammed together, slaughtered and sold in filthy conditions, contaminated with blood and faeces, at countless markets in other Asian countries.  Experts believe Asia’s wildle markets, where live animals are flogged as exotic pets or butchered for food, are a “ticking time bomb” for new deadly pandemics. China had banned their wet markets, but that ban has now been lted, with experts worried this could create huge problems going forward. Speaking before the Chinese markets reopened Steve Galster founder of Freeland, a Bangkok-based anti-trafficking group warned: “Wuhan is a major wake-up call – mother nature’s revenge. The way to prevent further outbreaks is to stop the trade. China has put in place a ban, but this needs to be permanent as it is the biggest importer of wildle in the world. “Most wildle is trafficked by gangsters. This is not a regulated trade, so no wonder there are infections and viruses spreading.  “HIV, SARS and bird flu all came from animals and now this one too. These markets are ticking time bombs. In the markets stall holders are notorious for the cruelty they inflict on monkeys, cats and dogs, which are slaughtered in front of buyers. They sell bats, commonly made into a curried stew, as a traditional “cure” for respiratory diseases. Skewered rats grilled on barbecues are also available to buy, alongside snakes and lizards.

However, former Hearts and Falkirk man McGhee hopes it’s with Dundee having success.“We want to pick up where we left off because before the shutdown we started to hit a bit of form,” the -year-old said.“We knew that what would happen it was just about getting the right balance in the team.“I think we’ve got that now so we’re just raring to go again and finish the season as strongly as possible.”McGhee insists the squad are working together remotely to stay motivated and fit for a potentialto action.“I think some people will struggle but you don’t have an option right now other than to motivate yourself,” he added.“The way the world is at the moment you’ve either got the option to sit and watch TV, lying about doing nothing or you go out and exercise yourself.“Everyone in our changing-room will be going out to stay fit. I know the boys well enough to know everyone in the team is motivated to be successful.“Running and making sure they’re ready to go when football resumes is a big part of that.“We’ve got a few WhatsApp groups – one with the coaches and one with the players.“The coaching staff keep on top of us with our fitness stuff but everything is up in the air at the moment.“No one knows what’s happening so really it’s just a guessing game at the moment for us.“The manager’s been good, though, in keeping us going. We’ve been given tasks like a weekly challenge on a Friday.“Last week it was to do a k under  minutes on top of our programmes which have been tailored and specically set out.“With regards to the manager I think he trusts us all to go away and do it ourselves butwe don’t we know we’ll be found out when we go back.“It’s dficult because, normally, you’re building up towards a weekend where you’ve got a game coming up.“We’ve not got that now so it’s dficult to stay prepared for what may or may not happen physically and mentally.“The fact you’re not with the boys as well makes training dficult. The mental aspect is hard for everyone at the minute, in all walks of le.“We just need to get on with it and see what the outcome is then take it from there.”On top of everything , McGhee is working his way back from surgery on an ongoing wrist problem he’d carried for most of the season.His progress, however, has been good as he attempts to step up his rehab in the coming weeks.“I was in Dundee two weeks ago to get my cast off but ever since then I’ve been at home in East Kilbride,# he said.“I’ve just been staying in the house apart from my training programme. I’ve been out running and I managed to get myself a set of weights – that’s all I can really do right now.“Having broken a bone in my wrist it’s been dficult. Obviously, because I can’t get in to seeGerryto do movements on it.“He’s sending me stuff out, though, now I’ve had my cast off for a bit.“I’ll crack on with that and, hopefully, by the time football comes round again it should be strengthened and ready to go.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/Screwfix-scaled-e1585481666460-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"lee wilkie neil doncaster ian maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":null,"title":"managing the coronavirus shut down has been my toughest test as dundee boss says james mcpake","story":"The first year as a manager brings all sorts of challenges but James McPake admits dealing with the coronavirus from a football point of view takes the biscuit.The Dundee boss has had plenty to deal with during his debut campaign, including heavy derby defeats, issues with the law and a restless home support.Pressure has always been a major part of the role and it was ramped up during poor spells in the first half of the Championship campaign.McPake has always had more experienced heads to turn to for advice throughout his time in charge, whether assistant manager Jimmy Nicholl, technical director Gordon Strachan or someone outside the club.The current complete shutdown of Scottish football, however, is completely unprecedented.“This is one I can’t go to anyone for advice,” admits Dens gaffer McPake.“Nobody has faced anything like this.

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a

I used ingredients that I could afford.#Since beginning his MasterChef journey, Euan has struggled to watch himself throughout the competition.#It’s got a little bit easier but the first time you hear your voice coming out the TV you just cringe so hard, that it can’t get worse.#The guys who edit it, they make sure you don’t look like a complete idiot no matter what you do.“Once you get through a couple of rounds you start to feel a little less like you’re the impostor in the room. Which comes quite naturally to me, I was worried that I was the guy that they brought in to be bad.“Having had the chance to taste a few peoples food, I’d say that they’re all pretty fantastic. It’s pretty hard to pick a favourite out of the people I cooked against.“I feel like this competition would be a lot easierthe people weren’t so nice.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus claims 16 more lives in scotland","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe number of people in Scotland who have died from COVID- has risen to , the First Minister has announced.The coronavirus death toll rose by  on yesterday with confirmed cases now up to , from , yesterday.A total of  people are in intensive care as the virus accelerates, she said, although numbers are regarded as underestimate.In addition, she confirmed today that the popular Edinburgh Fringe Festival would not take place this summer, bringing to an end rumours it may happen on a much smaller scale.Addressing questions about the availability of ventilators in Scotland, Mrs Sturgeon said the Scottish Government #had a number# on order with overseas manufacturers.#Those orders will be delivered,they stay on track, over the period of the next number of weeks and by the summer,# she said.#It will take us to roundabout more than a thousand ventilators.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it.

The Scottish Government said it will focus on delivering this \"as soon as practicably possible\".It said the aim is to start taking applications by the end of  with payments being made from , subject to sufficient staff being in place.The delivery of existing benefits will continue.Ms Somerville said: \"Our approach to disability assistance was grounded in the professional judgement of health and social care practitioners and they are rightly needed where at this time.\"We also need to factor in that there will likely be further impact on Scottish Government and partner organisations staffing levels due to illness or caring responsibilities.ldquoAs such, I have had to take the dficult decision to halt the introduction of disability benefits that were due within the coming year.\"These will continue to be delivered by the UK Government. This is the only way to ensure people continue to get the financial support they need. It provides certainty and security of payment at a time of great anxiety.ldquoWhile I cannot make guarantees around a revised timeline for the introduction of these benefits, I can guarantee that the work will not stop. And I will provide an update to timelines as soon as I am able to do so.ldquoWe will prioritise delivering the Scottish Child Payment and we will do everything humanly possible to deliver this payment as soon as practicably possible.\"This new payment will play a major part in tackling child poverty, helping those who may be facing even more hardship as a result of coronavirus, and our remaining resources will be directed at that.Scottish Conservative social security spokesman Graham Simpson said the move was disappointing but understandable.The Gender Recognition ReformBill, which has now been shelved, had outlined plans for transgender people to receive a Gender Recognition Certicate through self-declaration after six months rather than requiring medical evidence and a two-year period of living as that gender.The proposed Circular Economy Bill, which was put forward to bring in measures to cut litter and waste, will not now be introduced in this current parliamentary session, nor will legislation that aimed to make Scotland a \"good food nation\".Mr Dey said while these were \"important Bills\", the current coronavirus outbreak with \"unknown timescales and consequences\" means \"we very regrettably need to pare back legislation and focus on the immediate term\"."},{"url":null,"title":"research-1m-small-firms-close-inability-get-bank-loans","story":"Research involving , firms, published today, from the Corporate Finance Network, which represents independent accountancy firms, suggests as many as one million businesses nationwide could go under because they will not be able to get emergency loans from banks or,they can, the cash will not arrive in time.The big lenders insist they are following the rules on making the loans as set out by the Government.

Alison Thewliss, its Treasury spokeswoman, said it was ldquoabsolutely crucial businesses in Scotland and across the UK could access funds in time. The Glasgow MP called for Rishi Sunak to urgently set out how the Treasury would respond to businessesrsquo concerns and ensure funding was delivered on the ground.Last month, the Chancellor said business managers would be able to walk into bank branches and discuss Coronavirus Business Interruption loans of up to poundm to help them survive the lockdown.Mr Sunak said: ldquoAny good business in financial dficulty which needs access to cash to pay their rent, the salaries of their employees, pay suppliers, or purchase stock, will be able to access a government-backed loan, on attractive terms.\"Yet, many firms under the threat of closure say they are unable to contact their banks by phone or,they can, are told by the banks they are not eligible for the leline. Claims have been made that banks are charging interest on loans as high as  per cent.UK Finance, the bank trade body, said: \"Lenders are working hard to get financing to all businesses who need it as quickly as possible and are using the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme where appropriate, with some funding having already been provided under the scheme.It added: \"All lenders will take into account a businesss inidual circumstances when considering applications and many business loans can be provided either unsecured or secured on business assets.\"But Kirsty McGregor of the Corporate Finance Network, told the BBC: \"Small and medium-sized businesses employing less than  people employ most of the workforce: m people.\"We could lose up to a million of them in the next month or so.

This could save up to four million jobs, maintain commerce and turn it around once the lockdown ended.Ms Thewliss said: ldquoIt is absolutely crucial that businesses across Scotland and the UK can access the finance they need now to pay their costs and stay afloat. This is an issue we have been raising for weeks.\"Thousands of small and medium-sized businesses are facing unacceptable barriers and delays, which could force them to closethey are not resolved urgently.\"The Chancellor must outline how the UK Government will respond to ensure firms get the cash they need. We cannot allow good businesses to go to the wall because support isnt provided in time that would be a disaster for the businesses, their staff and the wider economy.She added: \"It is also important that the right financial support is available with more grants as well as loans to reflect the fact that businesses are losing income, not just seeing it deferred.\"People need jobs and businesses to go back to after this crisis.

Take a walk in the park. What fun it is to scan the horizon for strangers and wonderthey are infected or not. By the time they are close it will be too late, so better turn tail now.It is better than virtual reality, and you dont have to wear a headset.Best of all is the way this crisis has finally allowed Britain to wallow in the era it loves best ndash the Second World War.Encouraged by Boris Johnson and his Ministers, the public has been urged to embrace the Blitz spirit and keep smiling through. Its Britain this and Britain that, and we are one big happy family living in a Dadrsquos Army world.That was the script for the first week of lockdown, anyway. Now there is a new mood gathering, and not before time.: How Scotland hit deaths recordIt was understandable in the early phases of this crisis that there should be a rush to suspend politics as usual. The first PMQs and FMQs as the extent of the emergency emerged were models of restraint, civility and supportiveness.In journalism too, as in society at large, there was an instinctive reluctance to point fingers. Given the enormity of what has happened, and the rate at which the pandemic has unfolded, many have been, again understandably, stunned into quietude and acquiescence. Surrounded by so much suffering and loss it seemed almost trivial, unhelpful even, to fret over details. Everyone was trying their best in a situation none of us had experienced before.We knew this already from the experience of South Korea and Singapore. We know, too, that testing is vital in getting self-isolating NHS staff back to workthey have had the all-clear.: Edinburgh festivals cancelledBut here we are, some  days later ndash a relative eternity in terms of this virus ndash and governments in London and Edinburgh are failing to hit their targets on testing. There were supposed to be , people tested a day, building to ,. Even this was pathetically low compared to Germany, which can carry out three times that. Yet the UK cannot even hit the lower mark. On Monday,  people were tested. There are not enough kits and labs to ramp up testing to the level required. This is not the first time that reality has failed to match government promises. Remember the antibody test that would tell peoplethey had had the virus and were now most likely immune  The one described by Boris Johnson on March  as a ldquogame-changer  The Prime Minister said trials could start within a month. Weeks on, how close are we to a roll out of these tests Then there is the great Personal Protective Equipmentmystery. Every day a Minister or health official stands at a podium in Downing Street and reels out the statistics on how many masks are available, how many aprons. Millions and millions we are told.Yet also every day, NHS and social care staff are reporting that they do not have the equipment that gives them a fighting chance of staying safe and well. It is scandalous in a supposedly advanced, wealthy society that NHS doctors have to set up a crowdfunding site to buy essential items. Well done and god bless the likes of Scots actor James McAvoy who donated pound, to the campaign, but it should not be necessary in the first place.: Warning on small firmsOn all these matters, and more, governments must be held to account. With Westminster and Holyrood going into recess, and possibly sitting for fewer days when they , it is even more essential that the media is allowed to do its job.We have, of course, the daily press conferences in London and Edinburgh. While vital, they have their limitations, the most obvious of which is the lack of follow-up questions. Time and again the questions being asked are not answered, but there is no comeback and the show rolls on.What is required, in addition to these daily press conferences, are extended interviews with Ministers. Some have taken place, but more are needed, particularly ones where the questioner can drill down for answers. Never has Andrew Neil been more missed than now.It should be said that some of our politicians are reacting to this crisis better than others. Even those who disagree with her on much  would have to concede Scotlandrsquos First Minister has been a been a model of clarity and a reassuring presence throughout.As for the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, there is much talk of a vigorous, ordered response, but once again there is a large gap between the rhetoric and the reality.There will come a time for reckoning on this pandemic, locally, nationally and globally. That could be a long way down the road. Many will have to account for what they did, or did not do, in this crisis and explain how vital time was lost in preparing for it.In the meantime, the public has to feel sure it is being told everything it needs to know, and that the steps being taken by governments are the right ones. We need answers, yes, but we need a lot more questioning besides.The public is ready, willing and able to do the right thing during this lockdown.

The programme reveals that at the same time, Cass brother Martin was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease putting a crushing strain on both and leading to a dficult conversation over whether they could continue their pioneering work.The pair resolved to carry on, however, Cass brother died a few months later aged just , and in February last year Laura received the devastating news that partner Kat had taken her own le.The documentary highlights how the loss of former player Kat sent waves of shock and grief right through the club, leaving players and coaching staff battling to cope.Club manager Laura said: ldquoThe day Kat died is the worst day of my le and always will be. Kat was my world.ldquoWhen you lose that one thing that is the real reason to get you up in the morning, you realise that you dont get as much enjoyment out of stu#.ldquoWhen something good happens to me or something quirky, the only person I want to tell it to, is Kat, but shes not there to tell anymore and its really challenging. I really miss her.Despite being born in dferent decades and dferent cities, both grew up with a razor-like focus for football which was confounded by a male-dominated sport, with only a handful of female role-models and a dearth of opportunities to take part.Cas, who as a youngster is recalled pushing a football instead of a doll in her toy pram, met Laura in the s when both played for Glasgow Universityrsquos womenrsquos football team.The two ndash described in the programme as like a ldquocomedy double act - found a shared determination to confront the lack of equal opportunities in the sport, leading to them hatching a kitchen table plan to create a club of their own.Glasgow City chairperson Cas, , from Newlands in Glasgow, said: ldquoI just remember thinking, Ive just got to change it. Ive just got to do something to make this possible and keep pushing forwards so that it is possible because its not fair.Laura, , from Clarkston in East Renfrewshire, adds: ldquoEven as a young kid, I would never accept that girls shouldnt be allowed to do something, even though everyone perceived that as the norm, I certainly didnt perceive it as the norm and I set out to change it.Glasgow City FC won the league in its inaugural season and is now the most successful club in the country with  domestic league titles to its name and a thriving academy facility offering training for girls.While the clubs closest competition in recent years has come from Hibs, moves by Rangers and Celtic into professional womens game has raised the stakes, setting the scene for a season which, had Covid- not happened, would have been one of the most competitive for years.Professor Karen Boyle, Professor of Feminist Media Studies and Programme Director for the MSc in Applied Gender Studies at University of Strathclyde, said the Glasgow City pioneers arrived at a time when equality was entering a new phase.\"In the Nineties, there was this sense of oh, weve done that, equality is done. We had Blairs babes, we had girl power, we had this sense that actually, equality had been achieved which of course was a complete fiction,\" she said.\"Particularly in arenas like sport, the advances that had been made were so, so tiny, there was still so much of a way to go. I think it made it even more challenging to do work on womens rights in that period.\"What theyre up against is age-old stereotypes about who girls and women are and what they can and cant do and also what football is and who football is for.\"Writer, producer and director of the documentary, Margot McCuaig, said: Since childhood, Cas and Laura have pushed against stereotypical perceptions that football is a mans game and have worked hard to break down gender barriers.\"In realising their ambition to create their own football club they have subsequently created opportunities for girls to follow their dreams in a welcoming environment.\"The Women Who Built Glasgow City is on BBC ALBA on Sunday, April  at pm and later on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-national-piping-centre-asks-pipers-play-scotland-brave-tonight-key-workers","story":"The National Piping Centre is asking musiciansto take to their gardens, front doors or living rooms and play Scotland The Brave at pm on Thursday.It follows last Thursday were people across the country clapped and cheered for key workers and NHS staff.:Timeline of events one month after first positive COVID- caseA spokesman for the centre said: \"This rousing tune will demonstrate the gratitude to key workers across the nation, supporting those who are helping to fight the COVID- pandemic, as well as hopefully fortying them to carry on through this tough time.\"\"So grab your pipes and join The National Piping Centre at pm BST on Thursday nd April and Pipe Up for Key Workers by playing Scotland the Brave for #NHStheBrave.\"Are you joining in  Video your performance and sendto eleanor.duffy@newsquest____________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing.

As a result, we’ve had to take the decision to focus our efforts on the collection and disposal of household and commercial waste, while suspending our recycling services.”The following changes will be made:Mr Richardson added: “In normal times, we greatly appreciate the efforts people make to recycle a wide range of household and commercial items. But these are far from normal times, which is why we’ve had to make the dficult decision to suspend our recycling services.“We are not the only Council making this move, and we understand that  of the  local authorities across Scotland are also working on revised arrangements.“We are asking folkat all possible to store their recycling until these services can begin again. We’re aware that this won’t be an option for everyone, but we would ask that recyclable items are only included as a last resort on grey bin collection days.”He added: “People will be disappointed, and we apologise for the inconvenience these measures will cause. But in these unprecedented times, there is a need to ensure we can continue with the most essential operations with a limited workforce during the weeks and months ahead.“We ask all businesses and householders to be considerate during this time and to make every effort to minimise the waste that is put out for collection, bearing in mind that higher than normal volumes can cause delays and missed collections for other households and businesses.“We are extremely grateful for your co-operation during this dficult period and also for the efforts of our office and depot staff, crews and drivers, who are already going above and beyond in providing vital waste collection services under extremely challenging conditions.”Any further changes will be announced through local media, on the Council website and using OIC’s social media channels.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Treatments at these centres will be largely limited to extractions or draining abscesses. Richard Graham, chair of the BDA#s NI General Dental Practice Committee, said: This is a very stressful time for everyone, dental teams included, so we are very proud of colleagues who are in the forefront of finding a solution for people in dental pain.

This is due to the requirement to both appoint a consultant to prepare a demolition scheme and procure a contractor to undertake the work.One of the neighbouring blocks in the Newtownabbey estate is also earmarked for demolition.The spokesperson added: In the Housing Executive#s Tower Blocks Action Plan, it is proposed to also demolish the adjacent Abbotscoole House. As with the decision on Monkscoole House, this will require departmental approval of a business case.We currently propose to retain Carncoole House and Glencoole House for a period of at least  years, and undertake associated improvement works.Macedon councillor Dean McCullough said that he was delighted to second the motion.He reported that approximately  residents, who are concerned about the possibility of not being rehoused in the locality, attended the public meeting.Mr McCullough also highlighted an existing waiting list for homes in the area.That is why we are saying there is a housing crisis and what needs to happen is Department for Communities needs to work in partnership with ourselves and residents to come up with innovative ways to ensure that regardless of what happens, the people of the multi-storeys can stay within the locality, he said.The multi-storeys should not be demolished. There should be adequate resources put in place to bring them up to standard.They are an iconic part of the fabric of Rathcoole.We have made it clear, this is not acceptable.

We are extremely proud of all our staff who are working in refuge, registration, cemeteries, reception and other front facing services, he said.We have many staff who are continuing to work from home ensuring that when this crisis is over we can bounce back as quickly as possible.Our senior management team are regularly briefing party leaders as things change and evolve and we are supporting them as decisions are being made very quickly. We are proud our facilities are being used to help our NHS and will continue to play our role in dealing with this crisis.His words were echoed by Mr Cuthbertson who also questioned the expense of such an operation. The erection of dual language signage, like many tasks the Technical Services Team are tasked with daily, are most definitely not essential services, he said.The council#s priority at this stage is to maintain the bin collections and support the community, he added.In the past I have raised the issue of costs of these signs, figures often quoted by council are not a true picture when you take into consideration the consultation, procurement and delivery stages.Mid Ulster District Council has been asked to confirm whether the installation of further street signs has now been suspended.When initially asked on Monday what the total cost of these signs were andcouncil considered the work to be essential at this time, a spokesperson for Mid Ulster District Council provided the following statement on Monday.Where resources and social distancing restrictions allow, we have continued to deliver services, from grass-cutting and litter picking to property management activity, including the erection of street name plates which had previously been agreed, ordered and received into stock, the statement said.Two were erected on the Annaghmakeown Road at a cost of £.Belfast Most ReadFamous Northern Ireland faces share photos from past as part of latest social media crazePSNI#s George Clarke leaves force to #pursue other opportunities#Arrest after disturbance at Belfast shopChurch minister sues Belfast hotel after it #calls a halt# to religious eventWoman#s teeth knocked out during Belfast robbery, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"uk knocks back eu belfast office request for irish sea border checks","story":"EU and UK officials are meeting to discuss how arrangements will operate after the transition period ends.

April   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAn EU request to establish an office in Belfast has been rejected by the UK, it has been reported.RTE reports the bloc asked to set up an office in the city in order to ensure agreements made in the withdrawal deal were being followed.The protocol would see checks carried out on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain to determinethey were to enter the EU through the Republic. It#s reported the EU wants a physical presence, which would have customs and veterinary staff, saying there is provision in the protocol for such an office.That provision states the EU shall have a right to be present and the UK would facilitate such a presence. Brussels officials believe this entails an office, however, officials on the UK side said this could lead to joint patrols and a permanent presence.The EU, it is believed, is to insist on an office in order to assure member states the agreement is being followed.RTE reported the matter was raised at the first teleconference of the EU-UK joint committee which is tasked with working out the finer points of how the Irish protocol will work at the end of the transition period. A UK government spokesperson said: We received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February. We have since received a follow up letter to which we will respond in due course.Before the UK#s departure from the EU in January, the EU Commission had an office on Bedford Street in the city centre. EU officials told RTE they understood the sensitivities around having an office in Belfast, given the political tension in Northern Ireland since the Brexit referendum, and given that there would not be similar offices in Edinburgh and Cardf.A UK government spokesperson said: We received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February.

Only two people and a member of the clergy are allowed to attend funerals.Other than for burials, cemeteries will be closed.

The Foyle MLA said:Many Northern Ireland businesses are struggling to survive the coronavirus pandemic. The British government put in place emergency measures, which should assist them. These measures are welcome, however many businesses are coming to me and saying that they are having serious dficulty in accessing these schemes in the way they are supposed to operate.” I have written to Economy Minister, DianeDoddsMLA asking her to press the UK government to urgently stress to banks across theUK that they must do more to enable local businesses to access the funds they need. Many businesses will struggle to survive this pandemicwe do not act quickly. We are dealing with a health emergency, but it is fast becoming an economic emergency.” googletag.cmd.push In the letter, the Foyle MLA says she received representations from several businesses in recent days, who have expressed concern at the responses from banks in Northern Irelandregardingthe operation of UK government support schemes.Those concerns include banks tellingbusinesses they can only access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemethey fail to meet criteria for a loan from that bank under normal lending terms, which may be signicantly more expensive and which the business may not wish to engage in. A number of banks have told businesses they are not engaging in the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or are only doing so for sums much less than the poundm maximum specied by the government. googletag.cmd.push Many businesses are too large to access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, but not large enough to access the Bank of England scheme for larger companies. Some banks are only considering applications under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme from existing customers. In addition, businesses - and homeowners with mortgages - who are being given holidays on loan repayments, but no extension on theof term of the repayment, are finding they are faced by higher monthly repayments at the end of the crisis, when they are still likely to be struggling financially.We believe that these are systemic problems with the government’s measures of support, which need to be addressed by the UK government with participating banks and building societies. It is our understanding that these problems are not unique to Northern Ireland and are the same for businesses operating in Great Britain, the SDLP representative added.Indeed, Lord Leigh of Hurley has made similar points in relation to the attitude of banks in Great Britain. He has issued a statement saying:“I am hearing that the banks are being very uncooperative. They have been seeking personal guarantees, although some have now relented. I have heard of one bank who told a customer that although their turnover was below poundm they had more than  employees and were therefore ineligible. Likewisestart upsand new tech companies will never get it as they have no profit history, indeed some no revenue yet!Clearly the banks are not keen on these loans. They would rather encourage customers to take a regular product, on which of course they can charge fees as opposed to the CBLS.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

cook everything, not just heating beans in a microwave or a boiling an egg but proper gravy with stock and cornflour.So wondering what to do with your children this week. … there’s your answer.Mum also said that meal times were much more family times, when everyone would come together, sit together and talk, sounds great to me.We are all so busy now that I wonder, when did you last sit at the table together and talk - so another good point.What about home grown food too - we used to eat a lot of this but as le has got busier this skill seems to have faded away, is this the perfect time to order seeds or shoots to plant and grow potatoes, peas, beetroot, onions, peppers or tomatoes  I remember my mum teaching me the games she used to play, so why not teach your children too - great excuse to turn the TV or computer off and play.What about Pick Up Sticks, Cat’s Cradle, Marbles, Jacks, Dominos and Cascading Dominos, or card games such as Chase The Ace, Cheat or the Matching Memory Game or even building with the cards.For outside, what about Hop Scotch, skipping rhymes and games with a skipping rope or two tennis balls against a wall - A Sailor Went To See See See, To See What He Could See, See See .. the song went on and you had to do the actions whilst still throwing and catching the two balls.Or another, sing “Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, next door neighbour carry on” and your friend would move in catching and throwing the balls without breaking the rhythm.Or try clapping games together like Say Say My Playmate.Or making obstacle courses or dens - children of any age love dens especiallythey can have lunch in there too.And do you remember making perfume from flower petals or paper mache Or on wet days what about learning to knit, or do knitting dolly, sew, crochet or even try tongue twisters, Betty Botter bought some butter but she said this butters bitter,I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter, so she bought a bit of butter better than the bitter butter and she put it in her batter and her batter was not bitter, so twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter .Don’t forget the board games too like Cludo or Mouse Trap, Ludo or Snakes And Ladders - maybe you could make the boards yourselves too!In the olden days we used to write to each other too - not email, text, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram!So why not encourage, or help, your child to discover the enjoyment of writing and receiving letters They could write about the fun you’ve been having whilst you are offand maybe include a picture they’ve done, then pop it in the post to their friends, grandparents or other family members We used to get pocket money for ‘jobs’ we did too - not just pocket money for the sake of it!Maybe your children could earn pocket moneyby washing the car, fence painting or weeding .So the ‘olden days’ sound like they had a lot to offer, they’ve also got your history too, why not investigate and create a family tree or look up what used to be in your area - what did it look like a  years ago, what did schools and homes look like and transport too, what did people do for fun, apart from the above of course.In doing and enjoying all these ‘olden day’ activities maybe you’ll inspire your child with a love of history, a love of finding out, a love of baking, cooking, gardening and maybe, most importantly of all, a love of being in a family where people talk and play and enjoying being together.P.S. in the olden days many people would have just put baby in a pram in the garden - don’t do this.And young toddlers and young children were cared for and played with by older children and teenagers - do do this and have some peace!Have a safe and healthy week everyone x. googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

It read: “During the disturbances of  it enjoyed comparative tranquillity.” Anyone living in the County Derry town at the time of the ill-fated United Irishmen rebellion would no doubt disagree. The ins and outs of the  rebellion were played out at a local level across the country, something local historian Joseph McCoy thinks is not mentioned enough in schools. He says: “I understand the necessity to look at the First and Second World Wars, but they have so little about the place we’re living in, particularly the local stuff. googletag.cmd.push “The story of  in Maghera is complex. There’s a whole plethora of dferent writers on the subject but no two stories are the same. That tells me that they are pulling a lot from folklore.” Troops had been stationed in the town before the rising began in June  and the rebellious plans were being drawn up around them. An account of how recoat army captain Francis Lamont met and married the daughter of hotel proprietor Jack O’Neill bears testament to this. Captain Lamont, second in command to Colonel Leith, had been passing what is now known as Walsh’s, when he found himself transfixed by a young girl working in the hotel. googletag.cmd.push When she ed his glance, the captain turned to his superior and told him in no uncertain terms thatshe were not yet married, she would be his we. The pair were married in May  and Lamont was named on a list of people who donated to the building of Glen chapel, where the couple rest in the graveyard. It was certainly not the last time love flourished with a meeting of eyes in Walsh’s Hotel.  History and folklore have weaved a rich tapestry of tragedy, violence, compassion and love at the foot of the Glenshane in . The town was so involved in the skirmishes that after the uprising failed, Colonel Leith’s redcoat army may have planned to reduce it to rubble in retribution. In an article for the Maghera Times, a local historical paper, Joseph McCoy wrote: “Initial suggestions tell us that the army was prepared to blow the town to pieces with a detachment of cannon, which had been placed on top of a hill overlooking the town.” However, Maghera was spared, and the people lived to pass on the tales of the rebellion’s leaders in the town, many of whom suffered reprisals in its aftermath. Rev. John Glendy  Rev. Glendy provided leadership to the volunteers in the years leading up to , which led to James Spottswood of the Salters Company in Magherafelt admonishing him in print in . He wrote: “Glendy of Maghera is tainted with the blackest principles of revolution. His many sermons are but discourses containing treason. “We have seen him on erse occasion with the Popish priest of Magherafelt in that union of the Romish Church with whom he does conspire against this Realm.” Glendy composed the oath sworn by all members of the United Irishmen, and at some meetings, stood behind a pulpit bearing the legend ‘vive la Republique’, in a nod to the French revolution. As expected, the hunt for Glendy in the aftermath of the rebellion was an earnest one. He fled to a place called the Grove where he stayed with a man named Wilson for a fortnight. One popular account of how Glendy evaded capture was by borrowing a petticoat, cloak, bonnet and stockings from a woman named Sarah MacQuirken and escaping dressed as a woman. His escape was almost foiled when a local magistrate called Forrester recognised him, but his Presbyterian colleague, Clark, restrained him from making an arrest. The unusual attire also helped him evade a passing redcoat patrol in Tobermore, but his fate was sealed when troops surrounded a friend’s house and he was forced to hand himself in. Glendy was imprisoned on a barge moored in Belfast Lough before being exiled in America, where he became chaplain to the US House of Representatives in  and the Senate in . He passed away in Philadelphia in October  and is buried in Baltimore. Walter ‘Watty’ Graham  Synonymous with the GAA tradition in Glen, the name Watty Graham is familiar in Maghera and its surrounds. Graham was an Elder in the local Presbyterian church and had been central to organising the rebellion’s activity in Maghera. After it was quelled, his house was set on fire in reprisal and after a bounty of pound was placed on his head, he set off for Magilligan, from where he intended to travel to Moville. En route, he stopped at the Rectory of Tamlaght, where he intended to collect pound that the occupier, Mr Church owed him. Mr Church said he would have to go to Maghera to get the money but, in truth, intended to turn him into the authorities in a bid to clear his debt and collect a handsome reward. A servant girl overheard Church telling his we of the plan, and he swore her to secrecy, but the girl found a way to warn Watty Graham of the betrayal. In his book ‘Famous Maghera Men, Eoin Walsh writes how the girl warned Graham using the phrase ‘A herring was never taken on bait’. Graham attempted to evade capture by grabbing a shovel from a nearby workman and telling him to run instead. The soldiers followed the workman, but the Rector spotted the ruse and alerted the soldiers to Graham’s presence. He was swtly arrested. Watty Graham was executed, decapitated and his head carried through the town of Maghera in an intimidatory warning to local supporters of the United Irishmen. His relatives are thought to have retrieved his remains and buried them. Mr Chuch did not live long to enjoy the fruits of his betrayal and was bludgeoned to death at the entrance to his avenue while attending a call to tend to a dying parishioner. William ‘Billy’ Cuddy  In the swirling air of mistrust that prevailed after the rebellion, suspicion was easily aroused, and it cost the le of an innocent man in Billy Cuddy. “An unseasonable jest cost him his le,” wrote Joseph McCoy in his Maghera Times article. Cuddy, a wheelwright and blue dyer by trade, had been employed to insert a pane of glass into a leaden window-frame and remarked that it would not be dficult to turn the lead into bullets. The owner of the house reported him to local clerical magistrate called Clotsworthy Soden, who had him arrested and sentenced to death. “Billy Cuddy had a fairly good relationship with the townsfolk, even the soldiers,” says Joseph. “Colonel Leith, commander of the royalist forces in Maghera, understood that Clotsworthy Soden was maybe overstretching his authority, but it was authority he had. “As they were taking him to his death, he recited the nd psalm at the top of his voice referring to the Rector being to blame for his downfall.” Colonel Leith asked Cuddy on the gallowshe wanted to leave the case in his hands. Many watching on considered it to be an act of mercy, but Cuddy tragically misunderstood the offer. He declared he would ‘leave it to a Higher Power’. Leith deemed that this was a rejection of his offer and William Cuddy was hanged. No further indignity was inflicted on his body though, and local tradition has it that he was cut down from the rope while still alive, nursed back to health and spirited away to America. A mock funeral is said to have been held in Maghera, and a weathered stone in the old St Lurach’s church bears the inscription ‘The Burying Place of William Cuddy’. The names of Glendy, Graham and Cuddy will not catch the eye of many modern-day history students, but they are ingrained in the town of Maghera and its rich history from this period. Their heroic and tragic stories will continue to be passed from generation to generation and the tangible history of Maghera’s United Irishmen will endure.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John Wade works in St Jerome Bilingual School in Harrow, London and has put together learning packs for all year groups, from Primary  to Primary . “I started offering free resources to try and help parents out,” he told Derry Now. “I’m teaching in a school, but I also do some tutoring online and on a one-to-one basis as well. “Everyone was really worried about their children not being able to go to school and even when the schools were still open, they were pulling them out. googletag.cmd.push “There is only so much the schools can do, so I’ve put these packs together from Primary  right through to Primary . It’s just a way of trying to help people out. “ The rapidly moving situation has caused confusion in all schools across the UK but John says the school have been supportive, especially with him being away from home. “I was worried about trying to get home at Easter to see family but the school I’m in have been brilliant, they’ve advised us as much as we can. “No one really knew what was going on. It’s been hectic because you’re trying to get things ready for the children in school as well and then you didn’t knowit was closing or not. googletag.cmd.push “It’s really dficult because even the headteachers don’t know what’s going on. It’s important that parents understand that schools are doing their best to react too.” Any parents interested in John’s resources can get in touch through his Facebook page John Wade Primary Tutoring.

Vincent Rainey, from Dunloy, Co Antrim, began hosting the quizzes from his Facebook page last week, with much of the country already in self-imposed lockdown. The mortgage advisor says the idea stemmed from a throwaway comment while enjoying a glass of wine with his family to relieve the boredom of lockdown. He said: “Catherine, Lauren and I were having a chat over a glass of wine. “Quizzes are my hobby and I just had this random notion about doing a live broadcast, which I’d never done before.” googletag.cmd.push Engagement was central in Vincent’s thinking when building the idea. He wanted to ensure that those living in isolation, particularly those living alone, had access to some interaction. He said: “A lot of people are on their own and I want to try and make sure that they are socially involved, particularly those people who are really on their own. “It’s about figuring out ways for people to communicate with their friends and family, so they are not isolated.” The quiz was launched on Saturday, March  and over  people tuned into the online broadcast, but Vincent says he had a bit of homework to do before he got going. googletag.cmd.push “I YouTubed it,” he admits. “I have loads of content, having done this for a number of years, but I’d never done a live feed, so I had to figure out even how to do that!” The Dunloy man says the experience of hosting an online quiz is a dferent experience for someone used to the more social environment of a pub or hall. “I was quite apprehensive doing it online for the first time,” he said. “In a pub, or on a stage, you can gauge your audience, so you knowthey’re engaged. You can tell by body language their level of interest. “The only way you can check online is through comments and reactions, but that’s good because you want to know you’re not making a complete ass of yourself!” Watching along in another room in the house is Vincent’s we Catherine and daughter Lauren, and with the help of technology, son Josh joins them from Canada. “We just go into a dferent room and it all works well,” said Catherine. “Our son lives in Winnipeg, Canada and got in touch through Facebook Messenger. On one phone we had the quiz coming up and on the other we had a live chat open with Josh. “That conversation makes things much easier and much more satisfying. You can see the other person’s face and engage. The quiz’s reach is growing steadily, with Saturday night engaging over  eager participants, and Vincent is beginning to reach a global audience from his kitchen. He said: “I saw messages from New York, Houston in Texas and there was someone  joining in from Chicago, so there is beginning to be an international feel.” You can increase the Derry contingent by getting involved.

Caitriacuteona Lagan, from Castledawson, won the U All-Ireland mandolin title at the  Fleadh in Drogheda and is usually found playing at a session every weekend. Due to the measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus, however, she has ploughed her efforts into performing online and sharing much-needed positivity. Caitriacuteona told the County Derry Post that it was vital to keep people’s spirits up at this time. She said: “I think it’s very important to keep playing because it can cheer people up and help them to take their minds off things. It makes them feel better. googletag.cmd.push “It’s nice to keep children happy and, instead of all the technology, give them something  to do as well.” The -year-old recently posted a video of her playing a few tunes for the children of Kilronan Special School in Magherafelt. Her mother, Roisiacuten, said Caitriacuteona had a great fondness for the children at Kilronan, having held charity events and performed there before. She said: “After she won the All-Ireland, we didn’t really get a chance to play any events, so for her th birthday she wanted to have a big session. “We don’t have any connections with Kilronan or anything, but she had met a few children at sessions who went to it. googletag.cmd.push “She did a charity night and then was invited up to the school and the summer scheme, so she’s been up and they know her. “She decided, in order to keep her practice up, she would share some videos online. It’s a good way for her to practise and it’s good for her confidence too. One thing that Caitriacuteona will miss out on this year is the annual series of Fleadhanna – county, provincial and All-Ireland – which have had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. She said: “I’m a wee bit disappointed because I love going to the festivals because the atmosphere is so good at them. “I’m using the time to catch up with my schoolwork, take my dogs for a walkI can, do a wee bit of painting, bake at some point, practise my music. “I play a few dferent instruments – banjo, mandolin, fiddle, guitar and piano.” Caitriacuteona’s mum Roisiacuten said that social media has been a godsend for the music community during this time. “At the minute it’s the only way people are able to connect. A lot of Caitriacuteona’s friends would be in the music scene, and she would be at sessions every week, so she’s missing that. “With the Fleadh not being on this year, there’s going to be a massive gap. We normally plan our whole year around the fleadh, so the music is great for everyone to keep spirits up.” Caitriacuteona is certainly helping to keep spirits up, and Roisiacuten said a few children had already been in touch via social media. “A wee boy this morning sent her a rainbow, so hopefully they keep coming and keep children and adults occupied.” You can keep up to date with Caitriacuteona’s videos via her Twitter and Facebook accounts.

In recent days, the debate around essential services has been widely raised with no further clarity emerging for businesses and employees. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The situation is getting more confusing by the day. We have had many businesses in the North West impacted because of this confusion. The supply chain to all essential services is broad and it incorporates a vast number of companies in many sectors. “Take for example the food supply chain. That does not just consist of places that produce foodstuffs, but there is also a huge supply chain supporting it from those that produce agricultural products, oil companies for heating and keeping lorries on roads, food labelling and packaging, to distribution. If one of these links is broken, it will have an impact on the end product we have on our supermarket shelves. googletag.cmd.push “We must stop demonising businesses for trying to keep essential work going during this crisis and instead work with them to ensure they can keep the business going, whilst also ensuring the safety of employees. “Maintaining essential supplies will protect public confidence that we can feed the nation whilst everyone  is told to stay at home and fight this virus. “We urge the Executive to show leadership and work effectively with businesses and workers to outline what are essential businesses. The establishment of a forum on workplace safety is welcome but we need to see decisions and guidance. With every day that passes, more essential businesses are forced to close.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The council today said there has been an increased pressure on its collections as a result of the current coronavirus crisis. A council spokesperson said: “Our refuse collection service continues to remain operational and we are seeing an increase in calls and queries relating to waste management and are currently looking at a bespoke COVID- waste response mechanism that could assist in dealing with this increased pressure on waste services. “This is currently being scoped out and in the interim period the public are being asked to work with Council to try not to put additional pressure on waste services during this emergency period.” googletag.cmd.push The council said people can help by doing the following: - Please leave your bins out for collection at an earlier time of am to allow crews to get around all households. - Please do not leave out black bags - Council cannot collect additional black bags left beside bins, please use the blue, black and brown bins provided appropriately, making sure to separate waste as usual according to recycling guidelines and dispose of waste responsibly. - You should have adequate bin capacity as long as you are not dumping unnecessary additional items. Please do not put additional pressure on Council waste services resources and staff during this emergency period. googletag.cmd.push To assist the council to limit the spread of the virus, they would encourage the public to • Clean the lids and handles of bins before and after collection. • Dispose of tissues and disposable cleaning wipes separately placing them in two plastic bags, tying and storing inside for  days before putting in the external black bin. • Place all food waste in compostable bags and ensure that they are tied before putting in your BROWN BIN. • Bring bins out either the night before their scheduled collection day or before am on collection day. • Park considerately so lorries can access streets to service bins.

Emily Brizzell, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea  Year  pupils at Limavady High School also gave us their take on the current crisis...  It is strange working from home during lock down, because I don’t have to change classrooms every  minutes and I get to work in my dad’s office out the back of his house. I also get to spend more time with my family, my mum, dad, two sisters and two brothers. Every day I do Home Economics by helping to make dinner and I do Technology out in my dad’s workshop. I miss getting to see other people, my family and my friends, but I can still phone them at any time. I don’t have any homework in the evenings now because I have done it during the day. In the morning I write out my timetable for that day ahead and do PE on YouTube at :am. I miss going out for walks throughout the day, but I find other things to do. By Rebecca Hockley. I    Lockdown over the last week has definitely been one interesting experience. It’s one experience I hope we never have to repeat. One of the positive things about this is I get to watch a lot more TV as well as doing schoolwork during the day. The main thing I miss about school is not being able to see any of my friends until September again. I am still trying to get used to not having to get up at .am every morning and having my lunch at dferent times and especially not having to get a bus. I am also going to miss some of the teachers in our school as well. With a really strange week nearly up, I have to admit the schoolwork isn’t as bad as I thought it was first going to be. Jack Bredin F      When I heard we were going in lockdown I didn’t know what to expect. My first thought was you could not go out of the house except shopping for food. My mum and dad explained to me what lockdown meant. They explained that I could still go outside, but only for one form of exercise. So I choose to run. I feel sad that I am not going to have face to face contact with my friends but I’m lucky to have Wi and I talk to my friends daily. The positive side of lockdown is I get to spend more time with my two brothers and my sister. They are company and together we try to support each other with our home schooling. Lockdown is giving me a chance to help my mum and dad about the house and learn new skills like cooking, cleaning and building. My mum jokes this will make my future we happy! Alex Donnell F   Le under lockdown is very boring because I cannot see my friends or some of my family members. It is also not great because I cant go to school either and see my friends and teachers, but I can get out for some fresh air and I can get lots of things done around the house that I cant get done when I was at school. I do miss the fun at school and getting to see my friends but hopefully sometime soon we will come out of lockdown. Remember to wash your hands and stay at a social distance from each other when you are outside. Alex McMichael F   Social Distancing Le in the fast lane has had to stop We are only allowed out to exercise or shop Wash your hands is the golden rule Never thought Id say that Id miss school My brother’s crying because hes fed up My sisters cracking up with her laptop Everyone is trying to be kind Always keeping the vulnerable in mind Essential staff have had to work Home schooling is driving parents berserk I miss my Grandparents theyre the best At least I am giving their heads a rest It’s now we realise what is important to us No point huffing or puffing or causing a fuss My family is so important to me Just think in a few weeks we can be free For everyone out there please take care This virus could be lurking anywhere Corona Virus is a mystery But please remember we are making History! Jay Scott I   Le under lock down can be very boring but fun at the same time. I don`thave to wake up as early and get to sleep in a bit longer. Idon`t have to move around every half an hour to get to my next class. I can take my time in doing my work and don`t have to rush through everything. Sometimes it can get really annoying, how the time passes really slowly or being stuck in the house in general. Some days I do wish I could go back to school because the time flies by a lot quicker and the day does not feel as long. I have a lot more family time and get to spend more quality time with my sister. I also get to annoy my parents which I do anyway! Amelia Sinclair A   It is a very strange feeling not being able to leave the house, it’s like being imprisoned! I miss playing with my friends and being in school learning alongside them. I am spending more time in my bedroom at my desk working on schoolwork which can feel boring and hard work as I can find learning a challenge! However, being away from school makes me appreciate the help and support I get in school from my teachers. On a positive note, being in lock down I don’t have to wake up as early to catch the bus. My schooling at home is more flexible and I can take a break when I want to. I have been using technology to communicate with my friends. We all arranged a video call together and it was great to see them and have a chat. Having to stay at home with only my family for company means we are spending more time together, eating together, playing together and enjoying our family PE lessons daily with Joe Wicks! We have a laugh together as we exercise. I am trying to stay positive and as a family we are trying to think of fun activities to do together like, going on a bike ride in the countryside, going on walks, do some baking, watching movies and at Easter time we are going to have Easter egg hunt in the garden. Stay positive everyone and keep safe. Isaac Morrison Year    Finally, we have the Taylor family from Limavady, who gave us an account of how children in the same house, but of dferent ages, are reading the situation.  Covid- My name is Harry and I’m a schoolboy during the coronavirus Covid- pandemic. I have to be home-schooled right now because the virus is running rampage. Personally, I think my mummy is a really good teacher. We have to use social distancing to stay safe in shops or pharmacies. This coronavirus outbreak is NOT scary in my eyes. I just think of it as a really bad cold that’s killing the elderly, so it should be called ‘The Elderly Killer’. It was just Monday night when lockdown was put into action in the UK. Also, being home-schooled has its pros and cons. Pros: getting to wear what you want activities every afternoon, sibling humour, your own back garden. Cons: full school day, digital PE. Harry Taylor, , Limavady  My Le Right Now Hello, my name is Molly and I am  years old. Right now there is an illness called coronavirus, also called Covid-. I am being home-schooled. I really hate having no friends in home-school, and no line points. I love still having a textbook, activities, doing PE and having Star of the Week. On Friday, Mummy had to pick up the packs from my school and Daddy works hard and late. Mammy teaches us and soon she might have to go in and look after key workers’ children. She said she might have to bring me and my brother and sister. Molly Taylor, , Limavady   Everything’s Not Normal Hi, my name is Emily and I am  years old. I am being home-schooled right now because of coronavirus Covid-. My mummy is a really good teacher, she makes really fun days for us. My teacher sent me home instructions to make a rain maker. I learnt about how the sun warms up the earth and the water goes up to the sky to make clouds. I am learning to do story writing. I did PE with Joe Wicks on YouTube and we made buns. I miss my swimming. I wrote letters to my friends because I miss them too. I can’t wait until it’s back to normal.

Clodagh Bradley, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Coronavirus Coronavirus, what a funny name All I know is it ruins all our fun and games We can’t go to school in case we get infected Scientists are trying to get medicine to get us injected I miss the park, having sleepovers and playing in the dark Make sure you wash your hands If you don’t it could catch you too. Emily Brizzell, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea  Year  pupils at Limavady High School also gave us their take on the current crisis...  It is strange working from home during lock down, because I don’t have to change classrooms every  minutes and I get to work in my dad’s office out the back of his house. I also get to spend more time with my family, my mum, dad, two sisters and two brothers. Every day I do Home Economics by helping to make dinner and I do Technology out in my dad’s workshop. I miss getting to see other people, my family and my friends, but I can still phone them at any time. I don’t have any homework in the evenings now because I have done it during the day. In the morning I write out my timetable for that day ahead and do PE on YouTube at :am. I miss going out for walks throughout the day, but I find other things to do. By Rebecca Hockley. I    Lockdown over the last week has definitely been one interesting experience. It’s one experience I hope we never have to repeat. One of the positive things about this is I get to watch a lot more TV as well as doing schoolwork during the day. The main thing I miss about school is not being able to see any of my friends until September again. I am still trying to get used to not having to get up at .am every morning and having my lunch at dferent times and especially not having to get a bus. I am also going to miss some of the teachers in our school as well. With a really strange week nearly up, I have to admit the schoolwork isn’t as bad as I thought it was first going to be. Jack Bredin F      When I heard we were going in lockdown I didn’t know what to expect. My first thought was you could not go out of the house except shopping for food. My mum and dad explained to me what lockdown meant. They explained that I could still go outside, but only for one form of exercise. So I choose to run. I feel sad that I am not going to have face to face contact with my friends but I’m lucky to have Wi and I talk to my friends daily. The positive side of lockdown is I get to spend more time with my two brothers and my sister. They are company and together we try to support each other with our home schooling. Lockdown is giving me a chance to help my mum and dad about the house and learn new skills like cooking, cleaning and building. My mum jokes this will make my future we happy! Alex Donnell F   Le under lockdown is very boring because I cannot see my friends or some of my family members. It is also not great because I cant go to school either and see my friends and teachers, but I can get out for some fresh air and I can get lots of things done around the house that I cant get done when I was at school.

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He added: “I have also been in contact with Irwin’s Bakery and I am now receiving some their over produced products on a weekly basis.“I have distributed essentials all over Portadown, along with the aid of Lidl Portadown and the Flower Bowl International, Armagh.“I have already been in contact and delivered personally to a lot of elderly and vulnerable residents across Portadown in this past few days.“It is hard to get food donations in to keep up with the demand which is why I have set up this Just Giving page to anybody that would like to donate a small amount.”He went on to say: “Every £ goes a long way in one of my donation boxes so I don’t have to rely on donations as much.“You are not obliged to donate but every penny counts as I want to get out to as many elderly as I possibly can.”He also promised:“All extra money that is left over will be donated to the Children’s Hospice.”Speaking to the Portadown Times on his motivation for starting the community effort he said “I wanted to help the community, I saw a lot of people going out and just buying for themselves.“I’ve been to a lot of houses and I’m getting plenty of stuff in. Lidl in Portadown have been phenomenal and Irwin’s Bakery have also assisted.”He added: “I’ve assisted over  people and the list I have goes on for page, after page.“I’m going to people in all dferent areas with elderly self isolating.”Tristan manages to get out every few days, when he’s off work and isn’t left with much spare time.He works a  hour week and in his spare time can be doing delivery runs up to  hours a day.He said the people he was helping were really appreciative, some had cried with gratitude.Tristan also takes great care in terms of hygiene and infection control, using hand sanitiser before and after every visit, setting the food deliveries at the door and stepping back.And for Tristan those measures aren’t just about protecting himself and those he is helping but also his dad who suffers from COPD.If you would like to donate to Tristan’s efforts see his Just Giving page, www.justgiving and search PortadownUnite. \"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1585734877583.jpg--minister_highlights_key_findings_of_ni_covid_19_modelling.jpg?158573487700","title":"minister highlights key findings of ni covid  modelling ","story":",\"image\":,\"description\":\"THE crucial importance of social distancing in NI has been graphically brought home by local modelling data on COVID-.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Health Minister Robin Swann has set out key findings of an expert NI modelling study, which will inform intensive hospital planning for the forthcoming surge in COVID- cases. “In summary, the research indicates that our health service would have a realistic prospect of coping in this initial perioda sufficient proportion of the population adhere to the social distancing and self-isolation measures,” Mr Swann said. “However, it is important that this is considered in context, and I would emphasise that it provides no grounds whatsoever for dropping our guard. On the contrary, the projections underline that the continuation of rigorous social distancing will save many lives and protect our health service from collapse. “Even then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le In Northern Ireland. “In addition, the absence of a vaccine means we will have to plan for a potential second wave of COVID- cases later in the year.” The modelling outcome sets out a reasonable worst case scenario, based on a number of assumptions including social distancing measures producing a % reduction in contacts outside the home and workplace. In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation. The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  COVID- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic. The peak number of COVID- hospital admissions would be  per week. Under this reasonable worst case scenario, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The modelling indicates that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic is expected between - April . The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced. This will remain the case until there is substantial population immunity either as a result of recovery from infection or successful vaccination.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_acefccbaaccd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_ccafbabeeebfabed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
