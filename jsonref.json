I love you pretty girl’, while a mobile plays music in the background.True was covered with a filter, putting a flower on her face and butterflies in her cot.But nothing can distract from those adorable chubby cheeks.Of course, the squealing commenced in the comments section, with thousands of fans proclaiming how cute True is.Those Kardashian ladies sure can pop out cuties.Khloe gave birth to True on 12 April, but her arrival was marred by the revelations that Tristan Thompson cheated on Khloe multiple times throughout her pregnancy.The basketball star was filmed kissing Instagram model Lani Blair at a New York cocktail bar just a week before Khloe gave birth, while he is accused of cheating with a total of five women.However, it seems that Khloe has forgiven her baby daddy, as they were seen together enjoying a cinema date this week. If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons ‘name newborn baby boy Ennis Howard’MORE: Did Cardi B just let slip sex of baby?

In case anyone had forgotten, this is the same Chris Brown who plead guilty to beating his then girlfriend, Rihanna, until she bled and even tried to bite a chunk out of her ear.The response to those tweets?A sea of people telling me to ‘chill out’ and ‘get over it.’Apparently being angry about violent assault against women is petty if the assault happened more than a few years ago.Last month Piers Morgan announced that he’d been in conversation with Harvey Weinstein and that they both thought Harvey would soon be rehabilitated.I think he’s right.(Picture: Ella Byworth)I’m accepting the harsh reality that Weinstein will probably be rehabilitated. It’ll take lots of apologising, some therapy, a chat about sex addiction and even then he’ll probably be kept behind the scenes.But I firmly believe that he will work again. For all the awful things he’s accused of doing, he’s also talented. He makes money. And what do people care about more than morality? Money.If you’re still hoping that Harvey might never make his way back, that the way he treated the women around him would be bad enough to condemn him for life, you are, I believe, out of luck. Because whatever a man does, no matter how violent or abusive or horrific his crimes, it seems that he can be forgiven, that the world can move on.Johnny Depp was accused of physically assaulting Amber Heard during their marriage. The actors settled the orce case and the domestic abuse case, but, while Amber was accused of being a ‘golddigger’ (despite donating her orce settlement to charity), Johnny has already been accepted back into the film industry without question.He’s in children’s films – Sherlock Gnomes and Fantastic Beasts. He’s still the face of Savage for Dior.What about Mel Gibson. He was violent and used hideous antisemitic slurs. That’s got to put you on the bench for the rest of your career, right?Nope. It might have taken a few years, but Mel is working again. Because, well he might be violent and hateful, but you saw how good he was in Braveheart, right?(Picture: Ella ByworthGetty Images)It’s different for women.There aren’t many famous women who have blotted their copy books quite so comprehensively as their male co-stars, but let’s take the example of Hollywood’s darling, Winona Ryder.Winona was everyone’s favourite. She could open a film on her own name alone. Then, she shoplifted – she didn’t hurt anyone, use racial slurs or leave anyone bleeding. She stole.Her career ground to a humiliating halt for over a decade. She took a full hiatus for half of the noughties.Now compare that to Woody Allen who cheated on his wife with his adopted daughter, 35 years his junior, and then married her. His daughter Dylan publicly accused him of sexual abuse which allegedly took place throughout her childhood.And yet, he was only thrown out of the Academy last week.Roman Polanski, the film director who was arrested for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl – who fled back to Paris on hearing he was going to be sentenced to prison – still wins awards. He still makes films. He was also only thrown out of the Academy last week. And his response? A threat to sue the Academy.So why does it matter that these men are forgiven?Barca boss Ernesto Valverde compares Neymar\u0027s departure to Andres Iniesta\u0027sBut most importantly, there’s the message that this forgiveness sends.We have consequences for illegal and abusive behaviour, for a reason. We do it as a discouragement, because sadly people cannot be trusted to choose to be kind and respectful.Whilst it’s nice to think that people who do terrible things can say that they’re sorry, atone and move on, that’s often not the case. Just look at Roman trying to sue the Academy or Chris Brown saying he wishes everyone would stop talking about Rihanna.Even if you can atone for what you’ve done, I’m not sure you should be put back on your celebrity pedestal. Doesn’t horrific behaviour forfit the right to be glorified and famous? If you hit a child while drunk driving, you can lose your licence for life. There are certain privileges that you can – and should – lose forever.As long as we continue to forgive the kinds of men who hurt or abuse women, that discouragement just doesn’t stack up. We’re sending an ongoing message that abuse is pretty much okay, as long as you act like you’re sorry afterwards.And really, as long as we’re broadcasting that message to young men, can we be surprised that this systemic, undeniable abuse of women just keeps going on?MORE: If nobody in your house wears nappies then you really should give up baby wipes – and here’s what you should use insteadMORE: Sarah Jessica Parker admits Sex And The City would differ today – and probably have women of colour"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/bus-passenger.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"woman 22 complains man masturbating behind bus driver just tells move seats","story":"A man was caught exposing himself and masturbating in front of a young woman while on a bus in Leeds.    (Picture: News Dog Media)A man was caught exposing himself and masturbating in front of a young woman while on a bus in Leeds. Karlah Louise Daly, 22, was sitting at the front of the upper deck on the no.16 bus to Leeds City Centre yesterday when the man moved closer to her and started pleasuring himself.Shocking footage shows Karlah asking the man to stop performing the sex act yet he continues to harass her.Karlah described how she told the driver bout the incident but claims he simply asked her to sit somewhere else.In fact, the man was allowed to remain on the vehicle even after she left.When the Karlah reported him to the bus driver, he did nothing about it and simply told her to change seats (Picture: News Dog Media)The appalling incident took place on the First UK no.16 bus from Armley to Leeds City Centre around 6.20pm to 6.50pm on Thursday.As the bottom deck of the bus was full, Karlah went to take a seat by the window upstairs.Karlah had been on the bus for ten minutes when the traumatic event happened.The appalling incident took place on the First UK no.16 bus from Armley to Leeds City Centre around 6.20pm to 6.50pm on Thursday.

Clarence hasn\u0027t been used for a long time and it\u0027s been sort of tainted by bad luck.\u0027One Duke of Clarence was the eldest son of Edward VII and there have been a lot of fairly salacious stories surrounding him.\u0027Another Duke of Clarence was executed for treason and allegedly drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.\u0027Connaught, with its links to the Republic of Ireland, might not be suitable at the moment.          Tradition dictates that royal men receive a title on the morning of their wedding – with Harry looking set to become the Duke of Sussex\u0027The dukedoms of Cumberland, Albany and Teviotdale are all suspended, meaning there could be claims to those titles.\u0027Windsor – last used by the abdicated Edward VIII – is likely to be off the table.Although it would reclaim the title for a new generation, Wallis Simpson – the last Duchess of Windsor, who sparked the abdication crisis of 1936 – was, like Meghan, an American orcee.Other options could include Avondale and Kendal.Previously used titles that are available to Prince Harry  are Connaught, Albany, Cumberland, Ross, Kintyre, Kendal, Sussex and Clarence. Connaught is now a province of the Republic of Ireland ans would be very unlikely to be used.  The Duke and Duchess of Windsor´s marriage caused difficulties for the royal family with Edward VIII abdicatingThe previous holders of the titles Albany and Cumberland lost their titles after they fought for Germany during World War I. Their heirs are also alive and hence could disrupt any claims to the title.   Ross and Kintyre have not been used in more than 500 years, and Kendal was only used once used for a baby son of King James II, who died during infancy.  However, the previous Duke of Sussex, Prince Augustus Frederick, holds a lot of parallels with Prince Harry.He was born on the January 27 1773 at Buckingham Palace, the ninth child of King George III and Queen Charlotte. He was given freedom to develop his own interests, like Prince Harry, and supported many liberal causes.    Prince Augustus Frederick, who died in 1843, was the last person to hold the \u0027Duke of Sussex\u0027 titleHe was a strong supporter of anti-slavery legislation among other causes such as electoral reform, Jewish rights and Catholic emancipation.      He died aged 70 on April 21,  1843 at Kensington Palace, where Harry and Meghan now reside. Harry – whose full name is Prince Henry of Wales – could turn down a title, but would be a surprise move. In this case, Meghan would be known as HRH Princess Henry of Wales.She is not entitled to be Princess Meghan because she is not a princess in her own right, only through marriage.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also given titles linking them to Scotland and Northern Ireland, becoming the Earl and Countess of Strathearn and Baron and Baroness Carrickfergus, meaning Harry and Meghan might also be given multiple ones as well."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/16/4C0E4F2300000578-5713953-image-a-6_1525966456420.jpg","title":"Behind scenes footage shows Meghan Markle fits giggles set forgetting lines","story":"    Behind-the-scenes footage of Meghan Markle on the TV drama Suits shows the actress dissolving into fits of giggles, dancing around the set and fluffing her lines          Outtakes from the first six series, show the close friendship between the princess-to-be and her co-stars Patrick J Adams and Sarah Rafferty          The off-cuts of the hit series Suits, which can be found on YouTube , under the titles \u0027Blooper Reel\u0027 or \u0027Gag Reel\u0027 give a fascinating insight into Meghan\u0027s personalityWill Prince Harry shave off his beard in time for the big...The hazard of a dukedom: If Harry and Meghan really want to...Meghan and Harry bring New York to a stand still... sort of:...Share this articleBut she does not appear in as many clips as the rest of the cast, showing how seriously she took her big break in the profession.Meghan, 36, who marries Prince Harry next Saturday, joined Suits in 2011, moving from Los Angeles to Toronto.But she has now admitted that she thought she had blown her audition for the role of paralegal Rachel Zane in the show, originally entitled A Legal Mind.In an interview with listings magazine Fan The Fire, she said: \u0027It was just like any other audition.\u0027I was sent the material and was asked to go and read for the producers.

Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.          Prince Albert and his family worked from top to bottom over the past year-and-a-half to make sure the home properly conveyed the emotional and historical significance it holds for them          On the second floor, four bedrooms including the one where Princess Grace spent her younger years brought back memories for the Prince          Prince Albert gave a tour of the refinished property to the Today Show          Princess Grace Kelly is seen here on January 10, 1956, with her fiance Prince Rainier of Monaco          Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Oscar winner Grace Kelly pose for photographers at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents after the pair\u0027s engagement was announced on January 5, 1956          Prince Rainier of Monaco and film actress Grace Kelly show off the engagement ring to her mother at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents a few days after their announcement          Next to the den, there\u0027s bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern\u0027 Next to the den, there\u0027s a bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern.\u0027 An oar that is believed to have belonged to Princess Grace\u0027s father hangs today above the bar, where the point of his scull is also displayed.In addition to the restorative work, irreplaceable personal touches somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor that survived with etching of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens.          Prince Albert shows Kotb one of the irreplaceable personal touches that somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor          The linen closet door survived with etchings of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens          Though he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure          \u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the familyThough he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure.\u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the family. That is a sweet thought, but it\u0027s not likely all of the previous owners had such charming intentions in the back of their minds.The property made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property.Officials with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals seized 15 cats from the home and found the remains of several others.The owner had lived in the large brick house since 1973.

Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats. Anything new or unknown, until it is proven to be harmless, will therefore be treated with suspicion — even hostility. When you\u0027re in the dynasty business, everything is subjected to the ultimate test: will this personthingideadevelopment help or hinder the survival of the current royal line?          The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need was  essentially accurate. Pictured: Princess Diana and Patrick Jephson in Hungary in 1990It\u0027s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.Why? Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.    Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/00/4C1E329A00000578-0-image-a-24_1526079816392.jpg","title":"Terrified tourists run cover Disney parade","story":"    Video of the incident shows the head of the animatronic beast completely engulfed in fire, moving towards the crowd as black smoke billows to the sky          The attraction is Maleficent\u0027s dragon and part of the Magic Kingdom\u0027s daily Festival of Fantasy parade located in Liberty SquareMaleficent, the self-proclaimed \u0027Mistress of All Evil,\u0027 is a \u0027dark fairy\u0027 who first made her appearance in the Disney animated classic \u0027Sleeping Beauty\u0027 released in 1959.The fire was extinguished by a park employee and the area was cleared for tourists shortly thereafter.

More than a dozen fissures oozing lava have opened in the ground. Adding to the distress, of the 36 structures destroyed, 26 were homes.And now, scientists are warning that an explosive eruption may occur at the summit crater within weeks.Tina Neal, the scientist-in-charge of the U.S. Geological Survey\u0027s Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory, said geologists don\u0027t expect the summit eruption to be life-threatening so long as people stay out of the national park. Volcano and other nearby communities may be showered by pea-sized fragments or dusted with nontoxic ash but they aren\u0027t expected to get hit by large boulders, she said.Robert Hughes, the owner of Aloha Junction Bed and Breakfast in Volcano, said he\u0027s had \u0027tons\u0027 of cancellations since Wednesday when geologists first warned of the explosive eruption.But Hughes, a 45-year resident of the village of some 2,500 people, suspects he\u0027ll soon hear from adventurers and photographers who want to see the eruption up close.\u0027I\u0027m not too worried about it because I\u0027ve lived here so long and I\u0027ve seen it go through lots of different episodes,\u0027 Hughes said.

Coney is anticipating more depending on what happens.There are also further potential risks where lava has been erupting 25 miles  east of the crater in Leilani Estates. Scientists said the molten rock there could start moving faster if fresher, hotter magma emerges from the ground.Neal said a chemical analysis of the lava that\u0027s erupted since last week indicated it\u0027s from magma that had been stored in the ground since a 1955 eruption. It\u0027s been sluggish and somewhat cooler as a result, she said. But Kilauea could release hotter, faster-moving and more voluminous lava because magma has moving into the area from further up the volcano, she said.

Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats. Anything new or unknown, until it is proven to be harmless, will therefore be treated with suspicion — even hostility. When you\u0027re in the dynasty business, everything is subjected to the ultimate test: will this personthingideadevelopment help or hinder the survival of the current royal line?          The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need was  essentially accurate. Pictured: Princess Diana and Patrick Jephson in Hungary in 1990It\u0027s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.Why? Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.    Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/00/4C1E329A00000578-0-image-a-24_1526079816392.jpg","title":"Terrified tourists run cover Disney parade","story":"    Video of the incident shows the head of the animatronic beast completely engulfed in fire, moving towards the crowd as black smoke billows to the sky          The attraction is Maleficent\u0027s dragon and part of the Magic Kingdom\u0027s daily Festival of Fantasy parade located in Liberty SquareMaleficent, the self-proclaimed \u0027Mistress of All Evil,\u0027 is a \u0027dark fairy\u0027 who first made her appearance in the Disney animated classic \u0027Sleeping Beauty\u0027 released in 1959.The fire was extinguished by a park employee and the area was cleared for tourists shortly thereafter.

More than a dozen fissures oozing lava have opened in the ground. Adding to the distress, of the 36 structures destroyed, 26 were homes.And now, scientists are warning that an explosive eruption may occur at the summit crater within weeks.Tina Neal, the scientist-in-charge of the U.S. Geological Survey\u0027s Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory, said geologists don\u0027t expect the summit eruption to be life-threatening so long as people stay out of the national park. Volcano and other nearby communities may be showered by pea-sized fragments or dusted with nontoxic ash but they aren\u0027t expected to get hit by large boulders, she said.Robert Hughes, the owner of Aloha Junction Bed and Breakfast in Volcano, said he\u0027s had \u0027tons\u0027 of cancellations since Wednesday when geologists first warned of the explosive eruption.But Hughes, a 45-year resident of the village of some 2,500 people, suspects he\u0027ll soon hear from adventurers and photographers who want to see the eruption up close.\u0027I\u0027m not too worried about it because I\u0027ve lived here so long and I\u0027ve seen it go through lots of different episodes,\u0027 Hughes said.          Fissures continue to vent an extraordinary amount of toxic gases, creating hazardous breathing conditions in the immediate and downwind areas, Pahoa on Friday.

Coney is anticipating more depending on what happens.There are also further potential risks where lava has been erupting 25 miles  east of the crater in Leilani Estates. Scientists said the molten rock there could start moving faster if fresher, hotter magma emerges from the ground.Neal said a chemical analysis of the lava that\u0027s erupted since last week indicated it\u0027s from magma that had been stored in the ground since a 1955 eruption. It\u0027s been sluggish and somewhat cooler as a result, she said. But Kilauea could release hotter, faster-moving and more voluminous lava because magma has moving into the area from further up the volcano, she said.

But George Szigeti noted that the Big Island is \u0027immense\u0027 and there are large parts of the island unaffected by the volcano.Like the town of Kamuela which is home to vast cattle ranches and Hawaii\u0027s own cowboys, called paniolo.

Old bits of food and what looks like vomit can be seen on the floor          This is another car that seems to be used as a rubbish bin with black bin bags dumped all over the floor of the vehicle.

Although the car is less disgusting than some of the others, it is filled with clutter, some of which could surely be binned          And this car clearly belongs to a smoker with dozens of stubbed cigarettes spread throughout the car with the gear stick also covered in ash. The driver also seems to be a fan of McDonald\u0027s, particulary the fast food restaurant\u0027s drinks          It\u0027s hard to know where to begin with this car, which seems to have almost every inch filled with clutter. However there seems to be just enough space for the driver to squeeze in amidst all of the rubbish filling the vehicle          This is another car that seems to be filled with rubbish with the back seats and passenger seat filled with clutter. Again, the owner of the vehicle seems to have left enough space to squeeze in to drive the car          More than clutter, this car seems to be old and knackered with the seats barely looking like they\u0027d be safe enough to sit in. There even seems to be a mat placed over the driver\u0027s seat, presumably to let them drive without hurting themselves          Some of the photos were taken by disgusted passers-by, including this one which seems to show a car seat filled with dirty clothes as well as a bizarre collection of empty cups with the same branding on them          This car does not look like it would be fun to drive with boxes and bags spilling over the driver\u0027s shoulder from the overstuffed and cluttered back seat. The driver could probably squeeze in to drive but the car should probably be de-cluttered first          This passer-by shamed their neighbour by posting a picture of her car with a passenger seat filled with left over fast food containers and empty drink cans. The floor and dash are also covered in dozens of cigarettes. To make it worse, the poster claims the picture shows the car two weeks after it was cleaned           The driver of this car seems to be a fan of energy drinks with dozens of empty cans dumped on the floor of the vehicle. The seats seem to still be in good condition despite the mountain of mess spread throughout the car          Another photo taken from outside of a vehicle shows a car filled to the top with fast food containers. It looks as if it would be impossible for the driver to look out of the car among the piles of rubbish          There are several photos taken by shocked passers-by, such as this one which shows the disgusting interior of a car. Newspapers, magazines and bags of rubbish can be seen filling the car, with the owner catching the man taking the photo          In several photos, the drivers clearly don\u0027t share their cars often, with this photo another example of a driver filling their passenger side with piles of rubbish and clutter"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/12/4C20EB5D00000578-0-image-m-24_1526123721749.jpg","title":"US bishop asked address Harry Meghan s wedding","story":"Bishop Michael Curry will give an address at next week\u0027s Royal WeddingPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have added a fresh transatlantic twist to their wedding by inviting a senior US bishop to speak at next week\u0027s service.The Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, the 27th presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church, will give an address at the wedding in Windsor on May 19.The preacher, from Chicago, is to attend the service at St George\u0027s Chapel, at which the Archbishop of Canterbury will officiate, Kensington Palace said.The Episcopal Church is an offshoot of the Church of England in the US and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion worldwide.Ms Markle was baptised by the Most Rev Justin Welby ahead of her wedding to the prince, whose grandmother, the Queen, is head of the Anglican Church.Bishop Curry said: \u0027The love that has brought and will bind Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle together has its source and origin in God, and is the key to life and happiness.Michael Portillo\u0027s father is accused of making up famous...Porsche ‘fiddled emissions test to save drivers £225 tax a...Share this article\u0027And so we celebrate and pray for them today.\u0027He is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, is to conduct next week\u0027s service, before Justin Welby officiates as the couple make their marriage vows."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/16/4C22D40800000578-5721385-image-a-2_1526138476453.jpg","title":"Zimbabwe run beer ONE WEEK","story":"    Supplies of Chibuku Shake Shake are running perilously short according to the brewery          The drink, which is made using an old southern African recipe, is popular in ZimbabwePatricia Murambinda, spokesman for the Delta Corporation who brew Chibuku Shake Shake said: \u0027We are facing foreign currency challenges importing concentrates for our business.

The renowned John Hansard Gallery, once out on the verges of Southampton University, to which it belongs, has moved into a specially designed building in the city centre. The exterior and interior are the work of two different architects, the developer went bust and too many cooks were involved in the broth. To describe the project as a long story would be the merest understatement: it has been going on for nearly 20 years.But the good news is that the bad news – the exterior – doesn’t matter. Outside is an undistinguished shop-front of grey bricks speckled with sporadic beige, the default look of so much of today’s high-rise housing (the gallery morphs into flats at the back). Standing opposite is its exact twin, the Nuffield theatre, separated only by a narrow alley of tapas bars. The signage is hideously civic and almost comically inadequate for such important institutions. The name is absurd – why call these two entirely separate venues (three if you count the film charity City Eye) Studio 144? And both the theatre and the main galleries are hoisted up above more cafes and restaurants, as if they could hardly stand on their own two feet.But the interior of the new JHG is as well suited to contemporary art as anything launched in those two decades, from the Turner Contemporary in Margate to the Jerwood in Hastings. Indeed, for art lovers, the south coast is an ever-growing chain of beacons: from Margate, with its exceptional programme, to the Folkestone Triennial and the impressively adventurous De La Warr in Bexhill-on-Sea from the great Towner Gallery in Eastbourne (its funding recently, disastrously, threatened by its own council) to Pallant House in Chichester, with its museum-class British art shows and onward now to Southampton.Considering that Southampton already has its venerable City Art Gallery, housed in the neoclassical Civic Centre, with a permanent collection running from Turner and Monet to Chris Ofili and currently showing George Shaw’s terrific My Back to Nature, you might say the city centre is already rich in art. But unlike practically every other gallery in the world, this one doesn’t open on a Sunday. So there is even more scope for the JHG, which is aiming for six times the modest visitor figures of its campus days.There is underfloor heating for cold weather, a vividly appealing children’s suite and panoramic windows in two spaces to lure a curious public in from the main boulevard outside. The decor is standard white cube – polished concrete, glass, steel and selected Scandinavian wood floors – but the configuration of galleries is excellent. Small rooms open into larger galleries and finally into a colossal double-height prism of a space with picture windows the size of a multiplex screen overlooking the wide piazza below. Crowds gather and disperse, children run, skateboarders race across the pale Portland stone to the colonnaded Guildhall opposite. It’s like being in a box at some vast public theatre.For its inaugural show, the curators have chosen the German art star Gerhard Richter (born 1932). With two-dozen works (or 275, if you include all the panels in two major installations) running all the way back to 1977, this is effectively a condensed retrospective. And because Richter is famously questioning of all the usual distinctions in painting – figurative versus abstract, mechanical reproduction versus painterly touch and so on – it’s a particularly judicious selection.His Mirror paintings, in which pigment adheres to glass, are shiningly reflective in outward appearance yet inherently opaque. Look into them, drawn by their greens, greys and blues, and you see yourself doubled, then mistily silhouetted (they are angled in pairs in gallery corners). The colour recedes and so does the clarity of your own visage.Mustang Squadron shows an array of warplanes flying in formation, in silent black and white. Close by it hangs 14 Feb 45, an aerial image of a cityscape that one cannot quite make out. Are we too high up for visibility, is the photographic print blurred, or are we simply blind to what we see – namely Dresden, bombed on that February day. The analogy between the two images is clear.There are all-grey paintings, their surfaces so flawless they look like photographs of paintings and there are black-and-white photographs of coloured paintings that transform inidual brushstrokes into lunar landscapes. 4900 Colours fills the double-height gallery from floor to ceiling with its panels of coloured squares in innumerable permutations. A vision of apparent estrangement – they look, and are, entirely random – the installation nevertheless holds the eye completely with its glowing-all-over scintillation.The lighting is superb, particularly in the room devoted to 48 Portraits, which have never looked so poignant. A gallery of modern heroes – Wilde, Stravinsky, Mann, Planck – these are facsimiles of black-and-white paintings based in turn on formal photographs, so that the sense of remoteness is deep, as if to ask what the painter could ever know of these people. Yet together they are a shrine to the dead, pivoting on the one mask that turns directly to us: the intensely moving face of Franz Kafka.For such a monastically reserved painter, Richter is extraordinarily prolific. Yet even this relatively small survey carries a full sense of his anxious, doubting intellect. It includes a self-portrait in which Richter is both there and not there, three times over, a photographic ghost haunting his own studio.Richter will be followed by shows featuring the work of John Latham, Anya Gallaccio and Siobhán Hapaska. Philip Hoare, marvellous writer, curator and film-maker, author of Leviathan, or The Whale, is working on a centennial celebration of Wilfred Owen for the colossal video wall in the foyer. Any gallery that starts as it means to go on, like this, deserves every future success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d130bf3c3424235fe7e409bc97c032eeb2379b9/0_312_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08a655f621f45fe6e183ba7ca8bf706c","title":"martin parr butlins by the sea big picture","story":"An early Martin Parr picture of a crowded pool in Filey, North Yorkshire shows a spirit of social realismMartin Parr took this photograph in 1972, when shivering in crowded public baths was the archetypal experience of knock-kneed British seven-year-olds. At the time Parr, aged 20, was a student of photography at Manchester Poly. His real education, though, came from his paid holiday work as an official snapper at Butlin’s by the Sea in Filey, North Yorkshire. This picture, part of an exhibition of Parr’s early work opening next week, was taken in his first year on the job, as a “black and white walkie”. He graduated the following summer to the coveted status of “colour walkie”, able to take pictures at the HawaiianCaribbean beachcomber bar, where a tropical storm was conjured every half an hour.You could say that Parr’s mature style as a photographer followed from that promotion. The colour-saturated images of fast food and sunburnt flesh, with which he made his name in the 1980s with series such as The Last Resort, were still to come. And you could also say that the shift in Parr’s style mirrored a shift in British society. His holiday subjects became more singular, atomised those left behind by packaged fortnights to Greece and\u0026nbspSpain.This picture comes from just before that great migration, and looks recognisably in the spirit of the social realist photographers – Henri Cartier-Bresson, Bill Brandt – who had turned their affectionate lenses towards working families at play. In Parr’s photograph the swimmers – notably skinnier than those of today – appear to be all in it together. The only ision seems that between shallow and deep end.

Not only was there a consensus about what a good library\u0026nbspshould consist of, it was also quite easy to accumulate the necessary classics in good Renaissance translations.Four hundred years on, the idea of “well read” is both much harder to define (less of a consensus) and also more difficult to fulfil from the global cornucopia of\u0026nbspchoice.One thing is certain: it’s still to do with the unaccountable workings of personal taste. The book list I’d consider essential to any description of well read might not be the next person’s yet both such lists would be equally\u0026nbspvalid.I’d suggest that three kinds of reading define the well-read mind. First, I’d want to include the immortals from the classics of Greece and Rome: Homer, Plato, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Euripides, Virgil, Plutarch, Ovid, Juvenal and Sappho…Next, from the Anglo-American literary tradition, we can’t forget Shakespeare, Milton, Donne, Byron, Austen, Keats, Dickens, Twain, Thoreau, Dickinson, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, Eliot, Pound, Auden, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Spark, Beckett, Woolf… and certainly another score of contemporary greats, including Baldwin, Pinter, Morrison, Miller, Bellow and Naipaul.Finally, and this is where it gets contentious, there’s great writing in translation, from Proust, Freud,\u0026nbspFanon and Bulgakov to Grass,\u0026nbspMárquez, Kundera and Levi.I’ve only scratched the surface, but these would be indispensable to my definition of well read.If you’ve got a question for Book Clinic submit it below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d4a96894ee79d297f3f52bc69bc4b29c127617/0_1962_3774_2264/master/3774.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a130f63765420b024a00d63128bb73e","title":"michael chabon pops fatherhood piece parenting teenagers essays","story":"Michael Chabon is one of America’s best-loved writers, the author of nine novels, including The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier \u0026amp Clay (which won the Pulitzer prize), Wonder Boys, The Yiddish Policemen’s Union and Moonglow. In 2009, he published Manhood for Amateurs, a series of reflections on his early years as a father. Now, with Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces, 54-year-old Chabon has collected his essays about parenting four teenagers.A few years ago, Chabon’s wife, the novelist Ayelet Waldman, wrote a controversial essay for the New York Times in which she claimed to love her husband more than her children (and to be the only one of her married friends still having regular sex). Chabon’s meditations on fatherhood are less likely to offend – they’re generous, very Californian (Chabon lives in Berkeley) and full of warm, often humorous anecdotes.If Manhood for Amateurs was about taking on responsibility, Pops feels like it’s about letting go as your kids grow up.Eventually, one of the things you come up against as a parent is the limitation of your importance in your kids’ life. They go off and forge relationships and make families by choice, in one way or another. You recede and dwindle in importance. If you are parenting properly, you’re parenting yourself out of a job.In the introduction to Pops, you recall a long-ago conversation with an older author who told you that you had to choose between being a great novelist or a father.I realised I wasn’t interested in the question of balancing one’s art and one’s life as a parent. I’m not saying it isn’t a problem, but I was trying to consider a different question – what difference does it make in the end, either way? Either your books will be forgotten or even if you are remembered in 100 years, you won’t be around to enjoy it.You write about a discussion with your daughter in which you talk about how important it is to be a “freakozoid”. How do we encourage our children to embrace their own weirdnesses?My daughter went to fifth grade one day wearing a dress on top of jeans, a green rubber apron with blue frogs all over it and a Martha Washington bonnet that we’d bought on a family trip to Washington’s home at Mount Vernon. When your kid has an impulse like that you either say: “Go change your clothes, people are going to make fun of you, you look ridiculous” or you say: “See you this afternoon.” If you choose the latter option then you take a step in the direction of encouraging your kid’s freakozoid tendencies.You write about your children by name. Do you ask their permission? Do you worry about their right to private lives?Everything you write is drawn from the people you know. You can do all this sweating and agonising about whether it’s going to embarrass them or make them angry and often it just sails right over them and they don’t even recognise that you’re talking about them.What’s the last really great book you read?I just reread for probably the fifth time The Queen’s Gambit by Walter Tevis. I had to teach it at the State University of New York. Every time I read it I’m overcome afresh with admiration for it and with awe for the control of its performance.How do you organise your books?Alphabetically, in the most part. We have a house where we live here in Berkeley and we have a summer house in Maine, which is full of all the books we couldn’t fit in here. There are some glassed-in shelves in our house in Maine in which, one summer’s day a few years back when I didn’t have a whole lot else to do, I organised them by colour. That looks pretty spectacular.Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time?I’m not sure if it quite counts as a classic, but I just read Sebald’s Austerlitz for the first time. I loved it – it’s beautiful. It was the one of his that I hadn’t read.Which book would you give to a young person?Books that I loved as a child and which I then reread to my children who also loved them were The Dark Is Rising series of novels. They are so fantastic. Also Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, based on Welsh mythology and The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster.Finally, there’s Harriet the Spy by Louise Fitzhugh, which I mostly loved because she wanted to be a writer when she grew up.What books do you read for sheer pleasure?I go back to Edgar Allan Poe, Raymond Chandler. There’s a little-known American thriller novelist called Ross Thomas. I’ll pick one of his books up and I’ll only sometimes have to read a chapter or two to re-establish contact with whatever it was that was comforting and familiar about it• Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces by Michael Chabon is published by Fourth Estate (£10).

The referendum, as the pollsters remind us, was a cultural phenomenon linked more closely to people’s attitudes to immigration and sovereignty than to economic success – a situation that persists today. Still, it would be satisfying to rewind and show that the reason many now believe Britain must stay connected to the EU for five years or so relates to complex customs rules and how they cannot be reconciled with open borders.Parliament only took notice when MPs on the Brexit select committee damned the government’s dithering. The committee’s message was that keeping the Irish border open and at the same time installing border controls with the EU couldn’t work.Ever since their report last December, the border contradiction has travelled through Whitehall like a virus, forcing civil servants to drop what they are doing in a desperate bid to find a cure. As one senior civil servant put it, officials are too busy finding a way to put the right export stamp on a sheep’s backside to think about anything else.That Britain has fallen off the investment agenda of most major businesses is a sad and irrefutable fact. It’s true some domestic businesses have found extra cash for investment: after all, Britain is a nation of almost 65 million people with 32 million of them in employment. It’s a big market.But the economic data remains weak and most of the spending is simply to keep abreast of digital developments. In other words, IT investments are being made just to stay in the game. Productivity has risen a little, but mainly as a result of a fall in hours worked to achieve the same outputs, rather than an increase in output from the same number of hours worked.Even the most confident Brexiters have noticed the economy flagging under the weight of the customs union uncertainty.It’s such a quandary that last week Tory MPs were openly considering adding another three years to the transition deal just to give the brightest minds in the civil service enough time to sort it out. That would take the UK’s membership of the customs union to 2023.They recognise that any attempt to stay inside an economic zone with the EU – whether that be the “Norway option”, under the banner of the European Economic Area, or the “Swiss option”, which involves negotiating upwards of 100 separate trade agreements – comes with a demand for free movement of labour. That, as we know, is an unacceptable outcome for Leave voters.These Tory MPs support Theresa May’s attempts to cobble together a technological solution and recognise that, from a standing start, it may take until 2023 to finish the job.However, that amounts to five more years of uncertainty and five more years of being a rule-taker from Brussels without the ability to strike fresh trade deals.But Johnson and Hannan are not anti-immigration. They would allow free movement of labour as the price of economic security, though they both seek the have-cake-and-eat-it option of signing separate trade deals. This places them at odds with Tories facing Ukip-sympathising constituents, who put immigration at the top of their list of concerns. Most importantly, it puts them at odds with Jacob Rees-Mogg.With the government’s supporters split several ways, it is difficult to see how an agreement can be struck that takes us past 2020. One faction or the other would need to retreat from their central demands.For this reason, most large businesses have prepared for an immediate exit from the EU next year and the single market and customs union in 2020. It’s a sensible plan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e45d518ca0ffd53e31e36ebc66c989386ce1f67/1092_514_3591_2154/master/3591.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ce1edb33ae5584073159fbe6d8aaab","title":"turn 40 what learned hadley freeman","story":"Here’s what I’ve learned“I’m gonna be 40! Someday!” Sally sobs in When Harry Met Sally. I have long considered Sally to be my cinematic alter ego so I think of this upcoming week as Sally Albright’s Midlife Crisis, because this Tuesday I turn 40. Not someday any more – now.I’m like Sally in pretty much every regard, from the fussy eating to the dislike of wagon wheel coffee tables, but on this subject we differ. I’m genuinely excited about my 40s. My teens were a mess of hormones and mental health issues. My 20s were lost in a vortex of terrible boyfriends and worse drugs. My 30s were a dream, and by “dream” I mean one of those anxiety dreams that turns your bed into a river of sweat, as I was hit by personality-altering fertility panics. My 40s are the decade when I can just live, unencumbered by the neuroses that, in my case, were largely just a symptom of being young and insecure. As Danny Glover would say, I’m\u0026nbsptoo old for that shit.Being 40 means I know stuff. More than when I was 30, and even more than when I was 20. I like that. I’ve spent four decades getting pretty much everything wrong, and now that I know the below I\u0026nbspreckon I should get everything right in the next four.1 As you age you gain so much more than you loseI am not one of those women whose looks improve with age. My cousin recently posted a photo of us in our 20s and I spent three solid days staring at it, not even breaking for meals. “Look how much prettier I once was!” I shouted at passers-by. “Those bright eyes! That unlined forehead! And I had no idea!” Sure, I could weep for all the boys I could have kissed back then but felt too ugly to do so, but those boys were never really all that. And I’m glad I never thought of my looks as my USP, because it means my sense of self is not bound up in them. Instead, I’ve got better at the things that matter to me. I’m more self-confident, which has made me a more stable person and better writer. I no longer judge myself by how others see me, or put up with men patronising me because I am femalehave a funny namewould choose the works of Steve Guttenberg as my Mastermind subject. In\u0026nbspshort, I don’t assume everyone else knows better than me, because experience has taught me I invariably know better than the men who patronise me. And that is worth the wrinkled forehead.Yes, it’s harder to get pregnant over 40 than it is under 30, and yes, women should know this. But the way we are obsessively harangued about this is a trick to make us turn off our intelligence and become baby-obsessed just as our male colleagues are making career strides. When I hit my mid-30s I started, quite frankly, to go mad. I\u0026nbspdated men who in normal circumstances I wouldn’t have spat on if they were on fire and I stayed with them in the belief they were “my last chance” (they weren’t). One night one of these idiots dumped me and, crazed with self-loathing, I went to a party thrown by one of my bosses, where I\u0026nbsppromptly got wrecked, was caught taking drugs in the loo by said boss and then insisted everyone watch me dance to Chaka Khan. Are\u0026nbspthese the actions of a sane person? They are not. So be aware of your options, but don’t become obsessed by them and don’t feel powerless before them. Most of all, don’t do drugs at your boss’s party. Learn from your elders!3 Don’t hide behind your youthI started writing for this paper when I was 20 – yes, as in half a lifetime ago – and because I spent so long working with people older than me I got a little too used to thinking of myself as that stock figure, The Comedy Chaotic Young Person. This meant that I often coasted (of course I came to work hungover – I’m basically a child!), underestimated myself (I can’t possibly write a serious article, I’m basically a child!) and thought my novelty value lay in my youth (Me! Basically a child!). I am definitely a grown-ass woman now so I can’t hide behind the smokescreen of youth and inexperience any more. Instead, I take personal responsibility for what I say and do. This, I honestly believe, is good for the soul.4 Finally, do everythingWell, not everything (see point 2). But the only real regrets I have about my youth are the things I didn’t do because of self-doubt: the jobs abroad I didn’t take, the books I didn’t write. Do it all now, young women, not because you won’t have time when you’re older (although you won’t), but because you shouldn’t let self-doubt hold you back from anything, and it holds too many of us back from everything. And\u0026nbspif there’s one thing I wish for my birthday, it’s that this no longer be true of the next generation. Happy birthday to all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de0e67359edb7dccac3a1390ef5be8695dbe9a4b/67_188_3337_2002/master/3337.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50344920fb6e646851506f8b2726fd8a","title":"silver birch academy trusts spending in spotlight","story":"A trust that runs four primary schools spent thousands of pounds on overseas trips for its leaders, more than £1,000 on two hotel rooms for two nights and almost £10,000 on Facebook adverts for a free school that has not yet been set up, according to allegations in a draft investigation seen by the Observer.In a case that will raise further questions about the financial management of academies, an inquiry into Silver Birch Academy Trust claims it spent £6,117 on a fact-finding trip to China and New Zealand for its chief executive Patricia Davies, a former headteacher of the year, and her deputy. The draft investigation states that the trust allegedly spent £99,000 refurbishing a former caretaker’s house, later to be rented out to a member of staff. It claimed £10,000 of work had been done without quotes having been obtained, while no rent had been paid.It alleges the trust spent £3.26m on services from six companies without providing evidence of any contracts having been signed. It also alleges that the trust had contracts with four consultancy companies, together worth £326,044, without the work having gone out to tender. Meanwhile, a school within the trust spent £1,064 on two rooms for two nights at the Hyatt Regency hotel, Birmingham, with £507 of this for a room where the guest did not turn up.The report seen by the Observer was a draft version. A final version has not yet been published and could differ from the draft.Silver Birch, which runs four primary school academies educating nearly 2,000 pupils in the London boroughs of Waltham Forest and Redbridge, also allegedly spent nearly £5,000 on four laptops for management. The findings are contained in a draft investigation report by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, which oversees academies. It is the second time in four years that the trust’s spending has been examined.“Neither could explain the in-year deficit that the trust incurred and did not show any understanding of what an in-year deficit was.”The findings come after the Commons public accounts committee concluded that “too often academy trusts are falling short” of the “highest standards of governance, accountability and financial management” and that the Department for Education is often “too slow to react”. The draft report highlights 11 alleged breaches of the Academies Financial Handbook, a government document setting out spending rules for academies. Several “novel or contentious payments” should have been sent to the ESFA for approval in advance, the report suggests.A spokeswoman for the trust said the overseas fact-finding mission had been “approved”. She said it had been part-funded by a group called the National Leaders of Education, which contributed £6,000 to the trip’s cost of £12,117. The remaining £6,117 came from the schools’ budget.In relation to the other allegations, she said: “As part of its recent review ESFA raised an inquiry in relation to the manner in which certain payments were made, evidenced or demonstrated value. Further information and evidence by way of clarification has already been provided to the ESFA. The payments referred to were made in accordance with trust policies and procedures. “Changes already under way and further measures introduced in response to the ESFA enquiries have dealt with many of the points raised. A final report has not as yet been published.”The Education Department said it did not comment on leaked documents, but added: “The department investigates all allegations of financial impropriety.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a310e813be9479ebcb7e830ee78c474f6a98d526/0_123_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36d0d4aa74b34bacb0f4627e659755d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A nesting stork, a rescued bobcat, and flamingos at sunset are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c82950b5ea7786da6119c059f233c02c77625420/0_94_3593_2155/master/3593.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d84a9653de24bed28cfd49fa0f9e9aa1","title":"jean luc godard cannes 2018 iphone facetime the image book","story":"Notoriously media-shy film-maker surprises press at film festival by answering questions on Russia and the future of cinema by iPhoneJean-Luc Godard, the famed figurehead of 1960s New Wave cinema, conducted one of the more unusual press conferences seen at the Cannes film festival by answering questions via FaceTime.The 87-year old French-Swiss director, best known for films such as Pierrot le Fou and Week End, was widely expected to skip the scheduled press conference, held for his latest video essay The Image Book, after having missed the Cannes red carpet premiere for the film the day before. Yet shortly before the start of the press conference it was announced that Godard would be appearing after all, albeit on an iPhone held up by his cinematographer Fabrice Aragno. “It’s a bit like machine gun fire,” he quipped as journalists stepped up to a microphone to ask him questions.It is not the first time that Godard has taken an idiosyncratic approach to press duties. At a Cannes press conference for his 2005 film Notre Musique the director invited a representative from the French actors and technicians’ union to speak in his stead. Godard sat silently while the representative listed detailed complaints against the French government.Godard is considered a major figure at Cannes, despite having an antagonistic relationship with the festival. The director played a major role in the cancellation of the 1968 edition of the festival, which he proposed in solidarity with the protests taking place across France at the time. His exalted status at Cannes is evidenced by the poster for this year’s festival, which features an image from Pierrot le Fou.A mediation on the nature of images and the West’s relationship with the Arab world, The Image Book is a fragmentary series of images taken from a variety of sources, including 1950s and 60s cinema and Isis recruitment videos. The film has been received warmly by critics, with the ’s Peter Bradshaw praising its “unexpected urgency and visceral strangeness”.Among the topics touched on by Godard during his unorthodox press conference were Russia, which he suggested “we have to be kind” to, and his fears for the future of cinema. “In the next 10 years, we think in a very few movie theatres, which are quite avant-garde, they will screen my films and films in general,” he said. The film-maker was more optimistic about the future of his own career however. “Absolutely,” he said when asked whether he was planning on making another film. “It doesn’t depend on me. It depends on my legs, it depends a lot on my hands, and it depends a little bit on my eyes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b550b6832504b538936dbef73fce3e342e4ac7e/707_133_4031_2418/master/4031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b69b85212d389eb695b3865dcdc4628","title":"johan cruyff leftwing legacy amsterdam rich barred renting childhood home","story":"Footballer’s flat in Amsterdam available as social housing for low earners only despite calls to turn property into a museumUntil he was 12, Johan Cruyff lived on the corner of Tuinbouwstraat and Akkerstraat in the working-class Betondorp district of Amsterdam. As well as being a wonderfully creative footballer, who during the mid-1970s became the best in the world, Cruyff was also famously leftwing. He said he could never have played for Real Madrid, because it was the club of General Franco, and became a strong supporter of Catalan independence during his years with Barcelona.Cruyff died two years ago, at the age of 68, but in Betondorp the legacy of his progressive politics lives on. His childhood home at 32 Akkerstraat has recently become available to rent, but there is a strict condition: only those with a household income of less than £36,000 should apply. With its historical associations, the two-bedroom flat would be worth a great deal on the open market, but that is not the way Cruyff would have wanted to play it. Owned by a social housing association, number 32 could be yours for £530 a month.It was on the pavement outside number 32, close to Ajax’s old De Meer stadium, where Cruyff first kicked a ball in earnest. He regularly returned to the area and his institute built a sports facilities nearby, known as the Cruyff courts. But attempts in the past to turn the apartment into a museum dedicated to him and his career, both as a footballer and manager, are believed to have been rejected by the man himself. The housing association says Cruyff’s childhood home features a “nice ground floor with a large garden” and spacious living room suitable for two to three people.The new residents will have to be big Cruyff fans though. Two of the apartment’s four large windows looking on to the street are covered with a dedication to the footballer, including a typically forthright quotation: “When I was young, to play outside was really normal. We wouldn’t think about it. Today kids are playing more with their mobile phones or sitting behind their computers. Because of this, more kids are suffering from obesity and the solution should be very simple. We have to teach children how to move more at school. With just a few alterations we could create for Dutch schoolyards more opportunities for children to play outside together. This can only happen if we do it together.”The flat’s windows are particularly large as the property once doubled up as the family greengrocery business until Cruyff’s father, Hermanus Cornelis Cruyff, died in 1958 of a heart attack, aged 45. Cruyff – a three-time winner of the Ballon d’Or, given to Europe’s best player – later said that his life up to 45 was beset by anxiety that he too would die young. His mother later moved a few blocks away and became a cleaner at Ajax, where her son was already becoming a star player in the youth teams.Students have lived rent-free in the property for the last five years, on condition that they helped in the community.Martin Schill, 71, who has lived opposite the flat for 15 years, said: “The students moved out last week. Before that it was a couple in their mid-60s who had lived there for 30 years. But they got a bit fed up with the constant interest, international interest too at times, so they moved.“A tour guide comes by here, and there is a Johan Cruyff run every year on his birthday from the Olympic stadium to Ajax’s stadium, which passes by the house.”Cruyff, who smoked heavily as a player – even lighting up at half-time – died in March 2016 from lung cancer. He only quit the habit in 1991 after undergoing heart surgery. On the footballer’s death, the Dutch king Willem-Alexander said the Netherlands had lost an icon.Schill said: “There were a thousand people at least out here when he died and it was covered with flowers. I am proud of living here. I like the attention that he gets. Cruyff deserves it and I do think it should be a museum. Apparently that has been raised again, but Cruyff’s wife doesn’t like all the fuss and attention, so it is being rented out.”A sports historian, Jurryt van de Vooren, said it was typical of the man that there was now debate about how to commemorate him. “People debated his football, his management and now his legacy. There has always been something going on with Cruyff,” he said.Ajax’s stadium, Amsterdam Arena, will officially be renamed the Johan Cruyff Arena next season. A square near the Olympic stadium will also no longer be called Stadionplein, but JohanCruijffplein instead.“The renaming of the stadium wasn’t really controversial but it means that it can’t have a commercial sponsor. Some wanted to be able\u0026nbspto sell the name,” Van de Vooren said. “The renaming of Stadionplein has upset people because no one was\u0026nbspasked about it. People are discovering the name of the area that\u0026nbspthey live in has suddenly changed.”A petition attracting thousands of signatures has endorsed the need for a tribute to Cruyff, but is demanding that Stadionplein retains its name. “Anything to do with Cruyff is complicated,” said Van de Vooren."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc96085f4bb7f3a0da649a30a0ce27c315a07d63/0_33_1455_873/master/1455.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e1f33a342059b5d0450df3f41fe3f9","title":"premier league farewells final day rooney toure crouch shaqiri","story":"It is the end of the Premier League season and inevitably it will be goodbye from some of the game’s big names, whether or not they realise it just yet. Not everyone gets to know when the curtain will fall on a top-flight career some have everything planned, others are overtaken by events, while a few will rage against the dying of the light by seeking new contracts elsewhere. But when the 27th edition of the Premier League commences in August it is likely one or two familiar faces will be missing. Here are some of the high-profile performers whose Match of the Day days are in danger of drawing to a close – or already have done. whose Match of the Day days are in danger of drawing to a close – or already have done.Definitely leaving Manchester City at the moment and hopeful of signing a short contract with another Premier League club in order to see out the last two years of his career in England. Two years is the 34-year-old’s own estimate and he is even advertising the fact that he will be fresh for next season as Ivory Coast will not be competing at the World Cup. Found it difficult to get a look-in with City this season, though not every up-and-coming Premier League side are as well stocked with bright young talent as Pep Guardiola’s City. There is no doubt Touré did the job he was brought in to do in his eight years in Manchester – the club wanted a Champions League winner in their midst to add gravitas and experience to their ambition – and he might yet be picked up by a team looking to boost their Premier League credibility.Is only halfway through a two-year contract at his boyhood club, but the return to Merseyside has perhaps not gone as well as expected – what exactly was expected? – and one last move to MLS looks increasingly likely. Rooney could have done that a year ago, but when the opportunity to rejoin Everton presented itself he found it impossible to resist. No one can blame him for that, but Everton have changed managers since, and neither Ronald Koeman nor Sam Allardyce found it particularly easy to identify a role for the former Manchester United player. At 32 he should have a couple of years left, though pace is everything in the Premier League and the lesson seems to be that if you are no longer quick enough to play up front you will not necessarily find it any easier to move back to midfield.With a release clause of £12m and a considerable amount of talent, Stoke’s Swiss winger is already attracting attention from a number of Premier League clubs, so this might not be a permanent loss. He could disappear abroad, however. He has already played for Bayern Munich and Inter, so this is the time to acknowledge one of the best left feet in the business. Not everyone’s idea of a team player but at his best he is brilliant to watch and at 26 he still has the potential to shine if a leading side can offer him a regular place.Contracted to Stoke until 2019, by which time he will be 38, the well-travelled striker confessed after the Potters were relegated that he did not know what the future held. Because of his age it is hard to see another Premier League destination for one of England’s most easily recognised players, yet he proved surprisingly resilient for Stoke, where he kept coming up with the goals despite advancing years. Crouch is now being linked with Rangers, though so is almost anyone Steven Gerrard has ever played alongside. If Crouch does leave the Premier League, he does so with a proud record of 169 goals and the most headed goals in the competition’s history.Not quite a household name after a single season at Stamford Bridge, though with even Cesc Fàbregas pointing out that Chelsea have not been scoring enough goals it seems the club’s search for an effective replacement for Diego Costa will begin again. The £58m Morata is being linked with Juventus, partly because he played in Turin before joining Real Madrid and partly because he has not exactly embraced English football with both arms, despite scoring 15 goals. Antonio Conte has frequently selected Morata on the bench, but even as an impact substitute he now finds himself in the shadow of Olivier Giroud.Hanging up his boots at Manchester United to join the coaching staff, and according to José Mourinho the only player who will need replacing this summer. A reliable midfielder with over 650 Premier League appearances for West Ham, Tottenham and United, Carrick is also the only English player besides Wayne Rooney to achieve all six of the honours possible in club football. Despite Mourinho’s flattering comments about the hole he will leave in the side the 36-year-old has been used extremely sparingly this season, his defensive duties having been largely taken over by Nemanja Matic. Carrick was a midfielder of similar discipline, willing to stay back and protect the back four, and if anything his distribution and ball retention were superior."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23557024a3cd88a4c6d0d71f3d9427a8a288aa8a/0_64_3215_1928/master/3215.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=935fb99aabc880eb91e7f3ce15296e8f","title":"tranmere boreham wood national league final match report","story":"After three seasons enduring the myriad degradations of life as one of the bigger clubs marooned outside the Football League, Tranmere Rovers earned a return to the fourth tier after a National League promotion play-off final that was mired in controversy from its opening minute.Despite going a man down to a red card after less than 60 seconds, Tranmere’s players dug deep enough to prevail.Having lost another of their men to an injury caused by a bottle thrown from the Boreham Wood end, they have every right to be pleased. Determined not to suffer consecutive heartbreaks after last year’s Wembley defeat at the hands of Forest Green, ultimately they proved far too streetwise than comparative minnows who were almost certainly punching above their weight. A Football League side in all but status until the final whistle, their return to the fold is overdue.“You’d have to be involved inside the football club to see how desperately we needed this,” said their manager, Micky Mellon. “We’ve suffered, people have lost their jobs and to get the club back into the league is an unbelievably proud moment for me.”Tranmere made a catastrophic start, losing Liam Ridehalgh inside a minute after the defender was shown a red card for a shin-high, studs-up challenge that sent the Boreham Wood midfielder Ricky Shakes flying. While referees are generally pre-disposed towards extreme leniency in the opening minutes of match, Ridehalgh could have few grumbles about Neil Hair’s bold call and walked without fuss.“He’s been a bit reckless,” said Mellon. “Maybe he got a bit caught up in the occasion.”While Mellon pondered his reshuffle, his team went in front the excellent Andy Cook rising above two markers to head home a James Norwood cross after seven minutes. As Cook and his team-mates celebrated the striker’s 28th goal of the season, Josh Ginnelly was left looking dazed after being hit by a bottle thrown by a Boreham Wood supporter.Mellon subsequently took off midfielder Larnell Cole to fill the Ridehalgh-shaped hole in his back four and with Ginnelly still struggling a little under half an hour later he was replaced by Connor Jennings.“He was injured, but it was also a tactical move,” said Mellon. “Connor’s been out there before, helping his full-back, stopping crosses and that’s not really Josh’s game. He did get hit with a bottle or something from the crowd. That’s disappointing, but look, it’s an exciting day and somebody’s got a wee bit carried away.”Despite their numerical advantage, Boreham Wood never really found their rhythm in a first half dominated by Tranmere. A club whose average attendance rarely rises above 700, their moments of quality were rare and they were perhaps overawed. What should have been the most simple of passes went astray with monotonous frequency.Deep into eight minutes of added time at the end of a first half when Tranmere were forced to use their final substitution after losing Sutton to a calf injury, Boreham Wood restored parity when Bruno Andrade scored his fourth goal in consecutive matches against Tranmere. With supporters from the north-west whistling anxiously for the interval, the 24-year-old seized on a pull-back from the left to calmly slot the ball through the legs of Manny Monthe, past the outstretched arm of Scott Davies and into the bottom corner.A man down and with no fresh legs available from the bench, Tranmere were one injury away from calamity and it was unsurprising to see them spend more time on the back foot as the game went on. Mellon could be seen exhorting his team’s supporters from his technical area and they responded by ramping the volume up to a Spinal Tap-esque 11. Norwood had a good opportunity to restore Tranmere’s lead soon afterwards, but despite stretching every sinew he was unable to poke a deflected Jennings shot home.Boreham Wood must have fancied their chances as the game went on with Tranmere’s players looking dead on their feet. They perhaps should have taken the lead when Shakes stole in at the far post only to steer a header wide.Seconds later, Norwood converted a Jennings cross from the right. The Boreham Wood goalkeeper, Grant Smith, got a strong hand to the ball, but could not keep it out. “It was slow, wasn’t it,” said Norwood. “I thought it would never go over that line.”Having restored Tranmere to a status more befitting a club of their size, Mellon was looking forward to the journey home. “I’m going to get on the bus and I will enjoy the trip home,” he said. “Where the night takes me after that, I can’t really tell you because the Glaswegian in me will no doubt climb out at some stage. I don’t care about that, because that’s what it’s all about. You’ve got to enjoy these moments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c01d4e908f3aef41eb68cede3b77858736954fe3/166_1251_9377_5625/master/9377.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d18c5d2496494d59b595723be85da0cc","title":"arsene wenger arsenal arseblog","story":"As the Arsenal manager takes his leave, writers for Arseblog tell a fellow Gooner what it feels like to lose such a key part of their lives after 22 yearsby  Donald McRae. Montage by David McCoy ImagingArsène Wenger’s head fell off and rolled across the glass table before plunging on to my living room floor. Last week, an hour after Arsenal had lost to Atlético Madrid, to ruin the fleeting dream of Wenger’s final match as manager being in the Europa League final, I had lifted up the old bobble-head and prepared to move it back to the window sill.Wenger was placed on the glass table in front of the television and Arsenal were rejuvenated. We beat Bayern 2-0 in Munich, only to suffer a familiar Champions League exit on away goals. But the mysterious force of the bobble-head had to be relied upon from that night as one Arsenal pattern – defeat in the last 16 – was replaced by another, in the habitual struggle to make the top four. With mini-Arsène in place, Arsenal went on an unbeaten 10-game run to steal fourth spot from Spurs by a point.Over the last two seasons of Wenger’s 22 years as manager, as the top-four tradition slid away, the world ided Arsenal’s fans into Wenger Out or Wenger In camps. It was hardly more subtle in our house. Should mini-Arsène watch the next game or did he deserve to be consigned to the window sill in his long zippered coat?Since Wenger announced his decision on 20 April to leave the club on Sunday, he has been on the glass table for every game. Yet the bobbled Arsène could not spook Diego Costa or Diego Simeone as Arsenal lost their last meaningful match under Wenger. The roll of his head, as I picked him up, felt symbolic.Andrew Allen, another Arsenal fan, endured a more testing ordeal that night. As deputy news editor at Arseblog, the celebrated Arsenal fan website which its founder and chief writer, Andrew Mangan, began in 2002, Allen was bereft of words as he tried to start his post-match analysis. “It’s very rare I get the responsibility to write the main blog,” Allen says, “and I knew if we won it’s easier to write. But, after we lost, I sat in front of the laptop for an hour trying to find an introductory paragraph. I couldn’t do it. Eventually I began jotting down moments from all these years under Arsène. It spiralled out of control and at three in the morning I was still there, down a YouTube rabbit hole, with the occasional tear and glass of wine. It poured out.”The next morning I still felt sad that Wenger’s last game in charge will be today, away to Huddersfield, rather than at home in France, in Lyon, against an old enemy, Marseille, in a European final he longed to win. But, turning to my usual read of Arseblog, there was no match report. Instead, the headline read: “No European Trophy. No Happy Ending. But…”Allen then listed 197 moments and memories, mishaps and milestones, stretching from “Three League titles. Thierry Henry. Giroud’s scorpion kick. Chu-Young Park. Paris in the pouring rain. Santi’s dancing feet. It’s Thierry Henry, he’s scored, he’s scored for Arsenal in the Bernabéu! Wright breaking Bastin’s record. Cesc’s mullet. Sol on a free. Abou’s ankles. Broccoli” to “Blackcurrant shirts. Giroud’s abs. It’s only Ray Parlour. Henry looping it over Barthez. Pizzagate. Pires … it was in from the moment he hit it! Santi’s cup final free-kick. Together. The Invincibles. 22 years. Thanks for the memories, boss. Thank you so much.”He has equally evocative memories of that sun-kissed afternoon at the Emirates as, after a 5-0 demolition of Burnley, Wenger felt the Arsenal love again. “It was very emotional,” Allen says. “I sit next to my mum and dad and all three of us didn’t look at each other when Wenger spoke. I didn’t want my mum to see me tearing up and I don’t think she wanted me to see her tearing up. His name was sung with passion and it was a kind of joy. It took me over the edge.”Mangan, who lives in Dublin, flew in for the game. As the voice of Arseblog, he has probably written more words about Wenger than anyone else since 2002. “I won’t ever write as many words about another inidual,” he says. “Arsène has been a constant in my life for 16 years – and the six years before I started the website.“For a long time Arsenal fans have been ided into unnecessary camps of Wenger In or Out. But the vast majority have a far more nuanced view of the last 22 years. So being there, listening to the fans sing with one voice about Arsène, felt cathartic. It felt healing.“Of course it’s not the same as a European final in Lyon – and that’s why I was devastated last week. We all thought: ‘Please, please, let him win a European trophy.’ Of course I’m going to Lyon anyway. I have tickets, the hotel is booked. It was a choice between Arsène Wenger and Diego Costa. Diego won.”Allen sighs when asked who he might support in the final. “I don’t know. Me and my friends just might take a big Arsène banner.”Wenger has described his career at Arsenal as “a love affair”. Mangan hesitates when considering the phrase as a fan and writer who has examined Wenger’s attributes and failings so closely. “A love affair is too passionate for me. That stems from the frustration of the last years. It’s a relationship built on love and respect for a guy who came in when nobody knew him. He proved himself as a great manager and a great man. He was successful and he changed English football – and the perception of foreign managers and players. He was so brilliant there was always a yearning for him to replicate that in later years and it didn’t quite happen. I wanted Arsenal to win under Arsène – because of this respect, admiration and pride when you heard him talk about Arsenal, football and society.“Of course he’s an obsessive. On his birthday they asked him what was he going to do and he said: ‘I’ll watch a second ision German game.’ The journalist urged him to celebrate his birthday. Wenger said: ‘I’ll put some candles on the top of my TV if that makes you happy.’ Arsène’s real passion was always football. That’s probably not too healthy but it’s a fundamental part of why he was in this job so long.”The Arseblog writers offer an often painful insight into Wenger’s failings. “In some ways his biggest fallibility was his willingness to be a force field who ensured all criticism centred upon him,” Allen suggests. “His refusal to throw players under the bus was beautiful but sometimes the players needed to be called out. Some of the signings were very odd – remember André Santos – but you never knew whether Wenger had more money to spend.”How did Allen do in his exam? “I was studying Russian history at UCL, which is slightly niche. But I scraped through. Then, at the start of 2004-05 season, after we’d won the league and gone unbeaten, the first seven games were fantastic. I remember playing Middlesborough on another glorious summer day and my brother and I said: ‘How many will we score today?’ You know it can’t go on like this for much longer – but you never want to look that far down the line.”Amid the poignance of Wenger’s leaving there is the thrilling uncertainty of a new era. “I definitely have feelings of excitement around a new manager,” Mangan stresses. “What’s going to happen now? Who is it going to be? What kind of football does he like? What kind of a man is he? Who will he sign? How many of Arsenal’s values will be upheld? It would be awful to get a manager like Mourinho with no interest in young players. Maybe that’s just us being romantic Arsenal fans. Maybe we need to be more pragmatic.”Mangan and Allen would choose Massimiliano Allegri, the Juventus manager, to replace Wenger. “I like the idea of Allegri,” Mangan says. “He’s more defensively minded than Wenger. With our attack a manager who focuses on the defensive side, with the right organisation and personnel, could make everything gel. It’s hard to imagine, when you’ve got Mkhitaryan, Lacazette, Aubameyang, Özil and Ramsey, a new manager will do what Jack Charlton did to John Aldridge – and make them defend from the front and inhibit their attacking quality.“After 22 years there is excitement about something fresh and new. Even the uncertainty is interesting. We don’t know what the new guy is going to do or how he’s going to do it. We don’t know how it will work with the director of football, head of recruitment and chief executive all taking a prominent role. It’s a brave new world.”An Allegri-shaped world? “It’s just a gut feeling but they might go with somebody younger and less experienced,” Mangan says. “The power dynamic has been so weighted in favour of the manager they might go another way. If it’s Allegri or Luis Enrique they will have to defer to them. My gut says they might go for Mikel Arteta or Patrick Vieira.”Our Wenger bobble-head will be moved back to its final resting place, in my office. I like the idea of a mini-Max Allegri on the glass table but Allen also suspects it could be a different name. “I’m open to something left-field,” he says. “But every two or three years we’ll probably be changing our manager and that will be really hard to get used to. After Arsène, we’re in the madhouse with everyone else now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7b8162e4ca2022af8e5511f7ecda60c511945f7/8_0_4274_2564/master/4274.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d0fd551a39576c92648d4df3ed00fbf","title":"hamburg historic relegation bundesliga","story":"A 2-1 home victory against Mönchengladbach was in vain for the Bundesliga’s only ever-present club thanks to Wolfsburg’s win, and fireworks and flares rained down at the endThe city of Hamburg has seen significant regeneration in the last decade. In an effort to rid the city of its faintly sleazy reputation, as home of the Reeperbahn and the stag do delights it contains, a whole new district – HafenCity – was established with plans for modern shops, homes and entertainment venues. The most prominent of the latter was the Elbphilharmonie concert hall, an extraordinary structure that cost €789m, more than three times its initial budget.But as new buildings rise around town, the solid old pillars of their football club crumble. For the first time since the Bundesliga was established in 1963, Hamburger SV have been relegated to the second tier. Hamburg were the only side to stay in the ision for that whole time, earning them the nickname Der Dino: not even Bayern Munich, who came up in 1965, had boasted such a lengthy continuous run among the German elite. A clock at their Volksparkstadion home proudly displayed exactly how long they had been in the top flight: that will be reset.The club that nurtured Uwe Seeler, of Manny Kaltz and Rafa van der Vaart and Kevin Keegan, European champions in 1983 under Ernst Happel and a stalwart of German football, will play in Bundesliga II for the first time in their history. On Saturday they needed to beat Borussia Mönchengladbach and hope for a favour from already relegated Köln, who needed to beat Wolfsburg.However, the promise from Hamburg fans to send barrels of beer to Köln if they pulled it off didn’t quite work: Wolfsburg won 4-1, helped by a goal from the Liverpool loanee Divock Origi, rendering Hamburg’s 2-1 win over Mönchengladbach irrelevant. Wolfsburg aren’t yet safe: they face a play-off against Holstein Kiel, the third-placed team in Bundesliga II.In truth this has been coming. Hamburg stayed up on the final day last season (beating Wolfsburg to do so, as it happens), and survived in the relegation play-offs in both 2015 and 2016, on the latter occasion after a 91st-minute equaliser. “Economically speaking, Hamburg is the worst investment decision of my life,” Klaus-Michael Kühne, the businessman who has pumped millions into the club, said this month.This season has been even more chaotic than most. Three managers sat in the dugout: Markus Gisdol was sacked in January after winning only twice since August, Bernd Hollerbach lasted a winless two months, then the reserve coach Christian Titz was promoted for what looked like the last rites.Most expected Titz to simply prepare the side for the second tier, to perhaps take them down with a little dignity. Maybe he could give some young players a bit of first‑team experience. But in the end he presided over a near miracle. On 1 April they were bottom, seven points off the last safe spot, and a defeat to Hoffenheim a few weeks later left them eight points adrift with four games remaining. But he reinvigorated the team, winning four of their last six, including an extraordinary 3-1 victory over Wolfsburg that gave them late hope. The 13 points gained in Titz’s eight games in charge represent more than a third of the season’s total.Hamburg literally went out with a bang: in the last few minutes of the Mönchengladbach game fireworks and flares rained down from the stands, filling the stadium with smoke, either in frustration or protest from the fans. The last moments of Bundesliga football in Hamburg – for now, at least – saw the pitch filled with police and the goalmouth on fire.Hamburg are down, after nearly 55 years. Still, at least they have a nice place to watch opera."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39bed51595042251ff65e08bd336dd5ff9299f1a/0_129_3861_2317/master/3861.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42a9674b4e72c3490227cf9bc0074c97","title":"fabric swaps hedonism meditation mindfulness nightclub","story":"Fabric, in London’s Clerkenwell, is famous for its vibrating dance floor and late-night partying. But on Tuesday the nightclub will play host to an altogether different mind-bending experience.More than a thousand people are expected to gather at the venue, where pumping beats will by replaced by deafening silence for what is being billed as the biggest group meditation ever held in Britain.Self-styled meditation guru Will Williams is staging the event to launch his new book, The Effortless Mind. The aim, he says, is to attract a new generation to “the inner joys of meditation”.Fabric epitomises the “old hedonism”, he says – a drink-and-drugs-fuelled dance scene from which people traditionally stagger home at dawn. “I want to bring a new hedonism into its space. It’ll be a dynamic, energised night but we’ll all wake up the next morning feeling fantastic,” he says. So it will be mocktails, not cocktails, on the menu.Williams knows only too well the pain of the morning after the night before. A former booking agent for bands and musicians, he used to “indulge in every bit of debauchery you can think of”. But, a decade ago, his life changed after a friend persuaded him to try meditation. At first, he saw it as a means to conquer insomnia and a “brilliant cure for hangovers”. But he was soon hooked and moved to India to study with “the masters” for three years. Experimenting with different types of mindfulness, he kept coming back to vedic meditation. “It doesn’t involve chanting, religion, or uncomfortable sitting positions,” Williams says. “It’s easy, it’s cool, it works.”But he didn’t stop at his own personal enlightenment. Williams calculated that taking the art of ancient eastern meditation and turning it into a thriving western business was the lucrative way forward.He now runs meditation studios in two venues in central London (a three-day course costs around £300) and plans to expand across the country. Williams has no shortage of converts to what he describes as a path to “deeper fulfilment”. One of his newest is Take That’s Howard Donald. After two decades of dismissing “the whole joss-stick-burning thing” that other members of the group embraced, Donald says he now swears by it.“It’s helping me be more creative, but without the drugs,” Donald, who has just turned 50, said. “The thoughts and colours are amazing, the golds, the reds, the blues – I don’t know what they mean, but the visions you get in your mind, they’re beautiful.“The song ideas are flowing even when I’m in the middle of a meditation – sometimes, I just want to cut it short and get the dictaphone out,” he says.“You get emotional sometimes. But that’s good, it’s about letting stuff out, clearing your body, bit by bit.”While grateful that Donald is positive about his experiences, Williams is keen to distance himself from the meditation and celebrity love-in. He worries that it can inspire some, but make others cynical. “We need to show that wisdom, meaning, joy, purpose – it’s about you, me and everyone. We’re all going through the same emotional challenges, whoever we are,” he says.“Meditation is a vehicle, a drug if you like, and a really powerful one.”• To order Effortless Mind by Will Williams for £12.74, go to bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5356268d0933f18536c664abd0dfbeb019a680f6/0_139_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56cd793fa8358567cbca8b7592f4ac3e","title":"rachel cooke pineapple hawaiian pizza food snob authentic","story":"We might be a nation ided over the pros and cons of a Hawaiian pizza, but other toppings are also beyond the paleWhen I began thinking about this column, I hoped to take a deep, scholarly e into the realm of the Hawaiian pizza, the abominationdelicacy (delete as applicable) that, according to recent research by YouGov, now ides the nation more than any other foodstuff.But in the end, this proved to be impossible. No book I own has any advice at all on the matter of whether pineapple can ever make an acceptable topping for pizza nor have I been able to locate a definitive history of this controversial dish, said to have been invented by a Greek Canadian called Sam Panopoulos at his restaurant in Ontario some time in 1962. (He was “inspired”, I gather, by certain sweet and savoury Chinese dishes rather than by a malevolent belief that some people simply do not deserve the good things in life.)As a result, I cannot, on this occasion, play the neutral referee, for which reason I’m just going to let the bigotry pour out of me, like cheap prosecco into a large measure of Aperol.Why would you do that? Add chunks of pineapple to a pizza, I mean. I find it hard to think of anything worse – though according to the trade magazine Pizza Today, various radical experiments involving dates, other fruit and “salumi marmalade” are currently underway in the land of the pepperoni. These do indeed sound at least as bad as pineapple, a fruit that pulls off the rare feat of being at once both too tart and too sweet, and which overwhelms whatever happens to be in its path. (This includes, incidentally, some hangovers as a student, I used sometimes to keep a carton of pineapple juice on the window ledge of my college room expressly for the purpose of seeing off a particularly heinous kind of Guinness-induced headache.)Pineapple, which contains an enzyme that is used commercially as a meat tenderiser, and which eats away at the hands of cannery workers unless they wear gloves, is no friend of gentle mozzarella or delicate parma ham. It’s not a friend of anything really, unless you’re the director of a new production of Abigail’s Party and have a bunch of cocktail sticks to hand.It is a fruit that belongs only in 18th-century oil paintings in pina coladas (kitsch, but undeniably delicious) and on the top – or bottom – of a freshly baked upside-down cake. Put it on a pizza, and you’ve committed a crime against good taste. Plus, said pizza will soon be really soggy.Some will say all this is snobbery on my part, and perhaps it is, for I have to admit to Matilda’s Miss Trunchbull tendencies when it comes to pizza. The longer the menu, the less happy I am. I like my pizza to be minimalist, the culinary equivalent of a Mondrian, or even a Ben Nicholson when my friend, C, used to order that old Pizza Express number involving leeks and raisins, I always used to feel slightly funny, as if she’d been caught admiring a Beryl Cook or something (C is a brilliant and celebrated painter).You want oregano and garlic, the toppings that were stowed on board Neapolitan ships, the better that sailors could make pizza away from home (hence marinara) also, the mozzarella and fresh basil that were added later in honour of the visit of an Italian queen to Naples (margherita).But while olives, anchovies and cured meat are just about acceptable modern additions, I draw the line at fleshy hunks of tuna, mounds of grassy rocket and slug-like grilled aubergines. Ditto hard-boiled eggs. Chilli is good, but in its invisible form (cayenne), I think, rather than as oil-slicked peppers.I ate the best pizza of my life not on some Italian street corner, nor even in New York, but in Chelmsford, made for me by a friend’s Calabrian mother. It was pretty fiery, as was she: a woman I can no more picture with a tin of pineapple in her hands than I can a Chanel handbag or a delicate paper fan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e63cde662357a3d526b6159277f727493e2b69c4/62_553_1916_1149/master/1916.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82baf9f8753b7811764cead27c842053","title":"united airlines tomato juice planes","story":"United Airlines has reversed their plan to remove the beverage from flights after outrage from customersUnited Airlines know a thing or two about weaselly management-speak. Last year when a passenger was forcibly removed by police from an overbooked flight, bleeding and screaming, their spokesman initially called it as an “involuntary de-boarding situation”. CEO Oscar Munoz doubled down, referring to the removal as “re-accommodating the customers”.This week the airline announced they were “streamlining” their onboard menu items on flights under four hours – their way of saying customers would be getting less food and fewer options. Muffins would replace hot breakfasts, wraps would replace full lunches, and tomato juice as a beverage option would be phased out.Customers were quick to express their outrage, and today United U-turned on the tomato decision. So why is the beverage – which is not particularly popular under normal circumstances in America – drunk so much on planes?There have been a number of scientific investigations trying to answer that question. In 2015, Robin Dando, a physiologist at Cornell, found that exposure to loud noises, like that of a jet engine, dulls sweet flavours but intensifies the umami taste present in tomato juice. Five years earlier, German airline Lufthansa commissioned research into the popularity of tomato juice when they realised they were serving 53,000 gallons a year. Researchers from the Fraunhofer Society found people enjoyed it more on planes because our taste and smell receptors are less sensitive at altitude, which means people enjoy the freshness of the juice without the earthy, mulchy taste.Those research-based accounts seem somewhat contradictory, though: can the taste of the drink be both enhanced and dulled? Even if they can, do ordinary passengers know that before they order the drink?It’s more likely there is a psychological basis for the popularity. Choosing a drink on a flight is an unusual situation: you have to decide when the trolley comes to you whether you’re thirsty or not. The beverage is normally free – meaning you want to extract as much value as possible. Tomato juice hits an odd sweet spot: it’s the only drink on the trolly that feels healthy, extravagant and unusual – plus you’ve seen so many other people order it, it becomes a tradition, the same way you eat popcorn at the cinema or hotdogs at a baseball game.There might be another reason too, which goes back to United “streamlining” the food options. With less free food available on flights, many people are hungry when the drink cart comes around but don’t want to pay for a meal. Tomato juice has a lots of fibre and high water content, and makes you feel full even when you’re not. It’s basically a cold soup you could even call it a free meal.So congratulations to United for realising their huge screw-up and reinstating it. Or, as a United spokesman put it, in the company’s inimitable style: “With all of our food offerings, we monitor customer feedback and what they would prefer and adjust accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c9b6e19db208848681af123d3a0753bb7bc003/0_1241_3723_2232/master/3723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f34890aa172159dc366099ac5eb3ab","title":"yotam ottolenghi tamarind recipes","story":"This sweet and sour fruit lends great flavour to prawn stew, asparagus salad and glazed pork chopsThe sharp and sweet acidity of the tamarind fruit is a much-loved tool of Indian and Pakistani cooks, as well as other parts of Asia and the Middle East. But it has never become a key player in western larders, which is a shame, because it shouldn’t be restricted to one cuisine. I often interchange tamarind with vinegar or citrus, and it’s already familiar to Brits through Worcestershire and HP sauces, where it provides the familiar, sharp kick.This southern Iranian dish features fresh fenugreek, which can be found in Middle Eastern shops and online. The leaves add a more herbaceous dimension than the seeds, although the latter would work here, too. It’s important to cook the herbs, because that creates the deep flavour.

Strain into a sieve, pressing down on the pulp to extract as much liquid as you can: you should end up with about 160ml tamarind liquid.Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat, then sweat the onion for 10 minutes, until soft and lightly browned. Add the rest of the garlic and half the green chillies, and cook, stirring, for a minute. Add the spring onions, herbs and fenugreek, and cook on a medium-low heat for 20 minutes, stirring often, until deep green.Add the flour, spices, chilli flakes, a teaspoon and a half of salt and a generous grind of pepper, cook for 30 seconds, then add the tamarind liquid, sugar and 500ml water, and simmer for 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and comes together.Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on a high flame. Fry a third of the prawns for two minutes on each side, until golden brown, then move to a plate.Stir the remaining raw prawns into the sauce and cook for three minutes, until just cooked through.Serve the stew from the pan or a large bowl, sprinkled with coriander, the fried prawns and the remaining green chillies.This sharp, fresh mint sauce is a condiment for keeping in the fridge. I guarantee you’ll find yourself reaching out for it with increasing regularity: it’s great with lamb or pork, spooned over rice or mixed with vegetables.I prefer to extract tamarind paste from compressed pulp. Shop-bought pastes vary greatly in concentration of flavour and are generally sharper and more intense than paste you make yourself, so add it gradually, until you get a level of acidity you like.Prep 8 minCook 3 minMakes 1 small jar – about 180ml2 tsp shop-bought tamarind paste, or a lemon-sized piece of tamarind pulp 35g mint leaves15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped1 tbsp white-wine vinegar1 tbsp honey1 anchovy fillet, drained½ tsp ground cardamom½ tsp ground Iranian lime (optional)2 green chillies, deseeded and finely chopped1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tsp dijon mustardZest of 1 lime, finely grated2 tbsp olive oilSaltIf using, soak the tamarind pulp in 60ml lukewarm water for a few minutes, work with your hands until the pulp falls away from the seeds, then pass through a fine sieve to make a thick paste. It will keep in the fridge for up to a month.Blitz two teaspoons of shop-bought tamarind paste – or two to three teaspoons of the homemade paste – with the remaining ingredients, two tablespoons of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt: you should end up with a thick, green paste. Spoon into a clean jar and refrigerate for up to a week.This light, simple salad is perfect alongside a meat or veggie main. Counterintuitively, the sharp sauce complements the gentle flavour of the asparagus, rather than overpowering it. Gently mix the salad mere seconds before serving, to keep the thin asparagus slices as fresh as possible.Prep 5 minCook 10 minServes 4 as a side400g thick-stemmed asparagus, woody ends snapped off1½ tbsp olive oil1 tbsp lime juice15g mint leaves, roughly shredded30g pistachio, very lightly toasted and roughly choppedSalt2 tbsp mint, lime and tamarind sauce (see previous recipe)Using a peeler or mandoline, slice the asparagus lengthways into fine strips and mix in a bowl with a teaspoon and a half of oil, a teaspoon and a half of lime juice, half the mint leaves, half the pistachios and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.In a small bowl, stir the mint, lime and tamarind sauce with the remaining oil and lime juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.Just before serving, spoon the sauce over the asparagus, and sprinkle on the remaining mint and pistachios.Brining chops doesn’t only add flavour to the meat – it also makes them incredibly tender.

My picture editor at the Observer, Peter Crookston, knew I was in the US on my way to get married in Vancouver, and he sent me a telegram. ‘Get down to Birmingham, Alabama.’ So I did.”Photographer Colin Jones is casting his mind back 55 years, to a time when the slow pace of communications made journalism both simpler and more confusing. “I wasn’t sure what was happening in Alabama. I wasn’t sure what to expect. But I had my cameras with me.”Jones soon discovered he was flying into the cauldron of the civil rights movement just as it was boiling over. That April in 1963 Martin Luther King had written from the city’s jailhouse: “Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known.” This was why Birmingham had been selected for the next phase in the struggle for equality.It began with economic boycotts, sit-ins, marches and fruitless attempts to negotiate on the part of African Americans. The response came in the form of bombings, mass arrests, and police and Ku Klux Klan-led violence.Jones, who was 27 at the time, found the segregation shocking, he says: the ubiquitous “no blacks allowed” signs the extreme poverty of the African American neighbourhoods in contrast to the air-conditioned, whites-only department stores. “I didn’t think America was as bad as this. It was like South Africa during apartheid, which I’d seen.”Days before Jones arrived in Birmingham, the authorities had broken up a protest by schoolchildren with high-pressure fire hoses and attack dogs on the orders of the notorious public safety commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor. Jones’s images record the immediate aftermath – the wreckage of homes destroyed by rioting (with clean washing hanging among the rubble) released protesters emotionally sharing their grievances the recently bombed AG Gaston Motel (King had stayed there the home of his brother, AD King, was also bombed the same night) and opposing ranks of African American protesters and white law enforcement – which made for intrinsically dramatic compositions.Neither side objected to being photographed. The police were almost conceited, Jones says, proudly brandishing their weaponry. African Americans on the street (mostly men) often filled him in on what was going on and pointed him in the right direction. They even invited him into a meeting at the 16th Street Baptist Church, the headquarters of the campaign.The Birmingham campaign was not in vain. The media coverage and worldwide shock brought the civil rights issue to the attention of President John Kennedy. In June, he set in motion what came to be the 1964 Civil Rights Act, telling the nation: “The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.”That September, however, in one of the worst atrocities of the era, white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church during a Sunday morning service, killing four young girls.Jones would have loved to have gone on following events, he says, but he had places to be, like his wedding in Vancouver. He sent his rolls of film to London without having seen any of his images. Some of them he had never seen at all until his visit to the Observer office last week. “When I first started here, I didn’t know one end of the camera from the other,” he says.His career took him around the world, from Swinging London to Asian poverty, Soviet Russia to Afro-Caribbean immigrants in 1970s London. In Alabama, there was an aspect of “right place, right time”, but Jones’s images seem to convey the whole story, emotionally as well as factually. “People often say you’ve got to have a ‘good eye’,” he says. “But it’s not your eye that takes the pictures, it’s your brain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d57d52fe9b75328229f7a89a7018281d5b7a21bc/3_7_2908_1746/master/2908.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3165f5ec1072a93ae2c2ef255276ed05","title":"salary what get paid talk about it makes brits cringe","story":"There’s nothing that makes Brits cringe more than discussing our salaries.

Jeremy Corbyn’s last published tax return puts his income at £136,762 Theresa May’s was £117,350 but she hasn’t published one since she became prime minister David Cameron never published a tax return, but he did publish his earnings in light of the Panama Papers scandal: £200,307 from salary and rent in 201415. José Mourinho is on a reported £15m at Manchester United and is apparently unhappy. Chris Evans makes more than £2.2m at the BBC. A nurse starts at £22,128. It ought to be one of the least personal things about us – a simple data point, one that’s not so hard to estimate, surely – and yet clearly it’s emotive. “I don’t think that’s a very nice conversation to have publicly at all,” as Kate Winslet told the BBC when pressed on the issue of gender pay disparities in Hollywood a couple of years ago. “It seems quite a strange thing to be discussing out in the open like that. I am a very lucky woman and I’m quite happy with how things are ticking along.”How much do I earn now that I’m freelance? Not enough to turn down a commission from the , but a lot more than the national average: let’s leave it there for now. As I ask these “vulgar” questions of friends, family members and random strangers, I detect two main reasons for squeamishness. One, you might earn too little and be ashamed. Two, you might earn too much and be ashamed. Revealing your salary might bring a twitch on either string, depending on who you’re talking to.A fellow freelance writer on £26,000 confesses: “I do find it shameful to talk about because I feel like it’s not very much for someone who has had a lot of advantages in life.” At the other end of the income scale, there’s often a fear of being judged for having made certain compromises. “I wouldn’t share my salary because I’m quite embarrassed that I’m earning too much and still don’t feel it’s enough to live a comfortable London life,” says a friend who works in recruitment in the City. Another who classes herself as a “high earner” say she doesn’t want to be labelled a “corporate whore”.“I like to be on equal terms with people irrespective of our salaries,” she says. “While I regularly get the extra round or pay for dinner for friends who might not have as much cash, I don’t like there to be an expectation that I will do those things.” There are further reasons, too. “It makes me feel self-conscious and embarrassed about my relatively modest living arrangements and asset accumulation given my high salary. And I don’t like knowing when people earn more than me. It leads me to question whether I’m sufficiently successful and leaves me feeling dissatisfied with my lot.”The people most willing to share their figures, I find, are those who take a certain pride at having succeeded on their own terms. In 2012, Jack Monroe was on income support and in debt, with a food and fuel budget of less than £10 a week and a son to feed now she is a successful food writer with a couple of bestselling cookbooks to her name and a company employing four members of staff. “Mine is the last salary to be paid at the end of each month,” she says. “I pay my staff well. I don’t want the people I work with to find themselves in difficult circumstances.” She pays herself £21,000 a year which, given she works about 50 hours a week, she estimates as about half what she pays her cleaner (£14 an hour). “I probably don’t get paid as much as I should, but that’s a hit I’m prepared to take as I’m used to living on not much money. It’s a real skill being financially resilient and keeping your head.”My old university friend Simon, who has cerebral palsy, tells me he earns “closer to £40,000 than £50,000” as a policy research manager. “Very few people ever ask me this question as most of the occupants of our village who go down the pub seem to be either scientists for biopharma or financial masters of the universe which makes my salary seem puny,” he says. “Nonetheless, in terms of providing the nice things my family need, I feel well paid, and in terms of what my father gets paid – all I have ever really aspired to – I am doing OK as well. For me, it is also about being a disabled person – my quality of life is far better than many other people in my position typically expect and I feel profoundly lucky.”Still, a headline figure can be misleading. You might earn £10,000 working for a charity because you’re a saint you might also be married to a management consultant who makes six figures by laying other people off. You might turn down that slightly compromising commission because you have impeccable ethical credentials you might also have a trust fund. Also: which number do you choose? It’s customary to cite pre-tax income on job adverts in the UK, but it’s not in France and many other European countries – which immediately changes your relationship to that figure. If you’re self-employed, do you cite gross income (ie all the money you earned in a year), net profit (ie all that minus expenses) or post-tax income (ie all that minus the amount you pay in tax)? How do assets come into it?And what about benefits, tiny amounts, really, but which often incite just as much envy and resentment as, say, the £3.4m home secretary Sajid Javid is reckoned to have earned when he was at Deutsche Bank? It gets complicated. The first person I encounter in Bristol is Kirsten, 49, walking with a crutch with Snoop, her staffie cross. “We saved each other,” she says. Following failed surgery on a degenerative spinal condition, she lives on disability benefit and volunteers at a local hospital for the chronic pain management programme. “I don’t really know how much I get… I mean, I sort of know. But I’d rather not say.”She’s used to difficult conversations about pay. Before her operation, she spent most of her career administering mental health services for the local authority (“But that was cut due to funding reasons”) and went on to work in human resources for a small firm that recruited healthcare professionals. “It was so hard to make everything fair,” she says. “I’d be fighting for iniduals who’d been on minimum wage for a long time. There was a bit of hypocrisy going on in management, them all getting bonuses and the people at the bottom being on minimum wage.” Her current benefits are OK: “But it’s been a hard slog to fight for them.”People on lower wages – and especially on minimum wage – are generally fine with telling me. I catch Theresa, 54, a contract cleaner, just as she finishes her shift at a supermarket. “I was fortunate when I had my family because my husband had his own business, so I was ‘kept’ for a while. But then my husband got ill and was unable to continue with that. The benefits weren’t enough. He was lucky to find this cleaning job, but he found it a struggle with his medical condition – he lives on painkillers – so we were able to job-share. When he’s struggling I step up the pace and the company’s happy. And because we do a good job, we get sent here, there and everywhere as overtime.” The ability to share hours and fuel costs with her husband is a bonus. “But what goes in comes out.” After rent, council tax, bills and so on, she’s left with “pennies”.But she says she’s lucky. She likes the variety of locations, and the hours (approximately 5am-1pm) mean she can look after her grandchildren after school, so that her children can go to work. “My daughter-in-law starts work at five, finishes at one, comes home, hands my son the keys, and off he goes until 11 at night. If they do it that way, they don’t have to pay for childminders. And still at the end of the day, they haven’t got anything for what I call the little luxuries – you know? And that makes me quite cross.”Mickey, 58, is philosophical about the £23,000 he is paid as a park keeper by the council. “It’s not bad – but I could be earning more,” he reflects. “I used to have my own company and run my own contract here, but then the council took over and employed me.” He hasn’t had a pay rise for six years, so in effect his pay has gone down. But as a public sector employee, he can at least look up what his bosses are earning. According to the Bristol city council website, its highest paid positions are strategic directors (on £136,000) the salary ratio of highest-paid to lowest-paid employees is about 10:1. (Private companies will soon be obliged to publish this data, too.) However, the highest-paid roles are being replaced by new, even higher-paid roles: executive director (£135,000-£165,000), level two director (£94,000-£120,000) and level one director (£85,000-£105,000).But Mickey is philosophical. “They do a job,” he says. “They get paid the going rate. There are no tensions.” Indeed, he reckons his job is more enjoyable than theirs. “I grew up round here. My dad worked here. This is special, the best place in Bristol. I’d do this for no money.” Let’s hope no strategic directors read this.I notice Ed, 44, sitting at a table by the park cafe, tapping at his laptop in aviator shades. “I can tell you what I earn, but it’s weird – I’m not a normal 9-5 type person,” he says. “It’s nothing at the moment.” He recently returned from Austin, Texas, where he launched a craft cider business that paid him an annual salary of about $85,000 (£62,500) he sold most of his shares for about $2m (£1.47m) and is currently working out what to do next. In the meantime, that “nothing” includes an annual idend of about £25,000 a year from a cider bar he owns in Bristol.“I’m in an exceedingly lucky position,” he says. “I come from a pretty poor background. None of my old friends is a particularly high flyer – I’m kind of the friend that my mates take the piss out of for being rich. People tease me about what I’m going to do with the money.”He has always been of a “tax the rich” mindset, but now he has to adhere to that himself. “One of the things I hate is that when you go to see any accountant, the assumption is you want to pay the minimum amount of tax. That agenda is unhealthy.” To his surprise, his US accountant recently told him he was exempt from paying $370,000 tax he thought was due on the capital gains in his business, owing to a piece of post-financial crash-era legislation. So now he’s figuring out what to do with it. “I’d like to do something with a bit more social worth than just getting people drunk,” he says. “Maybe something political.”I speak to a couple of retirees whose dogs are entangled: David, 88, and Sue, 73. “We’ve just met,” David says. “She’s from Yorkshire, I’m a Bristol native.”“I’ve lived in Bristol 27 years, thank you very much.”David spent most of his career as a schoolteacher and a local government officer before that when I ask how much he earns, he says “nothing”, besides his state pension and his teacher’s pension. How much is that? “Aha!” he says. “I’m not telling you because you can find out.”“The same with me,” Sue adds. “It would be easy for you to find out. My state pension is the very basic state pension and it’s topped up by the very basic pension credit.” (She eventually discloses that it’s £120 a week, plus £101 top-up.)David considers reticence to be a British trait. Sue isn’t convinced. It depends where in Britain you’re from and when you were born. “I come from a mining village near Wakefield where everybody knew everybody’s business, so attitudes were completely different,” she says. “People were careful with money because there wasn’t a lot of it to go round. That’s the difference between then and now. There is too much of an attitude now of, ‘I want it, I’ll go out and get it.’ Then, if you couldn’t afford it, you didn’t have it.”“How much do you earn then?” David asks me.I still find these numbers a little limiting. How do you factor in security, for example? I have no pension, no sick pay or holiday, no idea what I will be doing next month, and recently lost my one regular source of income, so my bank balance fluctuates wildly. Or joint income? My wife, also a freelance writer, earns much less, so it’s ended up being me who pays all the bills, childcare, rent and so on. Or hours worked? Usually 60 a week? Journalism is not a growth industry. With a rough average of 40p a word, I must publish about 175,000 words a year, about two novels’ worth, to sustain it… And yet, I’m white and male, I’m not scraping sewers or toileting the elderly, and I feel the need to provide hundreds of extra words to justify my privilege (also: I’m paid by the word). I suppose my main worry is not what I earn now so much as what I’ll earn in the future. Is the industry sustainable? What will I do when I’m old? How does anyone else manage? The wider narrative since 2008 has been one of decline: work more, expect less, hope you get lucky. Short of envious of my fellow citizens, I’m simply impressed that anyone can make it work.I approach a man who’s quietly drinking a beer while looking after his baby daughter. He’s a stay-at-home dad for three days of the week and earns £15,000 from a couple of days lecturing at Bristol University. His wife works at Airbus and is the main breadwinner. “We had lots of clear conversations about how best to make it all work, economically and emotionally – and I’m certainly not resentful because we’re in a happy position where one of us can spend time with the children,” he says. “I think the conversation has matured. People recognise that to earn a stupid amount of money, you have to make sacrifices elsewhere.”Does he think Swedish-style salary transparency would help matters here? He sighs. “It would require such a change of mindset. Post-Brexit, I’ve lost a bit of faith in humanity, to be honest. As things roll on, that concept that we’re going through progress… you kind of think, huh. Maybe we can regress sometimes, too?”Three Hare Krishnas on a hill are playing a harmonium and chanting mantras in harmony. When I tell them I am going around asking people how much they earn, they all laugh.“That’s such a boring question!” says Jahnava, 45. “I thought it was going to be something juicy.” She works for a charity called Coracle, which provides her a salary of about £5,000. Woah, that’s not much, I say. “I rely on the Lord.” You would say that. What about food, shelter? “It’s provided by the charity.”Her friend Ellis, 22, has long blond hair and a shirt with lobsters and bananas on it. “I don’t know how much I earn – I don’t have a job right now,” he says. “I’m looking to get a portering job in the hospital, which would be about 18 grand, I think.” How does he support himself in the meantime? “I don’t know.” He laughs. “Jobseeker’s allowance. And lovely people around me. My grandparents give me a little bit of cash sometimes.”I mention that most people find these conversations difficult.“Maybe British people are too much in their minds?” Jahnava says. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how much money you have to live. If you have food, shelter and your health, there’s nothing to stop you from being completely content. I was watching this video of a famous person being followed around by the paparazzi, and I realised how these people have sacrificed all of their privacy and freedom for their fame and wealth. I wouldn’t give that up for any price.”• Commenting on this piece?

From channelling your inner Kate Moss and Love Island contestant to ditching the Woodstock look, here’s how to survive itYes, that’s even if you can remember them. Use the 90s revival as an excuse to be comfortable and look cool. You will need a pair of dungarees (think TLC), some tiny sunglasses (The Matrix) and a bumbag (Vanilla Ice … or not). Bonus: wannabe Spice Girls (yes, that is intentional) can even dig out, we mean buy, ginormous-soled Buffalo trainers. After all, what better way to walk through miles of mud?Nineteen sixty-nine is a long time ago. Enough time, you might think, for the Woodstock look to be to solely the territory of BBC4 documentaries and those who actually, you know, live in Woodstock. To be clear, a festival in 2018 is not an excuse to pretend you saw Hendrix do the Star-Spangled Banner, or wear flowers in your hair. Fringing and headbands are not OK. And anyone who commences body painting – unless they’re Keith Haring and Grace Jones at the Paradise Garage, obvs – is seriously in breach of the fashion commandments.The unwritten rule that you don’t wear the band’s T-shirt to the gig has been broken by fashion – soz, musos. Now, merch is the statement you want to make in your field of choice. It can take the form of caps – Kendrick Lamar’s What Happens on Earth Stays on Earth – or T-shirts. Bieber’s are a merch classic, and we can only imagine what Beyoncé and Jay-Z will bring come their tour in June.So, there’s you. You booked your ticket ages ago and had the date marked in your diary for months. Then there’s RihannaLady GagaGwen StefaniPJ Harveydelete as appropriate. They arrive at the site by osmosis, or possibly a helicopter, and remain backstage until they perform, unscathed by the surroundings, in anything from a dress made of mirrors to a perspex headpiece with Hellraiser vibes. Last year, Rihanna wore a Gucci chainmail bodysuit to Coachella, just to hang out in her trailer. Imagine trying to use a Shewee in one of those.Sure, in other ways, Moss’s lifestyle is not exactly easy to attain: the Count boyfriend, the holiday schedule, the house in the Cotswolds. But her festival look is by numbers – in a good way. Moss knows that when you’re out in the wilds, you should stick to the classics: jean cut-offs, sunglasses, wellies and a biker jacket. It may not be the height of innovation but is the best thing when you’re battling an easterly gale and trying to keep the lager in your cardboard cup unharmed. Goals.Alexa Chung is the patron saint of modern festival dressing. She has done it all: PVC trousers, slip dresses and over-the-knee socks, often with a Barbour, usually with a bit of side eye. These are clothes that suit someone walking through the backstage area pretending they don’t notice photographers. They are not the kind of thing to wear when “having a wash” translates to using a couple of wet wipes in your wonky tent.Wings seem to have faded from fashion, but the vestiges of the child’s dressing-up-box remain. Paris Hilton has a lot to answer for: her Coachella look last year involved a rainbow frock and cat ears. And it goes without saying, no Native American headdresses, bindis or anything that can be perceived as cultural appropriation. Not in a festival, not IRL, not anywhere. Not OK.

Wonder brought up West without prompting during an interview on Thursday after a show at a West Hollywood club. “There’s been a lot of talk about what was said by Kanye,” Wonder said. “I want people to understand that the truth is the truth and a lie is a lie. “We all know that slavery was not a choice. So I just think that people need to understand that if you know your history, if you know the truth, you know that’s just foolishness.” Wonder said saying slavery was a choice was like saying the Holocaust was not real.West made the remarks in an interview with TMZ earlier this month. “When you hear about slavery for 400 years, for 400 years, that sounds like choice,” West said. He defended his statements and did not back down from them on Twitter after widespread criticism. An email to his representatives seeking a response to Wonder’s comments was not immediately returned. Wonder spoke softly, not angrily, and said he also felt sympathy for West, especially over the rapper losing his mother, who died after having cosmetic surgery procedures in 2007. “You know he lost his mother, the horrible thing that happened,” Wonder said. “I don’t know if he had a chance to really mourn about all that.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c9316817994bf7144c2dd538b8c707c65743ce/0_157_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64e6fb77c04265843185f24b3b721a40","title":"the rise of donald glover childish gambino","story":"The award-winning writer, actor, singer and rapper has dominated the internet with his provocative, politically charged hit This is America, the latest step in an illustrious, unconventional careerTry, if you can, to watch This Is America, the new music video from Childish Gambino, while keeping your eyes off the man in the camera’s gaze. It’s not easy. You may have to watch it twice, maybe three times, probably more. In the clip, Childish Gambino is a dancing, running, alternately homicidal and joyous streak of shirtless charisma. Your eyes want to follow him, soak him in. But if you do, you’ll miss the point he seems to be making in the video, an enigmatic and provocative effort that has accumulated over 74m YouTube views and hundreds of thinkpieces in the six days since its release.So instead, try directing your attention on all that’s happening in the background as Childish Gambino – the musical moniker of multi-hyphenate artist Donald Glover – moves through a spare industrial space in a succession of meditative tracking shots that serve as steady foundation for the frenetic action they capture.There are children in school uniforms doing dances of African and American origin. There is a white horse with a hooded rider. There are police. There are people running across the upper level of the space that looks increasingly like a prison as the video progresses. There are chickens, girls on bicycles, money in the air, mobs running in riot-like pandemonium. There are kids lost in their cellphones, car fires, SZA sitting on the hood of what appears to be a 1986 Camry.While Childish Gambino is surely the star – playing the role some have suggested is America itself – viewed in context of the background action, the video is dizzying, hypnotic treatise on racism, gun violence, joy, spirituality, hip-hop and entertainment in the United States. Its symbolism has been linked to Jim Crow, Michael Jackson and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. YouTube videos investigating these Easter eggs have more views than many actual music videos.Since debuting This Is America during last week’s episode of Saturday Night Live – for which he served as host and musical guest – Glover has refused to reveal the video’s message, telling TMZ “that’s not for me to say.” What’s certain is that This Is America is a brilliant, career-defining moment. “This is one of the great performers in modern America,” says TV host Touré, whose books include 2012’s Who’s Afraid of Post-Blackness? “He’s showing a really interesting ability to do soul music, television, movies, comedy and drama and to make art that has political substance, but not so much that it becomes propagandist or preachy.”This Is America has dared us to decide what to make of it. The video’s background action commences immediately after the video hits it pivot point: Childish Gambino pulling a gun from his pants and shooting a hooded man in the back of the head, execution style. This is when he declares the song’s guiding principle: “This is America.”The implication is that the brutal violence and general mayhem is no different than daily life in the US, where guns, entrenched racism and police brutality against black Americans dominate the headlines. Gambino goes on to kill a gospel choir in a moment evoking the 2015 Charleston massacre, in which nine people died during a prayer service at one the country’s oldest black churches. The guns are handled with great care, being wrapped in red cloth some believe symbolizes red-state second-amendment reverence. Meanwhile, limp bodies are casually pulled out of the frame.Others view This is America as a clear critique of the way such violence is digested by a culture in which mass shootings and the killing of unarmed black men are so common that we have become numb to them, distracted by entertainment in the same way the video’s joyous dance sequences distract us from chaos in the background.The video was directed by Hiro Murai, who also directs Atlanta, the half-hour series Glover, 34, writes, produces and stars in. (His brother Stephen serves as co-writer and head story editor.) The show follows rapper Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), his cousinmanager Earn (Glover) their friend Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) and Earn’s girlfriend Van (Zazie Beetz) as they maneuver through the Atlanta rap scene. In its two seasons Atlanta has been widely celebrated, and awarded, for its honest, melancholic, darkly funny and often surreal take on black America.“Atlanta is the best show on TV, period,” Chris Rock said in a March New Yorker profile of Glover. Jordan Peele noted: “For black people, Atlanta provides the catharsis of ‘Finally, some elevated black shit.’”In fact, Peele used Childish Gambino’s biggest hit Redbone during the opening credits of Get Out, his Oscar winning 2017 horror film about the daily terrors of being black in America. The biggest hit from Childish Gambino’s 2016 LP Awaken, My Love! Redbone is a slinky gospel slow ride showcasing Gambino’s soulful (and surprisingly high-pitched) vocals. “Stay woke,” the song’s chorus implores, a message that for Get Out’s protagonist Chris was a foreboding warning of the threats to come. “Stay woke, that’s what this movie is about,” Peele said of the song during a 2017 interview with HipHopDX. “I wanted to make sure this movie satisfied the black core movie audience need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent, observant people would do.”Redbone won the 2018 Grammy for best traditional R\u0026ampB performance, an award Glover presumably put on his shelf alongside the two Emmys and pair of Golden Globes he’s picked up for Atlanta. The album from which Redbone came itself earned three Grammy nominations and demonstrated a marked evolution from Childish Gambino’s first two albums, which were defined by a jokey internet humor, more straightforward beats and rhyming and lyrics the Pitchfork review of 2013’s Because The Internet equated to a Christmas ham.Awaken, My Love! found Childish Gambino dropping the structure of his previous output in favor of lushly layered psychedelic fun in the tradition of George Clinton and vocals reminiscent of Prince at his most soulful. Lyrics evoked the same surreal sense of dread that permeates some of Atlanta’s best scenes – “All I see is zombies  Feeding all around us  All they eat are people  and you won’t survive,” Gambino sings on Zombies – and forecasted the complicated racial politics of This Is America. Childish Gambino debuted the album with three shows in California’s new age desert nexus of Joshua Tree, performing in glow-in-the-dark body paint. Cameras were expressly forbidden. “He always had technique and talent and was always clearly a good rapper,” says Touré. “But it was this funny kind of jokey hip-hop. To see him develop into a very soulful, Parliament-style sort of R\u0026ampB artist, it’s extraordinary.” “It sounds like I’m sucking my own dick – ‘Oh, he thinks he’s great at everything,” Glover said in the New Yorker, describing his lifelong ability to identify the algorithms that would make him successful at anything he attempted, “But what if you had that power?” What Glover was saying is that he knows he does, and there is little reason to doubt him. He can rap while perfectly executing the South African Gwara Gwara, start a massive cultural conversation and earn unbridled praise in the process. (“Donald Glover is a Genius,” Erykah Badu tweeted after the video’s release, while Janelle Monáe’s tweet of just Glover’s name received over 5,000 retweets.) He makes one of the decade’s landmark television shows and has won many prestigious awards. At the end of the month, he joins one of the most successful movie franchises of all time as Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Star War Story. Next year, he’ll play Simba in the live-action reboot of The Lion King. He left his gig as a staff writer for 30 Rock after three years because he wanted to focus on acting, and left his role in the beloved series Community because he wanted to focus on music. He’s suggested that the next Childish Gambino album will be his last, as he’s bored with the project. Given the scope of his career thus far, Glover’s statement indeed seems less self-fellating and more a sober assessment of the extraordinary gifts he’s fully aware he possesses. Gifts that, much like in the extraordinary joy and terrible violence of the video, are hard to look away from.

If you love J Dilla more than your firstborn, this is the festival for you. As previously mentioned, for the first time since its inception in 2007, Field Day won’t be taking place in its spiritual home of HackneyTower Hamlets.

Fifteen years later, and Download is stuck with its oh-so-2003 name, but it’s also one of the most joyous festivals in the UK, home to one of music’s last staunch tribes: the mighty metaller.

Namely, that after 11 consecutive Reading and Leeds festivals (plus a dozen or so Glastonburys, a handful of T in the Parks, a sprinkling of Indietracks and the occasional depressing event set up in a massive Portuguese car park and most probably headlined by Muse), your memories are likely to be somewhat squiffy. They’re the kind of memories that have been doused in several litres of Lightning Strike cider, left to marinate in a hedge for four days and woken up with ill-advised tribal facepaint. And, like the bearded man in the healing fields who claims he can levitate through the 17th dimension, they’re probably not to be trusted. So when I check my own festival memories I have to wonder if many of them actually happened. Did I really see a baby in a buggy crowdsurfing through a packed field? Can it be true that I carried one of my friends across a mud-plagued Glastonbury site while he told passing strangers that he was the supreme ruler of the universe, only to then watch him pass out in a toilet block and urinate on himself? Was the night I spent inhaling toxic plastic fumes as tents and toilet blocks were set ablaze around me a figment of my imagination, a fever dream brought on after eating an undercooked chicken pad thai?Whether it’s watching Kevin Rowland confuse an entire crowd by wearing white stockings and suspenders or witnessing Michael Eavis redefine the very definition of the term “singing” while onstage with Stevie Wonder, the thing about festival memories is that they often take on a strange, hallucinatory air. Sure, you buy your ticket to watch Oasis or Beyoncé or Skepta – but then you come back telling friends that actually you went to see six shows by a fully grown man pretending to be a lobster while singing Christmas songs instead.That is the whole glorious point. The best festivals should exist at the point where reality and surreality meet, and your mind is no longer completely sure what’s happening. There should be giant spiders spouting fire, DJ sets that involve you climbing onstage to dance in your wellies, and deep and meaningful conversations about life, the universe and where you put your last piece of chewing gum.You’re left with a muddy mountain of experiences, many of which are hard to verify and almost all of which have no application once back in the real world. It’s unlikely that many potential employers out there are going to be impressed by your ability to fashion semi-waterproof shoes out of two Sainsbury’s bags and a lanyard. Remembering where your tent is located at 5am after several hours in the rave fields might be a game-changer at the time but it doesn’t really translate to anything particularly useful in the office environment. But that’s not important. What’s important at a festival is that you had the best possible time – and that’s especially likely to be the case if you can barely remember any of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03190ab93ee8e611ed4680d0b7c3eded29f2be62/0_0_3000_2005/master/3000.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b57ade087e9eb23d6b9a6324a9c3bb2b 720w","title":"brexit customs standoff could go on for another week sources","story":"Ministers pessimistic about prospect of finding solution, with two rival plans in playResolving the cabinet standoff over customs after Brexit could take another week or more, senior government sources say, as ministers prepare to meet in breakout groups to thrash out the rival proposals.Theresa May has ided members of her deadlocked Brexit inner cabinet into two groups, tasked with tweaking the two rival plans to find an acceptable compromise.But ministers remain pessimistic about the prospect of finding a workable solution, with one comparing the process of wearing down their opponents with the Marathon des Sables, an endurance race across the Sahara.“It feels like everyone’s quite entrenched,” said another senior source.The impasse has stalled negotiations in Brussels, and is becoming increasingly politically embarrassing for May, who was challenged by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, about the “shambles” of her negotiating strategy in parliament on Wednesday.A spokesman for the prime minister said on Friday: “We think both options have merit, we’re discussing both of them further. The groups reflect the issues that have been raised in relation to the two models. The groups are working through these issues of priority and need to come up with the right solution.”He added: “We are not setting any further deadlines for ourselves apart from October. That continues to be our focus.” October is the deadline by which the government hopes to agree the outlines of a trade deal, to allow time for parliament to ratify it.But the EU27 have stressed that they want to see progress on the Irish border issue in particular before the European Council meets next month.The depth of the isions in cabinet burst into the open last week, with the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, describing May’s favoured customs partnership as “crazy”.The Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve, who has repeatedly challenged the government over its Brexit plans, said Johnson should resign if he disagreed so profoundly with other members of the cabinet.“The prime minister has a difficult task and I don’t think it’s helped by this tendency of the foreign secretary to express himself,” he told the . “If you don’t like a policy, you leave the government. That’s what you should do. If there are problems, you either accept them or you have to go. That’s your choice.” Asked if that meant he thought Johnson should resign, he said: “He should resign. Yes.”But allies of Johnson stress that both proposals remain in play, and point out that the business secretary, Greg Clark, has spoken out in favour of the partnership plan.The cabinet breakout groups have already met once and will gather again on Monday.Brexiters remain deeply sceptical about the customs partnership, which also has the backing of Philip Hammond, and would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU.This “hybrid model”, as it is also known, will be discussed by the group including David Lidington, Liam Fox and Michael Gove. Brexiters fear it will force Britain to remain too close to the EU copying the bloc’s product standards and regulations, for example.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.One Brexiter suggested the prime minister may be hoping the persuasive Lidington can “flip” Gove or Fox.The other group will discuss the so-called “max fac” proposal favoured by the Brexit secretary, David Davis. It relies on technology to minimise border checks, but its opponents believe it cannot resolve the Irish border issue.Davis will have to try to convince Clark and the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, that it can be tweaked in such a way that it can work. But backers of the customs partnership believe max fac would never get through the Commons.Negotiators in Brussels are ready to resume talks with the UK as soon as the government has a preferred solution and have laid out a series of questions about the customs partnership, having initially dismissed the idea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c09df26be112836df19d517d49fd05ed255f02e/0_0_3056_1834/master/3056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e104ea4e0729ef9159acba913d22206","title":"jeremy corbyn must change course on eea says lord kinnock","story":"Former Labour leader says Corbyn’s objections to European Economic Area membership are based on ‘infantile leftist illusion’Jeremy Corbyn will commit a “serious evasion of duty” if he does not change course and back the UK retaining key aspects of the single market after Brexit, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has said.In a strongly worded attack, the peer signalled that Labour MPs should defy Corbyn if he repeats instructions to abstain in parliamentary votes on Britain staying in the European Economic Area (EEA).A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group.

I respect our Labour leadership in the Lords and I value loyalty. But I have also said that the virtue, in excess, fills graveyards.“In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering, sacrificing, thousands of skilled and decently paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities.”Kinnock, who led Labour between 1983 and 1992, added: “The objections to supporting EEA membership from some in the upper reaches of the Labour party seem to centre on claims that it would either restrict a Labour government’s freedom of socialist action or that it would mean ignoring our supporters who voted to leave the EU, or both.“The first of these claims is based on falsehood. The EEA is open to member states of the EU or the European Free Trade Association.“Neither the EEA nor the EU are part of the socialist superstate of neocon delusion or of the global capitalist adventure playground of infantile leftist illusion.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d66b96cef2d907733ac3446ebaacc240ab09d4de/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3e740218b90591cad515fa14ca019f0","title":"tuc march for new deal for workers draws thousands in london","story":"Government must change course or face strikes, unions say at London’s biggest march in yearsThe government faced calls for a major change of direction on public services, pay and jobs on Saturday as tens of thousands of people marched through central London to demand a “new deal”.Jeremy Corbyn won huge applause from the crowds in Hyde Park when he pledged that the next Labour government would create a ministry to guarantee workers’ rights.The Labour leader accused the Conservatives of cutting public spending while protecting those who dodge taxes. “We will give workers more power, by strengthening their rights and freedoms to organise together to improve their lives,” he said.Union members and campaigners from across the UK travelled to the capital for the demonstration, which was organised by the TUC. It said that a decade on from the financial crisis, real wages were still worth £24 a week less than they were in 2008 and were not expected to return to pre-crash levels until 2025.At that point, real wages in the UK will have been in decline for 17 years, during which time the average worker will have lost out on about £18,500 in real earnings, it said.Frontline workers including nurses, ambulance crews, postal workers, teachers, civil servants and cleaners marched to call for a higher minimum wage, a ban on zero-hours contracts and more funding for the NHS and other public services. Workers involved in current disputes, including those at restaurant chains TGI Fridays and McDonald’s and at rail companies over the role of train guards, also took part in what was the biggest demonstration in years.The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “There is a new mood in the country. People have been very patient but they are now demanding a new deal for decent jobs, fair wages, to fund public services and for strong trade unions. “You can’t hand out bumper idends to shareholders and cut workers’ wages. You can’t fill your boots in the boardroom and tell workers to tighten their belts, and you can’t build world-class companies on the back of second-class rights. The greed has to stop.” The general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Dave Ward, said: “This is the start of a serious challenge for a new deal for all workers.

He started lying about where he had been and became defensive when asked questions knives began going missing from the kitchen and money would turn up in his bedroom.“Odd items started appearing in the house like money and cigarettes – he used to be very anti-smoking. Then he suddenly went missing for more than a week. That’s when things took a turn in a different direction,” Helen says.Tom was eventually found by police, who told Helen her son had been groomed by a gang. From that point on, Tom fell deeper into the murky world of “county lines” drug trading, in which young people are recruited by dealers who offer them money to sell drugs in out-of-town locations.“He was always 10 steps ahead of everyone. Everyone’s hands were tied and we did not know how to find him or where he was. It was extremely frustrating,” Helen says.“He was exploited and he was a victim, but we were told he was choosing this lifestyle of criminality.” She says this attitude stopped Tom from being referred to the national referral mechanism under modern slavery laws, which ensures they receive appropriate support. “That is a big failure by professionals and it stops kids.”Last year, Tom nearly died after being stabbed, but such assaults are not uncommon in county lines. The National Crime Agency reported last year that county lines groups “impose high levels of violence, including the prevalent use of weapons and firearms to intimidate and control members of the group and associated victims”.Helen says a lot of stabbings are the result of turf wars, and social media is also a trigger. “There is a feeling of not valuing their own lives. They are prepared to lead a short life as long as it is a life of bling and status. They don’t care if they are not going to live a long and healthy life ... When you have that situation, where someone is prepared to die young ... how do you compete with that?” she says.She adds that since being stabbed, Tom has changed but she is not sure it is enough to make him quit that lifestyle. “We are having better conversations now, and he has been unreachable for a long time. When you are involved in these gangs you are taught to hate the police and to hate your parents. I am grateful we can communicate relatively well now.”But escaping county lines dealing is not straightforward. “They say eight ways in and one way out,” Helen says.The experience has taken a heavy toll on the family. “He bears no resemblance to my own son, he is a different human being. Lots of parents would not be able to deal with that and it’s easy to throw your child out in that situation, but I knew he hadn’t chosen the lifestyle. He had been groomed and whatever happened had been done to him,” Helen explains.What does she think of how the problem is being tackled by the government? She believes not enough people like her, who have lived through it, are being consulted on how to combat it.“The strategies around tackling serious violence don’t often involve listening to those who have lived it. But we should for our children. We owe it to them if an experience highlights a flaw in the system, people should pay attention and ask ‘where are we going wrong and how can we fix it?’” • All names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3d4ced51a18a6db00be7c55124374aa871d5954/0_118_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e87bdf6a862807ec5b16d3cf67365f0","title":"ireland pakistan test cricket day two match report","story":"Soon after 10am, the Irish players gathered together on the outfield while the chair of selectors, Andrew White, set down a scruffy cardboard box full of handsome new caps. He handed them out one by one, the first to captain William Porterfield, then the rest in alphabetical order, Andy Balbirnie, Ed Joyce, Tyrone Kane, Tim Murtagh, Kevin and Niall O’Brien, Boyd Rankin, Paul Stirling, Stuart Thompson and Gary Wilson. The first Irish Test XI. At least a couple of them started to cry, some who were playing from pride, some who were not from sorrow. Then, their coach, Graham Ford, cut them short. “Let’s get moving.”The Irish cricket community is small, but proud and enthusiastic. Over the years a lot of boys and men who love or loved the game have entertained daydreams of playing in a Test match for Ireland. In their minds, it might have looked something just like this Saturday. A bright, warm May morning at the pretty little ground, not a cloud in the sky, but 5,000 fans in the grandstands, family and friends and team-mates all around and the opposition reeling. This after Porterfield, following Friday’s washout, had won the toss, and became the first captain to choose to bowl in his country’s first Test.Porterfield’s side were stacked with right-arm medium-fast bowlers, his two openers, Murtagh and Rankin, much the best and most experienced of them. The next, Thompson and Kane, have played a handful of first-class games between them, and the last, Kevin O’Brien, is strictly part-time. But Pakistan’s batting line-up was callow, too. They had given a debut to Imam-ul-Haq and Faheem Ashraf, their No3, Haris Sohail has played two Tests before this, and their No5, Babar Azam, 11. The pitch was damp and grassy and Porterfield reckoned Pakistan’s batsmen might be vulnerable.Porterfield was right. They looked nervous from the first ball, which was a slapstick bit of business. Murtagh, ever so tense after the “spine-tingling” cap ceremony, over-pitched so the delivery landed right up by Azhar Ali’s feet.“That first ball is something I’ve been thinking about for a while,” Murtagh said. He’d been telling himself to “bowl a magic ball, bowl a magic ball” and instead “I missed my length by about a yard” so it came out as a floaty yorker. Azhar patted the ball down to the ground, stared at it for a split second, then set off on a quick single.Imam came haring up from the non-striker’s end and as he ed for the line he collided with both the keeper, Niall O’Brien and Kane, who was sprinting in from square-leg. Imam was knocked flat and for a moment it looked like he might be seriously injured. He passed his concussion test though and was back on his feet and batting again five minutes later. As Murtagh said: “The first ball in Test cricket’s probably never taken so long.”In the stands, everyone seemed to know each other, but not what to expect from this Test. The Irish crowd know the game, and love it, so were quick and keen to applaud Imam when he hit the first four, through cover. They were quicker and keener, mind, when Rankin got Azhar out soon after, caught at second slip, and then Murtagh dismissed Imam lbw with the next ball. Murtagh was bowling brilliantly and almost had Asad Shafiq caught at slip later in the over.Porterfield chose this as the moment to make his first change and brought on Kane. A group of his club-mates were watching, unable to believe that their pal, a 23-year-old who has not played so much as a county match, was now a Test cricketer. They seemed every bit as nervous for him as he must have felt himself. Kane started with a no-ball but after that he settled into it well, his second over a maiden. As Porterfield said, he bowled better than his final figures, 18-2-84-0, suggested.As the morning wore on, Pakistan rallied, and Shafiq and Sohail batted through to lunch.The afternoon ebbed and flowed. Thompson found that Test cricket was as easy as whanging the ball down and waiting for the batsmen to play a bad shot. He had Sohail caught in the gully and Sarfraz in the slips. Inbetween, Murtagh got Azam and Rankin did for Shafiq, who was the only man in the top order who settled. Shafiq put together a careful 62 before Rankin switched to bowling short and had him caught at square-leg.At that point Pakistan were 159 for six. But they finished well. Faheem and Shadab Khan rattled their way to half-centuries so by the close they were 268 for six, as Ireland’s fielders flapped at a couple of catches. It had been a long day, the first of many."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10bbf877f5d48a3d4cf692b24ca4440f8863fc68/0_176_5239_3143/master/5239.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59e6f8f4c276469583fe1621c4426283","title":"racing 92 leinster european rugby champions cup match report","story":"Irish rugby’s remarkable year shows absolutely no sign of ending. By no stretch of the imagination was this a classic final but it is impossible to deny the scale of Leinster’s achievement in becoming only the second team in history to win four European Cups. Given Ireland’s Six Nations grand slam and potentially a Pro14 title as well, their 2017-2018 season has been a rhapsody in green and blue.Even if Remi Tales’s last-gasp drop-goal attempt not been deflected wide, Leinster would have fancied outlasting opponents who were already down to their third choice fly-half within three minutes of the game starting. First the great Dan Carter pulled out before kick-off with a tweaked hamstring, denying the former All Black a fairytale finish to a wonderfully successful career, and the South African Pat Lambie soon followed, limping from the fray having been collared high by Johnny Sexton. With the influential Maxime Machenaud and Dimitri Szarzewski sitting injured in the stands, they did well to come as close to upsetting Leinster as they did.The only consolation for their multimillionaire owner Jacky Lorenzetti is that his squad also has increasing depth to it. Teddy Iribaren might be miles down the French scrum-half rankings but the 27-year-old has the sweetest of left boots and almost wrenched the title away from Nacewa’s side. From the first minutes, when a high tackle wide out on the left by Garry Ringrose cost three points, Leinster knew they were in a proper battle.As their semi-final win against Munster demonstrated, Racing are big, powerful and particularly dangerous when they have some momentum. The presence of their own fired-up Irish international Donnacha Ryan in the second row alongside Leone Nakarawa also ensured they would not fold meekly, as evidenced when Ryan took a sickening tumble from a lineout and, ignoring the pain, played on regardless.Racing were also harassing Leinster on the gain-line and at the breakdown, having clearly boned up on what happens to teams who allow the likes of Dan Leavy free rein. A collapsed maul gave Iribaren, who is of Basque stock, the chance to chip over another three points and restore Racing’s lead, and only when Leinster opted for more of an aerial game did the French side start to look more uncertain.Leinster were also guilty of making some odd decisions. Awarded a penalty barely 15 metres out, Sexton opted not to kick for goal or the corner, instead taking a quick tap and giving the ball to Leavy who was instantly turned over by the hefty Racing hooker Camille Chat. In a low-scoring final in damp conditions it was an untypically slack piece of game management.It was not an easy match, either, for the referee Wayne Barnes, who was forced to adjudicate on any number of hairline infractions in a claustrophobic first 40 minutes. Nakarawa was slightly fortunate not to receive a yellow card for sticking out an involuntary hand and blocking a promising Leinster attack, underlining the slimness of the margins involved and the ambiguity of the law. A deliberate, cynical slap down of a potential scoring pass is clearly deserving of 10 minutes in the bin but players and supporters are now appealing for pretty much anything.The contest needed something more uplifting to entrance neutrals royally entertained the previous evening by Cardiff Blues and Gloucester in the Challenge Cup final. It did not materialise in the third quarter as both sides were sucked into an increasingly error-strewn, staccato dogfight. Jordi Murphy was penalised for not rolling away, giving Iribaren another straightforward three points, and Sexton made a complete hash of a long-range penalty attempt which, in golfing terms, barely made the fairway.The fly-half made amends six minutes later to level the scores again, only to watch a subsequent penalty drift just wide. A high tackle by Leavy on Henry Chavancy gave Racing another chance but this time Teddy proved less steady. The possibility of extra-time began to loom but Nacewa’s two late penalties ultimately spared his team-mates that brutal fate.Whether it inspires millions of Spanish kids to replace their Real Madrid and Barcelona posters with pictures of Tadhg Furlong is doubtful, but, as a gospel-spreading exercise, this weekend has been a definite success. Next year the finals weekend will be held in Newcastle, where some Leinster supporters have apparently already booked hotel rooms. It may well prove a very shrewd investment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97eb9e99028e534b913f7941739dfccd20d8c14d/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25dfd8666fed35ec3f63c82bd429c67b","title":"leinster v racing 92 european rugby champions cup final live","story":"Isa Nacewa’s late penalty confirmed a record-equalling fourth European Cup for Leinster in a bruising encounterHere’s Robert Kitson’s match report from Bilbao.Thanks for reading. Enjoy your evening. The whole Leinster team sprint en masse to the Leinster fans behind the posts and celebrate wildly with them, popping champagne corks and belting out “campiones!”.The captain, Isa Nacewa, in his final season at the club, plants his hands on the trophy and then invites as many of his team-mates as he can to grab it with him, before hoiking it aloft! He kicked the winning points too! What a day for him.Racing’s defeated players make their way up to receive their runners-up medals. Iribaren collects his with blood dripping down his forehead. What a performance he put in. And now it’s Leinster’s turn to pick up the European Cup. Stuart Lancaster is enjoying getting hugs off whoever is within range of him. He looks delighted. His restoration as a coaching force feels like it is complete after his bruising experience at the World Cup with England. Dan Carter, who was injured today and couldn’t play for Racing, says: “I’m really proud of the boys. We stuck in there for the majority of the game but we just made a few mistakes in the final five or 10 minutes. We play for each other like a family. You can see that from the way we were defending today. I’m really proud of what we have achieved this year.” A delighted Johnny Sexton speaks: “Wow. We did it the hard way. We couldn’t get going at all. Every time we got into their 22 the ball was killed. They got out and slowed us down at the ruck. I can’t believe we’re champions again. I never thought it would happen three or four years ago. Stuart Lancaster has done so well since he has come in. The belief he has instilled in us.”And that’s that! Racing played incredibly well – and worked so hard – against the heavy favourites but Leinster have won a record fourth European Cup, joining Toulouse as European royalty.80 min: Racing drive forwards and get Talès within range – but under pressure he lets fly … and misses to the left. That is so, so cruel. But Leinster won’t care.79 min: Racing steal back possession straight away. They have competed so, so well today. This is their last chance. Can they get to within range for a drop-goal? Boom! Nacewa takes Leinster to within a minute and a half of a fourth European Cup.77 min: Penalty to Leinster right in front of the posts! Leinster were building through the phases and offside was given against Racing. It’s going to be Nacewa to take it – in his last European game!75 min: Vakatawa tries to steal the ball from Kearney in Leinster’s half and is penalised. Sexton finds touch and Leinster have a lineout on Racing’s 22. Nakarawa steals it but his good work is undone by Thomas, who trots out of play and gives Leinster another lineout.Nacewa strokes it home with his right foot. His kicking hasn’t been great today but the captain showed his experience there and nailed it when it really mattered.72 min: Leinster are stung by that and make good progress up the right, with Ringrose stretching his legs. There are some massive hits and then Iribaren is penalised for a no-arms tackle and Nacewa, not Sexton, is going to go for goal from a right-centre position from 35 metres. Sexton is perhaps feeling a hit.He holds his nerve and sticks it right between the posts, cool as you like. What a game he’s having. 70 min: Racing set up a driving maul from a lineout on the right and make good ground. An infringement is given against Porter and Iribaren calls for teh kicking tee. It’s right over on the touchline, though. 68 min: But it’s turned over and Leavy is in like a terrier dog to pluck the ball away and hoof clear. Racing are on top here, though with just under 10 minutes remaining. . 66 min: Gibson-Park, now at scrum-half in place of McGrath, whacks a ball clear. Racing pick up possession and gather in numbers on the right, where they scramble through gaps before Talès dinks a kick through to take Racing up to around 15 metres. Good pressure from Racing. Henshaw goes mano-a-mano with the huge figure of Vakatawa and forces Racing back a few metres. We’re through 14 phases and the French fans are in full voice. 65 min: Penalty missed! His left foot powers the ball towards the posts but it drifts this far wide of the left post. Will anyone turn this game to their advantage. We need some magic! 64 min: This is so tight. Utterly attritional. Racing make a few metres from a lineout but a high tackle gives Iribaren a chance to put Racing 92 in front with a penalty from 45 yards. It’s by no means an easy kick.63 min: Leinster’s replacements are brought into action. Conan, Gibson-Park and Tracy are on for Murphy, Cronin and Luke McGrath. Meanwhile, Sexton is being treated for an unspecified injury. He should be able to continue though. Yes, he gets up and carries on. 61 min: Finally, Luke McGrath gets the ball in and out and Henshaw tries to carry but finds little room. Murphy has the ball dislodged from his arms but Leinster pick it up and Ringrose attempts to make some ground on the left … but the ball’s turned over and then Racing make a slapstick mess of kicking clear.60 min: Leinster have a strong bench and their replacement have just got up en-masse to warm up. I tell you this as the scrum is being reset over and over again, which is all a bit tedious.59 min: Chat mishandles and knocks on under pressure from Ryan inside his own 22. He’s then replaced by Avei and looks very disappointed with himself. It’s a Leinster scrum.57 min: Penalty missed! Sexton’s kick drifts about a foot wide to the right. The length was good, though. But Leinster seem to getting on top now. They’re finding pockets of space now, where previously there were none.56 min: Racing make three changes and Leinster bring Jack McGrath on for Healy. And then Leinster win a penalty for a no arms tackle. It’s all about the boot. And Sexton is going to try to put his side in front from all of 45 yards. Will Leinster take the lead?55 min: There’s a huge hit from Gomes Sa on Murphy as Racing plough into Leinster from the kick-off. McGrath finds the touchline.That was more like it from Sexton. He nails it straight down the middle.52 min: The Leinster fans are willing their team on as they begin to show some skill in midfield, offloading swiftly and finally forcing a penalty. This time from around 35 metres out.50 min: Leinster try the central route, Henshaw barging through a group of players, before Sexton boots long, pinning Racing back.49 min: Penalty missed! Sexton, obviously trying to give that kick as much biff as he can, drags it horribly to the left. 48 min: Leinster win a penalty for an offside 10 metres inside their own half. Some backchat takes the penalty 10 yards forwards and Sexton opts to go for the posts.46 min: Some housekeeping. Avei has replaced Chat, who has gone off for a head assessment. From an angle just left of centre, the scrum-half sweeps it through the posts with his left foot. 44 min: Racing work through the phases earning only inches on the gain line – but then Arous spins cleverly and takes the ball to within five metres. Leinster’s defensive line is strong though. Racing switch play with some skilful hands and try down the right with Thomas but Leinster hold firm again. Advantage was given at some point through those 20 phases, though. Penalty!42 min: But Leinster steal it and Healy bursts through a pocket before possession is turned over and Racing work their way forwards to the Leinster 22 metre line.41 min: McGrath sends a box-kick forwards and Leinster win possession. Then Nacewa has a chance to kick and run on the left wing but the ball comes off his foot at a horrible angle and Racing win a lineout.40 min: No changes at half-time. We’re off. Will it be another bruising 40 or will someone find their groove?

Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden?

There are four locations – Higginson Park in Marlow, Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and Knutsford, Cheshire – to choose from. Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in. Let’s not forget the soundtrack – brought to you live by the likes of Tom Odell and Razorlight.www.pubintheparkuk various dates between 17 May and 9 SeptemberSee a film under the starsIf you see one film this summer, just make sure it is outdoors. When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film.

Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope. Don’t miss the brilliant Letters Live, which returns for a fifth year.hayfestival 24 May-3 JuneWatch iconic bandsWhen it’s live music you want, settling on which summer festival to go to can be tricky, but this year’s Isle of Wight festival will take that decision out of your hands. It’s a special one, marking 50 years since its inauguration, and as a result, the festival has been appealing for stories from anyone who was there in 1968, watching Jefferson Airplane and T Rex et al.

Donald Trump believes that the world’s second-largest economy gains an unfair advantage over its main rival due to an overly aggressive and sometimes underhand approach to IP – the patents and copyrights that underpin big tech, manufacturing and creative breakthroughs.So what happens when China plays the game fairly and buys American IP to gain a foothold in the world’s biggest economy? In the case of Lenovo, one of China’s biggest tech firms, doing so has been no guarantee of success. The Beijing-based company has bought three respected US tech businesses since 2005: IBM’s PC arm and low-cost server unit, and Motorola smartphones. None of them has worked out.Far from enabling Lenovo to trample rivals, the phone and server businesses, both acquired in October 2014, for $2.9bn and $2.3bn respectively, have turned into anchors that threaten to pull it down to a loss when it announces full-year results this month.IBM’s sale of its PC ision to a then barely known Chinese company in 2005 raised eyebrows, but it made sense at the time. By 2005 IBM couldn’t make a profit in personal computers, as it was beset by far cheaper rivals. Lenovo could, though, and quickly became a contender for the world’s biggest PC maker, vying with Hewlett-Packard. It looked like the harbinger of a Chinese invasion.While the IBM PC business complemented Lenovo’s existing offerings, Motorola seemed to be the big prize. It sold the world’s first mobile phones in 1983 and in the 2000s the “Hello, Moto” slogan achieved global recognition. Google snapped it up in 2011 for $12.5bn, thwarting Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo’s chief executive. But Motorola didn’t make a profit under Google, which offered it to Yang three years later.That sale of an American icon attracted little regulatory attention. But one American technology executive expressed private outrage at Google’s decision: “it’s an American brand! It’s shameful to sell it like this,” he said.Yang was confident that adding it to Lenovo’s China-based smartphone business would create a global behemoth: the combined company was then behind only Apple and Samsung in the smartphone market. Lenovo’s presentations sounded like a company preparing for war, with phrases such as “protect PC leadership” and “attack mobile internet”.The problem has been a long internal struggle over which brand – Lenovo or Motorola – should drive the business, says Neil Shah at Counterpoint Research. Choosing one brand in territories where they overlapped – China, south-east Asia and India – lost business for the other, but running both meant duplication. He expects the Lenovo brand to be retired in favour of the Motorola one.Asked why the business is not profitable, Lenovo responds that “component costs continue to present challenges” but that it will try to strengthen its position in Latin America and “drive breakthrough in mature markets” along with “controlled investment in emerging markets”.Nor has the server business been a shortcut to success. Since the 2014 takeover it has lost more than $700m. Adrian O’Connell at analysis firm Gartner says the growth of cloud services from Google, Amazon and Microsoft – which allow consumers and companies to store data without the need for their own hardware – threatens all server vendors, because those big providers bypass the profitable support contracts that server companies rely on (often by manufacturing their own equipment).Even the profit engine of the PC business is struggling. Lenovo slipped from first to second place in 2017 as Hewlett-Packard regained its crown, and the PC industry is in a years-long decline, with no clear end in sight. Yang might yet have to swallow a paper loss on those 2014 acquisitions. Of the just over $5bn spent on the Motorola and IBM server businesses in 2014, $2.7bn was allocated to “goodwill” – the part of a company’s value that applies to intangible factors like brand names, customer relationships and patents. In January, a Bloomberg analysis said that Lenovo’s struggles indicated that a goodwill writedown, and potentially a full-year loss, was coming.For Lenovo, the past four years provide a salutary lesson for those seeking a trade war over IP: that even buying patents and copyrights fair and square will not give you a lead in the cut-throat global tech market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67d49e2d0e72b64983770b0ff62ae35becfe2805/60_656_8036_4821/master/8036.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab8b9d16cb73d932dd283d3abac795fd","title":"unseen photographs of civil rights conflict in birmingham alabama 1963","story":"In spring 1963, African American civil rights activists in Alabama started the Birmingham campaign, a series of sit-ins, boycotts and marches against segregation laws.

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, told the House of Commons that the prime minister Theresa May had written to Belhaj and Boudchar to apologise for the “appalling” treatment they had received.After the statement, Straw conceded publicly for the first time that he had authorised some of MI6’s actions, despite previously telling MPs that allegations of his involvement in rendition were conspiracy theories. Rifkind, a former chairman of the ISC who served in various cabinet roles under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, told the BBC: “I think it’s absolutely vital and in the public interest that the role of the prime minister and ministers at the time in this affair should become better understood. “Tony Blair was prime minister. He has been uncharacteristically silent, so far as I am aware not a word has he said. Jack Straw said he would love to give evidence to the ISC on those matters relevant to national security where he can’t speak openly.“What is not known is the extent to which the then prime minister and other ministers were party to what MI6 was doing. And we know that Mr Blair took a very strong personal interest in Libya.”Belhaj and Boudchar fought a protracted legal battle over their claim that they were kidnapped and returned to Gaddafi’s regime in a move linked to Blair’s infamous “deal in the desert” with the Libyan leader. “They could quite easily come to the judgment either that ministers, in their view, did not know, or were not involved, or that ministers were ... right up to their necks, as it were. “There will be no reason of national security why either the involvement of the prime minister, or ministers, or their non-involvement, should not be, not only investigated, but the results announced to parliament and to the wider public.” He added that the committee had the right to decide on its own authority whether to carry out such an investigation. During the 2011 Libyan revolution, documents also came to light revealing MI6’s role in the rendition of a second Libyan opposition figure, Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped along with his wife and four young children. Straw has said he would be happy to give evidence to the ISC, stating that he sought to act at all times in a manner consistent with his legal duties while foreign secretary. But that would be done behind closed doors, and MPs have called for Straw to give evidence before parliament about his role in the kidnap and mistreatment of the two families. Human rights groups, meanwhile, say there needs to be a broader inquiry, independent of government.

Guards and researchers will be withdrawn, and the area shut off.Chinese geologists believe the mountain over the main site was likely to have collapsed after North Korea exploded its largest ever nuclear weapon last year, making it unsafe for further testing and requiring radiation monitoring.But Kim’s move to formally decommission the test site and invite foreign journalists to a highly sensitive military site to observe its shutdown is another gesture of goodwill before the 12 June summit with Trump in Singapore.It comes after Pyongyang government released three American citizens it had been holding. The men, who Trump had described as hostages, were handed over to newly confirmed secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on his second trip to the North Korean capital to prepare for the summit.He described his meetings with Kim as substantive and said he had offered US economic help to North Korea, which is extremely poor, if the country gives up its nuclear weapons.Many long-term analysts are sceptical that Kim, who only announced in December that the country’s nuclear forces were completed, will give up such a hard-won prize even for extremely generous aid.The fate of autocrats like Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up their weapons programmes only to be toppled in western-backed military actions, has been noted in Pyongyang.Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement his predecessor Barack Obama forged with Iran may also give Kim pause for thought about the durability of any deal he makes with a US president.For now, however, Kim appears to be on a diplomatic offensive, offering concessions many thought he would try to use as bargaining chips at the meeting with Trump, including the prisoner release and decommissioning the test site.Foreign journalists will be invited to observe the shutdown of the facility where North Korea has tested several generations of nuclear weapons, “to ensure the transparency of discontinuance of the nuclear test”.“A ceremony for dismantling the nuclear test ground is now scheduled between May 23 and 25, depending on weather condition,” the report said.Correspondents from the United States, Britain, Russia, China and South Korea will be flown in a special charter flight from Beijing to the newly expanded resort town of Wonsan, then take a special train to the remote test site in an “uninhabited deep mountain area” near the northern border. They will sleep and eat on board the train, but a press centre will be set up so they can “transmit … about dismantlement of the test ground which they have covered on the spot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea55484ae896a2fbad9794fab145c5c86f60d34e/0_135_4730_2840/master/4730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2adf3018c138531d6b02c0de23d07d85","title":"ousted malaysian leader najib razak prevented from leaving country","story":"The former PM was not allowed to take a reported flight to Indonesia – and remains in Malaysia where he could face investigation for alleged corruptionThe ousted Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, has been prevented from leaving the country after appearing to attempt to take a flight to Indonesia.The country’s immigration department said in a brief statement on Saturday that Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have “just been blacklisted from leaving the country”.The statement came after a flight schedule had shown that Najib and his wife were due to take a private jet to Jakarta on Saturday morning.But Najib, who faces being investigated by the incoming government for alleged corruption, never appeared and the private jet, owned by Indonesian company Premiair, remained on the tarmac at Subang airport near Kuala Lumpur.Following the announcement of the ban, Najib said he and his family would respect it and stay in the country.“I have been informed that the Malaysian immigration department will not allow my family and me to go overseas,” Najib said in a tweet. “I respect the directive and will remain with my family in the country.”After the reports of his flight emerged on Friday night, dozens of people, accompanied by a large pack of journalists, had descended on the small airport just outside the capital in the early hours to protest his departure. Riot police were stationed outside the gate where people believed Najib would enter.After losing the election this week to the opposition, led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, there had been concerns that Najib would try to flee the country to avoid the chance of prosecution for his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal, which he was accused of covering up while in office. Mahathir has pledged a full independent investigation into the billions of embezzled funds and many believe this will implicate Najib, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing and was previously cleared by the Malaysian attorney general.Mahathir confirmed he had already ordered the 1MDB investigation files to no longer be restricted under the Official Secrets Act. “They will then submit the report to me and I will study it,” he told a press conference on Saturday.Speaking about the re-opened 1MDB investigation Mahathir said: “We want to do it as quickly as possible.” “It is a very complex thing because it involves a lot of people, it involves a lot of decisions made, and the money you know has to be investigated as to the money laundering,” he added. “We have to contact America, Switzerland, Singapore.”By Saturday afternoon, Najib had resigned as the president of his UMNO and as chairman of the Barisan National coalition. “I have a moral responsibility to step down,” he told the party’s Supreme Council. “We all feel sad about what happened but as a party that upholds democratic principles, we accept the people’s decision.”Najib also took to twitter to apologise for his “shortcomings and mistakes”.“After over four decades in politics and the recent election campaign, which was regrettably personal and perhaps the most intense in Malaysian history, I will take a short break to spend time with my family whom I have not seen enough of in recent years,” he wrote.Najib also tweeted that he hoped the “isive period” in the country’s history would end with unity.“I pray that after this isive period, the country will unite. I apologise for any shortcomings and mistakes, and I thank you, the people, for the opportunity to lead our great nation. It has been the honour of my lifetime to serve you and Malaysia.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486846.1525704399!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"overcome by the pong of a pine marten den count yourself lucky","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPine marten: the distinctive smell of its scat is often described as like that of Parma violets. Illustration: Michael VineyA friend who lives on a windy hilltop, in a house nestled in trees, called to tell of a strange smell in her woodshed. There was something, perhaps, going on in one corner, behind a pile of tools. She had glimpsed a furry tail.This is the season when furry animals have babies – and a leafy hilltop adjoining conifer forestry made the pine marten, notorious for siting its nursery in attics and sheds, the likely candidate.A listen at the door was rewarded by sounds of mewing from the corner, as of kittens. The scatter of droppings on the floor matched that of Martes martes, or the Irish cat crainn. We retreated, happy that Ireland’s rarest mammal, long in slow revival after centuries of decline, was staking out a new domain above the western shore.What might have clinched the matter was the distinctive smell of the scat, so often described as like that of Parma violets, even by people without great experience either of the flower or of the scented English sweet of the same name.As a connoisseur of the musky, unmistakable aroma of otter spraint – sampled from the greenest, best-fertilised tufts of grass on stream banks – I was quite looking forward to a new olfactory experience. The overwhelming fragrance of the shed, however, was that of Jeyes Fluid, my friend being one of many householders repelled by the alternative odour, redolent of violets or not.I did not have to go far online, indeed, to find a blog complaining of “having to move downstairs” to escape the pong of a pine-marten den in a roof space. So mixed, indeed, are responses to these intrusions that the Vincent Wildlife Trust has put a special leaflet online: The Pine Marten in Ireland: A Guide for Householders. It could be prudent reading for people now returning to their rural holiday houses.The shortage of natural den sites in Ireland (notably in trees old enough to have big holes) has made houses and sheds attractive to female martens seeking seasonal warmth and safety. They are a long-protected species, and will abandon their kits if disturbed.The two or three young themselves will want to play by night – martens are largely nocturnal. So their noisy skittering on bedroom ceilings can be unwelcome. But from March to July, action to evict a family could bring prosecution under the Wildlife Act.The Vincent trust readily admits that martens “do not make good house guests” and urges proofing the house against invasion. But the animals are superlative climbers and can squeeze through gaps as big as their head (5cm for females).A second leaflet, supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, addresses more of the martens’ misbehaviours. How to eExclude Pine Martens from Game and Poultry Pens describes in detail electric fencing to protect the gun clubs’ pheasant chicks and ways of making a henhouse martenproof.All this may stir questions about what pine martens are “good for” and reinforce the wilder concerns for newborn lambs and babies left out in their prams. The predatory diet of this much-abused native mammal includes neither (except, at times, bits of dead lamb) and embraces even frogs, snails, beetles and blackberries. More helpfully to humans, it is a control on rodent populations and its hunting of rats and mice, bank vole and white-toothed shrew extends even to grey squirrels.This, as recent Irish research has shown, can help restore numbers of the native red squirrel. The red is lighter and more agile, and can retreat to the far ends of branches, while the bigger grey also spends more time on the ground and is easier to catch.This study, carried out in Co Wicklow woods by Dr Emma Sheehy of the University of Aberdeen, found the fur of grey squirrels, but not of reds, in marten scats. It has had wide attention in Britain, where restoration of the marten in Scotland, Wales and northern England and conservation of red squirrels are priorities.In Ireland, meanwhile, the research has been intensive, including genetic study of DNA from marten hairs left in sticky tubes baited with raw chicken. This helped the large-scale assessment of the marten population published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Led by Dr Declan O’Mahony of Northern Ireland’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, the report identified 134 inidual martens at sites spread across the island, with an average low density of about one animal per square kilometre of forest. Combining this with other data, the total population in Ireland was estimated at 3,043. This confirmed the pine marten as a settled and stable resident, but still one of the rarest mammals in Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3492396.1526111519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emma mhic mhath%C3%BAna calls for hse to be dismantled","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma Mhic Mhathúna: ‘Talk to cheap.

Irish support for her “customs partnership” proposal will be forthcoming only if she faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet. Photograph: Tolga Akmentolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects British prime minister Theresa May to push ahead with proposals for a new “customs partnership” which it believes could pave the way for a soft Brexit, and which Dublin will support at next month’s European Union summit.The  understands the British government has told Dublin about the proposals, and the Government is likely to back Ms May at the summit.However, Irish support will be forthcoming only if Ms May faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet and her government shows progress on a common understanding of the border “backstop”, the commitment to maintain an open border even without agreement.Downing Street has told Dublin it has problems with the backstop, but that Ms May’s proposals on a customs partnership would lessen the importance of the arrangement.Government sources agree that the potency of the backstop would be decreased and that it would become “less important” for Ms May if she put forward a customs proposal. It would make it “less offensive” to the DUP, which supports Ms May’s government.While further work would be needed on any customs proposal – even if Ms May gets it through her cabinet – it would “point to a direction of travel” from the UK government of where it wants to go, say sources. It would not be “a solution in itself”.The proposal would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state. The EU has already rejected this model, and a willingness to look afresh – even if it only “provides the basis” for future talks, according to one source – will be seen as a softening of the Irish and EU position. Earlier this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said of Ms May’s customs proposal: “The view of the EU is that it isn’t workable in its current form but it is something that perhaps we could make workable.”The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.However, in tandem with the customs proposal, the British government must “at a minimum” table its own interpretation of the backstop in the weeks before the June summit.It was further argued that the tabling of a customs proposal would make it easier for the backstop to “go green” – be agreed – and this would “leave space for the legal experts” to iron out the details over the summer.In effect, the mooted move would mean the EU taking Ms May’s proposal seriously in order to help her agree to the backstop. Senior Government figures believe the DUP’s priority is now that the North should be treated no differently to the rest of Britain, even if this means staying in a UK-wide customs partnership which would replicate many of the features of the customs union.DUP leader Arlene Foster has said Northern Ireland must move in “lockstep” with the rest of the UK.Although Ms May has said she could not accept the EU’s interpretation of the backstop, the Government is adamant the fallback option must be included in any Brexit deal. “We still need the backstop,” said a senior Government source."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3491993.1526054741!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair crew member broke ankle when pilot reacted to overspeed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTwo cabin crew members on a Ryanair flight fell  and one broke an ankle after the pilot pulled  hard on the  manual controls when it began to “overspeed”.  File photograph: Getty ImagesTwo cabin crew members on a Ryanair flight fell to the floor and one broke an ankle after the pilot pulled too hard on the aircraft’s manual controls when it began to “overspeed” during a descent in a jetstream. The Boeing 737-8AS registered to Ryanair in Dublin was descending into Manchester Airport on the evening of January 14th, 2017, when the incident occurred, according to a report by the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).It said that while descending into a high altitude jetstream, an associated rise in headwind caused the aircraft to overspeed.“The commander disengaged the autopilot and used manual control inputs to stop the speed increasing, but in doing so applied a significant nose-up pitch input on the control column. The resulting manoeuvre caused two cabin crew members to fall, and one of them sustained a broken ankle. The operator (Ryanair) has issued additional guidance to its pilots regarding overspeed recognition and recovery,” the report said. The 31-year-old commander, who had flown 4,997 total flight hours, reported that “because the autopilot appeared not to be correcting the condition, and thinking that he had little time to react, he simultaneously pressed the autopilot disengage button on his control wheel and pulled back on the control column”.“His intention was to avoid the overspeed as smoothly as possible using manual control inputs.”The investigation found there were “marked changes in the normal acceleration of the aircraft over a short period”. Technical data showed that in the one second during which the autopilot was disengaged, the force exerted on the control column by the pilot changed from -0.51 lbs to +42.76 lbs.“The commander reported that he was aware of the possibility of encountering a jetstream in the descent, but had not seen the airspeed increase to this extent before,” the report said. He suspected that a phenomenon known as “startle effect” had caused him to exert more force on the control column than intended. This effect is described as a reflex action elicited by exposure to a “sudden, intense event that violates a pilot’s expectations”. Since the incident, both pilots on the flight had undergone simulator training focused on overspeed recovery, the AAIB said. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, had also indicated it was aware of other similar occurrences.In March 2017, a Boeing 737 encountered an increasing headwind during descent which resulted in indications that the aircraft would overspeed, the report said.The pilot in control responded with a manual control input which caused the autopilot to disengage. Two cabin crew members suffered injuries during the resulting aircraft manoeuvre.The commander on the January 2017 flight told the investigators he had learned from the experience, particularly in relation to the handling sensitivities of the aircraft at high altitudes.In its conclusions, the investigation body said the serious injuries suffered by a cabin crew member occurred “because significant manual control inputs were applied in response to an impending overspeed, which resulted in the aircraft manoeuvring abruptly”.“An increasing headwind associated with a jetstream had caused the airspeed to rise. The narrow speed margins and handling sensitivities of the aircraft at high altitudes were contributory factors.”Boeing said it was considering a revision to the overspeed guidance in the 737 flight crew training manual.

Photograph: Harry MurphySportsfileYoga sessions in Salthill marked the start of Galway city’s Darkness Into Light event early this morning, with an estimated 10,000 people participating in the four kilometre coastal walk.About 5,000 people had registered for the city, but over double that number turned up to offer support to those affected by suicide and to raise awareness about mental health.There had been rumours that one Ed Sheeran might turn up for the run if so, the singer wasn’t among the first finishers who had completed the circuit from Leisureland to the Claddagh and back by 4.30am.Against a steady hum of generators from Pearse Stadium, where the singer is due to perform tonight, early birds were invited to stretch and bend with Yoga Shala tutors in Salthill Park.For some, caffeine was the only answer, and there were steady queues for free coffees offered by Coco Cafe at the start.Some participants wore LED lights, some were still in pyjamas, and some – tucked up in buggies – didn’t really have to wake up at all. Gardaí, Civil Defence, Galway Fire and Ambulance service staff, Pieta House volunteers and members of An Chéad Chath from Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa barracks lined the route, as a long ribbon extended east and as far as bleary eyes could see.Out on the three Aran islands, several hundred walkers carried tea lights along the route — with over 100 turning out on Inis Meáin alone. Sea swimmers were among over 1,000 participants in Kinvara in the south of Galway Bay, with similar numbers in Oranmore and Headford and up to 500 in the town of Clifden."},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme   May 11, 2018Some of Theresa May\u0026rsquos problems stem from her relationship with the DUP "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Pyongyang to take action as part of build up to summit with Donald TrumpLeaked flight manifesto showed Najib Razak was due to leave on a private jet to JakartaCandidate Fidelis Magalh\u0026atildees represents next generation in country still dominated by revolutionary leadersSecurity, neutrality and control of public gatherings drove choice for June 12thNew PM Mahathir Mohamad says king is willing to pardon rival turned allyBodies of three adults and four children found near tourist town of Margaret RiverTeaching English in China can be tricky affair due to unregulated agenciesMahathir, the oldest elected leader in world, ends ruling coalition\u0026rsquos six-decade reignUS president promises \u0026lsquospecial moment for world peace\u0026rsquo when leaders meet on June 12thSome of over 100 protesters in Almaty carried banners saying \u0026lsquoFreedom to political prisoners\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoStop torture\u0026rsquoUS secretary of state returning with \u0026lsquothree wonderful gentlemen\u0026rsquo, says TrumpPM Najib Razak\u0026rsquos party loses seats in key states, raising prospect he could be voted outDual citizens are blocked from national elected office under Australia\u0026rsquos 117-year-old constitutionMeeting signals China\u0026rsquos desire for influence ahead of planned Kim-Trump summitChongqing party boss Sun Zhengcai took millions in bribes, court saysAhsan Iqbal (59) is attacked by a gunman during an election rally in Punjab provincePresident says philosopher\u0026rsquos theory still holds true on 200th anniversaryWorkers have started to restore electricity as homes, crops extensively damaged herds killedLiu Xia despairs as talks to free her from house arrest appear to stallMany of the deceased hit by collapsing walls, trees in north and west of country"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3493361.1526138500!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea to dismantle nuclear test site in may ceremony","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea. File photograph: Airbus Defense \u0026 Space38 NorthPleiades CNESSpot Image via APNorth Korea said it will hold a “ceremony” for the dismantling of its nuclear test site from May 23rd-25th in what would be a dramatic but symbolic event to set up leader Kim Jong-un’s summit with US president Donald Trump next month.North Korea’s foreign ministry said all of the tunnels at the country’s northeastern testing ground would be destroyed by explosion, and that observation and research facilities and ground-based guard units would also be removed.Pyongyang said it planned to invite journalists from the US, South Korea, China, Russia and Britain to inspect the process.Mr Kim had revealed plans to shut down the nuclear test site during his summit with South Korean president Moon Jae-in last month.Following the meeting, Mr Moon’s office said Mr Kim was willing to disclose the process to international experts, but the North’s statement on Saturday did not include any mention about allowing experts on the site.The announcement came days after Washington said that the summit between Mr Kim and Mr Trump would be held on June 12th in Singapore. Seoul, which shuttled between Washington and Pyongyang to set up the Trump-Kim meeting, has said Mr Kim has genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons in return for economic benefits.However, there are lingering doubts about whether Mr Kim would ever agree to fully relinquish the weapons he probably views as his only guarantee of survival.Mr Kim declared his nuclear force as complete in December, following the country’s most powerful nuclear test to date in September and also three flight tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the US mainland.At a ruling party meeting last month, North Korea had already announced that it has suspended all tests of nuclear devices and missiles and the plan to close the nuclear testing ground.North Korea has invited the outside world to witness the dismantling of its nuclear facilities before.In June 2008, international broadcasters were allowed to air the demolishing of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon reactor site, a year after the North reached an agreement with the US and four other nations to disable its nuclear facilities in return for an aid package. – AP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490565.1526048208!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and ireland the border is a sideshow if you re an eel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAttempts to conserve the Irish branch of the European eel have been complicated by BrexitThe autumn spawning migration of the European eel (s. Anguilla anguilla) to the Sargasso Sea is one of the great animal migrations.It is an arduous 6,500km journey from Europe’s inland waterways for the seriously endangered species which is threatened by historic overfishing and the degradation and loss of its habitats due to land reclamation, the construction of dams and reductions in water quality.And now attempts to conserve the Irish branch of the family have been, at the very least, complicated by, of all things, Brexit, their fate tied to the prospects for maintaining a frictionless border between North and South on the Erne river at Ballyshannon.The decline of eel stocks in Lough Erne, where commercial fishing has been halted, has been attributed in part to the attrition of both elvers entering the river from the Atlantic and of developed silver eels descending from Lough Erne through the turbines of the ESB hydroelectric power station.The EU requires member states to develop eel management plans and to take measures to ensure that at least 40 per cent of adult eels can escape from inland waters to the sea where they spawn. On the Erne that has meant the seasonal deployment of lorries with aerated water tanks to transport trapped live eels around the turbines.The protection of the eel is just one of 142 areas of North-South co-operation that are underpinned by joint obligations to EU regulations and to the Belfast Agreement, and which form a key part of the Irish strand of the Brexit discussions.They are a measure of the complex interdependence of both the cross-Border relationship and the scale and scope of the talks process.For the most part there is no question of the UK wishing to repudiate any of programmes that range from environmental projects to cross-Border hospitals, but EU negotiators and their UK counterparts have to work on legal language to copperfasten their post-Brexit future.The eels – provisions for safeguarding the EU’s management plan and regulating the cross-Border transport of live animals – will have their special place in Annex 2.8 of the Irish protocol to the Brexit orce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, currently being discussed by the two sides.Discussions about the controversial Border “backstop” – an agreement would fully align Northern Ireland with the rules of the EU to avoid a hard border – have tended to catch the headlines and eclipse what can seem the more humdrum but nevertheless vital issues.As the protocol makes clear, however, the range and detail of the discussions is huge – as well as ensuring free trade in goods, the protocol says it shall also “be implemented and applied so as to maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South co-operation, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport”.Guaranteeing many of these, Irish officials stress, is also dependent on unhindered movement across the Border – the necessity for a Border deal permeates the entire protocol.It also contains provisions to safeguard the Common Travel Area between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, for joint citizenship provisions for Northern Ireland, and to “respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent”.It requires the UK to guarantee that there is “no diminution of rights” caused by its departure from the EU, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination enshrined in EU law.The Irish protocol currently runs to eight pages of the 129-page Withdrawal Agreement, which is now being turned into legal treaty language.The challenge EU leaders have set themselves is to complete broad agreement on the treaty text by June, so that it can be finalised by October and then be put to member states and the European Parliament for ratification ahead of the UK’s departure at the end of March, 2019.The Withdrawal Agreement contains the agreement on transition, or the “implementation period” as the UK calls it, and, like the rest of the text, it stands or falls on agreement on the whole package, including the Irish protocol.The important parallel discussions now under way on the “future relationship” between the EU and UK, essentially the future trading relationship, are also conditional on no “backsliding” on the agreements made in December in the “Joint Report” between the EU and UK which is reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement.Brussels and Dublin are adamant that unless the UK honours its commitment to the “backstop” provision of that December agreement, the future relationship talks will stop and the Withdrawal Agreement and the transition deal will be put in jeopardy.Those talks are set to produce a political outline of a future trading relationship which will be approved with the Withdrawal Agreement, although not having the same legal standing. A trade treaty can be agreed only once the UK is no longer an EU member-state.The Withdrawal Agreement text is colour-coded to reflect different stages of agreement – currently 15 per cent of the protocol is in green, effectively agreed, 37 per cent remains in yellow, on which there is political agreement on objectives but not on drafting, and 47 per cent is white or uncoloured, unagreed. There is much still to do.Most of the protocol white text reflects how the EU sees the operation of the “backstop” arrangement – the Border fallback guarantee should the UK prove unable to come up with and agree with the EU-preferred scenario for preventing a hard border.The Withdrawal Agreement text on safeguarding human rights post-Brexit remains in yellow – the UK is understood to accept in principle that there should be “no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity” in the North. However, the language proposed by the commission remains problematic, and the full enumeration of such rights in the annex to the treaty protocol has yet to be agreed.The range of these rights goes well beyond the issues of discrimination, equality and identity that are traditionally seen as central to the conflict – gender rights legislation, for example, or carers’ rights, or family law arrangements, including custody and maintenance issues, may have their roots in EU legislation.Although most of such regulations will be incorporated automatically into UK law by means of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, campaigners in the North worry over the abandonment by the UK of obligations under the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.“The EU Charter acts as an important constitutional safeguard underpinning human rights protections in Northern Ireland and its removal weakens the quality and range of human rights protections available here,” the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium warns.The EU’s protocol text proposes that “The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.”Irish officials are said to be concerned at the lack of specific commitments to ringfence such funding.Other non-Border issues such as UK adherence to EU “state aid” rules – to prevent unfair competition through state subsidies – and the challenge of customs-free “transit” for Irish lorries and goods across the UK to EU markets also remain unagreed.Although not mentioned in the Irish protocol, and in theory an issue for the post-Brexit future relationship talks, because it is an issue of specific concern to Ireland and not other member-states, Irish officials are keen to see the issue taken up in the Irish talks strand.The UK signalled as far back as last August that it is willing to sign up to membership of the Common Transit Convention to facilitate the transit trade in both directions, and there are precedents using seals on lorries. But there are concerns at how the Irish lorries will be able to bypass potentially long customs queues at ports such as Dover. Transit across Northern Ireland will also require maintaining harmonised transport regulations such as recognition of hauliers’ licences.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"dup leader insists free flow with the republic possible after brexit","story":"  May 6, 2018Arlene Foster described as \u0026lsquoreal leader of the Conservative Party\u0026rsquo by senior British Labour figure   May 10, 2018Party publicly panicking as UK plan for EU customs partnership falls apart "},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyJake Gyllenhaal and Bradley Cooper go head to head in rival Bernstein films No Ring No Bring?

It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony.

They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleNo Ring No Bring?

The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor it will include two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday.While Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year\u0027s royal nuptials, pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself.Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She said: “The Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion.“I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.”Here is everything you need to know about how the big day will unfold.WATCH:  How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingThe service will take place at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleJake Gyllenhaal and Bradley Cooper go head to head in rival Bernstein films No Ring No Bring?

The Prince and Ms Markle have been striving to make their wedding day personal, with elements of fun and joy mixed in with tradition. Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.Raised in the Civil Rights era, he is a passionate advocate of LGBT rights within the church and has spoken of how his own upbringing, as the descendant of slaves, influenced his commitment to accepting all within the church.As his role at the Royal Wedding was announced, he said: The love that has brought and will bind Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle together has its source and origin in God, and is the key to life and happiness.And so we celebrate and pray for them today.The Episcopal Church is an offshoot of the Church of England in the US and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion worldwide.The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin WelbyMs Markle was baptised by the Most Rev Justin Welby ahead of her wedding to the Prince, whose grandmother, the Queen, is head of the Anglican Church.The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, is to conduct next week\u0027s service, before Archbishop Welby officiates as the couple make their marriage vows.In 2011, the Bishop of London delivered the address at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, speaking of the joy and meaning of marriage in a lively seven-minute sermon. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said of the Prince and Ms Markle\u0027s choice: The couple and the Archbishop discussed a number of possibilities for a preacher.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will marry on May 19Whilst Bishop Curry is not personally known to the couple, it was felt that given the fact that he the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church as well as a wonderful speaker and preacher, it would be highly appropriate for him to be invited to speak.The Archbishop of Canterbury offered his fulsome public support, sharing his thoughts on Twitter to hail Bishop Curry as a brilliant pastor, stunning preacher and someone with a great gift for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.I\u0027m thrilled that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have asked Bishop Michael Curry to preach at their wedding, he said. Marriage is a special and joyous commitment – please join me in praying for God’s blessing for the Royal couple on their wedding day, and for the whole of their lives together.The recommendation from the Archbishop of Canterbury is particularly significant after a near-schism in the Anglican Church around gay marriage, after primates agreed to impose sanctions against the liberal US church.In 2016, an agreement - hailed as partial victory for the Archbishop in that it avoided total ision of the global Anglican communion - saw the Episcopal Church, which accepted gay marriage, banned from key bodies with its views ruled a a fundamental departure from the faith.Bishop Curry was also among members of the church to condemn the America First policies of Donald Trump, with a march on the White House and declaration that we need wise political leadership to deal with the issues of the day.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleNo Ring No Bring?

In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

Scientists want to test how “heavier-than-air vehicles” will operate on the red planet, Nasa said in a release. “The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to Mars.” Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said about the drone-like machine. What fake Mars colony Biosphere 2 looks like today “After the Wright brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate, said at the agency headquarters in Washington.The Mars Helicopter will not be manned but operated autonomously similar to how a drone is here on Earth. It has the potential to be much faster – and more complicated to pull off – than travelling the rocky and dirt-covered surface of Mars. However, unlike a drone “we don’t have a pilot and Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,” MiMi Aung, project manager at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Lab, said. Instead, the helicopter will be able to receive a set of commands for flying a mission and carry them out on its own, Ms Aung explained. Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsOne of the main challenges is that helicopters here on Earth have only reached an altitude of 40,000 feet (12,192 metres), but Mars’s atmosphere is 1 per cent that of Earth’s. This means that when the new helicopter is on the surface of the planet, it will already be the equivalent of 100,000 feet up in the Earth’s atmosphere. “To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinise everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be,” Ms Aung said. Nasa lander to dig into the Mars surface to answer deepest mysteriesNasa and ESA to bring soil from Mars to try and find aliensMission to Mars will launch within a decade, says SpaceX president“Nasa has a proud history of firsts,” Mr Bridenstine said. According to Nasa, “the full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred metres, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds, over a period.

That is precisely what we will do.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Fishing accounts for 41 per cent of the islands’ exports and two-thirds of the corporation tax received by its treasury. UK threatens less EU security cooperation if locked out of GalileoAny negative impact from Brexit on the islands’ economy is likely to be a thorny issue for Brexiteers, for many of whom the Falklands is a touchstone issue.Speaking after recent trips to Brussels and London the chair of the islands’ eight-person legislative assembly told The Independent that potential disruption caused by exit from the single market “would put at risk the current profitability of our fishing industry and would impact both the wider economy and government revenue”.The Falkland Islands government also says “any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economy and people”, according to a report drawn up by the UK Overseas Territories Association.The British government says it has “prioritised securing the freest and most frictionless trade possible with the EU”, although in fact it has pledged to leave the single market and customs union.Any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economyThe islands mostly export loligo squid to Spain, a seafood that accounts for 89 per cent of their exports to the EU. The Falklands provided over a third of the loligo squid imported by Spain last year once it arrives in the port of Vigo it enters the EU supply chain and is distributed around the world.Representatives of the islands’ fishing industry believe that the “worst case scenario” of having to trade on World Trade Organisation rules as advocated by some Brexiteers would cause a £9m hit to revenues because of tariffs – a large sum for the 3,400-population archipelago that would amount to more than £2,600 per person.The islands’ fishing association says cultivating other markets for squid would be “difficult”, especially in Asia, where “demand is highest but competition is strong, and both political and tariff barriers exist”. In the event of a “no deal” Brexit the islanders say they would be left with no choice but to seek support from the British state to prop up their fishing industry.Theresa May has pledged to leave the single market, stating that remaining in it would be incompatible with properly leaving the EU. The British government hopes to secure tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets for fish and seafood through a free trade agreement – but Seafish, a non-departmental public body that supports the British fishing industry, says Brexit has caused “considerable levels of uncertainty” for the sector.While not technically a member of the single market the Falkland Islands currently enjoys preferential access as a result of its status as a self-governing UK overseas territory and Britain’s membership. It pays no tariffs and is exempt from quotas.Teslyn Barkman, one of the eight elected members of the Falkland Islands’ legislative assembly told The Independent: “We have worked hard over many years to establish and grow our fishing industry – it really is a Falkland Islands success story, and one that has allowed us to stand on our own two feet financially.“As a result of our current tariff- and quota-free access to the EU single market, our fishing companies have been able to develop strong markets across Europe for our premium loligo squid, which is our primary export.  Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But I have also said that the virtue, in excess, fills graveyards.“In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering – sacrificing – thousands of skilled and decently paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities.”May has found another way to stall making a decision on BrexitThis is the truth about the politics behind EurovisionWill Sainsbury’s-Asda sell 73 stores or more than 200? We can’t let the Home Office threaten migrants’ right to strikePolice look at evidence Brexit campaign chief committed crimesEarlier this week Mr Corbyn’s office reiterated arguments previously set out by the leader that remaining in the single market as it stands would hamper his interventionist industrial agenda if he won power.In particular, Mr Corbyn has concerns about what he sees as restrictive state aid rules and regulations that might interfere with his plans to reverse the privatization of public services.But Lord Kinnock rubbished the claims as being “based on falsehood”, adding: “Neither the EEA nor the EU are part of the socialist superstate of neocon delusion, or of the global capitalist adventure playground of infantile leftist illusion.“The EEA is a mixed-economy agreement of 31 democracies ‘to promote continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the contracting parties with equal conditions of competition and the respect of the same rules’.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”.Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.Mr Van Gendt presented new figures about the Tesla battery’s performance, which also revealed it has now taken over 55 per cent of FCAS in the region.South Australia is now reportedly the only state that has experienced a decline in FCAS costs in recent months.Some estimates suggest the cost savings to consumers as a result of this decline have been up to A$35m (£19.5m) in the first four months of the Tesla battery’s operation.Lara Olsen, Tesla Energy’s regional manager of business development, also spoke at the event and explained that while other FCAS systems rely on volatile fuel costs, the wind power the battery relies on is fixed at a cheap and stable price.While local politicians in South Australia largely welcomed the giant battery as a key component in efforts to make the state more self-sufficient and provide affordable energy, there has been push back from the higher levels of government.Australian resources minister Matt Canavan even compared it to Kim Kardashian, stating that “it’s famous for being famous. It really doesn’t do very much.”Tesla’s new mega-battery in Australia responding in ‘record’ timeHowever, the success of the project has been recognised by the Australian Energy Market Operator, which has noted that it is capable of responding to outages much faster than conventional generators.South Australia has been hailed for the lead it has taken on renewable energy, with state Labour politicians lending their support to large scale developments including the world’s largest solar thermal plant. The Tesla battery is seen by experts as another jewel in the state’s green energy crown. To some extent the system’s efficiency has not been a positive thing for Tesla, which has stated that the speed of the battery is not being accounted for properly, resulting in the company missing out on payments.Nevertheless, its success has led to interest in further Tesla projects, with a solar-powered version set to be built in the Australian state of Victoria.While the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery currently holds the title of the world’s largest, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently hinted at an even larger project set to be announced soon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a difficult time because that’s when you really feel her absence.”The ex GP and eminent heart doctor husband Gerry, 49, will also pray for their daughters safe return during a low key family “party” at home, along with 13-year-old twins Sean and Amelie.A family pal said: “They’re having a get together with a few friends and family to remember Madeleine on her birthday.It’s a poignant time for the family coming just days after the 11th anniversary but they remain hopeful and vow to never to give up the search.”During the outdoor service in their home village of Rotheley, Leics, Kate read a poem called The Contradiction to remember Maddie with haunting words: “I trace your steps, I map your face. You’re all I know and so unknown. I cannot hold you, yet I do.”Kate, who is now a part time medical worker, still spends precious moments each day in Maddie’s bedroom which she reveals has “shocking pink walls and stars on the ceiling” and where her dolls and teddies are on display, along with an ever growing number of presents.She also told in her mind’s eye how she jumps from seeing her eldest child as she was when she was kidnapped to envisaging her as she would be now.Maddie was kidnapped after being left sleeping alone with her twin siblings at their holiday apartment in the Algarve’s Praia da Luz.At the time her parents were dining with pals at a nearby resort tapas restaurant.She was discovered missing from her bed in the rented flat by her horrified mum shortly after 10pm.Detectives believe she was stolen by child traffickers, sex fiends or during a burglary gone wrong.Scotland Yard are still chasing “a final line of inquiry” and have been given extra £154,000 funding to keep their Operation Grange investigation going until the end of September."},{"url":null,"title":"incredible images reveal life inside moscows gritty underworld where hardcore football fans and bare knuckle boxers rule the streets","story":"These stunning images were snapped by Belgrade-born photographer Boogie ahead of Russia’s first World Cup this summer.Based in New York, the snapper became interested in the darker side of reality when he began documenting the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s.His travels to the Russian capital started in 2015 and show hard-drinking men against the backdrop of Soviet-era brutalist architecture.In one picture, an older lady is shown sporting a huge black eye although it is not clear how she got the injury.Another snap shows a man sitting in the front seat of an Audi car resting a handgun on his denim jeans.Boogie visited a kickboxing club in the city where flat-nosed men of varying ages hone their fighting skills.One picture shows an older man whose torso is covered with a Christian-style tattoo featuring the Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus along with two angels.Another man is shown bare-chested with a skull and dagger inking across his heart.Heavy drinking is still a big problem in the country - with a quarter of Russian men dying before the age of 55.The causes of death include liver disease and alcohol poisoning although many die in accidents or after getting into fights, according to a study by medical journal The Lancet.Russia is also known for its hooligan football gangs some of whom have issued threats to England supporters ahead of the World Cup.Many of the so-called Russian ultras have pledged to “unleash hell” during the football tournament.A group of the ultras are using the Russian social networking site VKontakte to discuss how best to take on other fans.One plan was to lure England fans to Reutov, a small town near Moscow, as it was thought “they would be easier targets to pick out”.In turn, some England fans have also threatened to seek revenge after the bloodshed in Marseille during Euro-2016 when Russia and England fans clashed.England supporters were specifically targeted by hammer and iron bar-wielding Russian hooligans ahead of the countries’ Euro 2016 opener in Marseille last year, which left two men in comas fighting for their lives.Follow this link to check out Boogies website and to find out more about his new book featuring his incredible Moscow photographs.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s so many questions I don’t know the answer to about why we never went on a second date.“But I’m blaming it on the garlic noodles.To this day that’s like an ongoing joke — don’t order the ­garlic noodles that ruined my ­chances!”He made up for it by going on to bed socialite Paris Hilton, whose One Night In Paris sex tape was leaked online.Paris and Simon had an intense three-month relationship and saw each other on and off for four years. Their wild nights together were a world away from Simon’s date with “square” Meghan.Simon Rex, as rapper Dirt, says dates with Paris were a world away from square MeghanIn an exclusive chat from his home in LA, Simon, 43, said: “Meghan seemed well-raised and ­educated, she wasn’t a bad girl. She was kind of a square.“That’s probably why we didn’t hit it off, I’m a little more rough around the edges. When I asked her out again I just got the hint she wasn’t into me. I took it on the chin.”Meghan and Simon met in 2004 when they guest starred on Cuts, a long-forgotten US ­sitcom.Simon’s career was flying high after a role on hit comedy Scary Movie 3.He said: “Maybe that’s why she liked me — I remember her saying she thought it was really funny. It probably helps when you’re on the poster for a big movie and in all the commercials.”They were together for four days of rehearsals before shooting scenes in front of a live studio ­audience on a Friday night at Paramount studios in Hollywood.He said: “We were both new to the show and we were both nervous. You get to know someone pretty quick when you’re sitting round together all day on set.“She was sweet and very polite. She had kind eyes. You could tell she was a nice person.“She would laugh at my corny jokes. I remember flirting with her, cracking jokes and her laughing. My ego loved that, of course.“I don’t believe in love at first sight but I believe in lust at first sight and she was really attractive. She’s a beautiful girl.”By the last day of filming Simon decided he wanted a date and plucked up the courage to ask Meghan out.He said: “I worked up enough nerve to give her my number.“This is pre-smartphones and social media. It might be one of the last times I wrote my number on a napkin.”Meghan quickly got in touch and he asked her out for dinner.The pair went to the Woo Lae Oak, a Korean barbecue restaurant in Beverly Hills. Simon had chopsticks with his name on brought out because he was such a regular there. He ordered a beef dish and another of chicken.He said: “We had a great time. she wouldn’t drink, I had wine but she had water or Coke.“A lot of actresses tend to be divas but she was the opposite. She was sweet to the waiter.“She looked really beautiful. I was like, sign me up, man!”But one of the other dishes Simon ordered was garlic noodles — which proved to be a mistake after he drove her home.He recalls: “We were in the car and as I started kissing her it was obvious that I had garlic breath.“She pulled back. It was so embarrassing.“She said something like, ‘Oh boy, garlic’.“I just felt so dumb. We laughed about it. She wasn’t rude about it or anything. She was honest. She was turned off. It was an awkward moment.”Simon asked Meghan to go to a bar or a club with him after their meal but she declined.He said: “I remember her saying something like, ‘I’ve got to get up early’. She had to work the next day or something.”At the end of their date, crestfallen Simon jumped out of his black Cadillac and opened the door for Meghan to let her out.He hugged her and she went into her home.Simon texted Meghan a couple of days later but admits: “I didn’t get a second date.“I think she even said something along the lines of, ‘We could just be friends’, which was like a dagger to the heart.Meghan — who The Sun revealed used dating guide The Rules to fix her love life — stuck to one of the book’s principles with Simon — “no more than casual kissing on the first date”.Simon said with a laugh: “Looks like she stuck to her rule book. This is all news to me!”The Sun’s revelations about performer Simon’s past date with Meghan have caused a sensation — just a week before she is due to marry Prince Harry at Windsor Castle.A decade before their date Simon had performed a sex act on himself for a porn movie at age 18 after being persuaded to do it by an adult film actress he was dating.To pay his rent, he starred as mystery hunk “Sebastian” in three solo nude sex films which went straight to video. He said: “I never had sex with anybody on camera. It was just me standing there naked.“To me it doesn’t mean s*** but I could see why some people get their feathers ruffled about it, especially the Royal Family.”Simon has had a string of stunning exes including Jaime Pressly from TV’s My Name Is Earl and Twin Peaks’ actress Lara Flynn Boyle.He is also pals with Brit celebrities Calum Best and super producer Mark Ronson. It wasn’t long after his date with Meghan that he started seeing heiress Paris.The blonde reality TV star had shot to fame after footage of her having sex with US poker player Rick Salomon was leaked on the internet. Simon said: “I did a movie, Pledge This with Paris.“Me and Paris were casually dating but it was not like I couldn’t take a girl out on a date, we weren’t exclusive.“This was when she was at the top of her fame. It was like Kim Kardashian. You couldn’t just go to get a drink or dinner because she was swarmed.“It was non-stop. I don’t know how she does it.“It was out of control with Paris, totally exhausting.“It is ironic, as that’s now Meghan Markle’s world.”The comic and rapper — whose hip-hop alter-ego is Dirt Nasty — said he believes he would get on with Prince Harry and was impressed by his naked antics in Las Vegas.He said: “I like the dude — he’s the one royal I like. I swear me and him, under different circumstances, would have a beer and a laugh. I really think that.“You can tell Harry has a sense of humour. He might even be a Dirt Nasty fan, I know he’s in to hip-hop.”Speaking of the upcoming wedding, Simon, who is now in a new relationship, added: “I’ve got nothing but love for both of them.“She made the better move to go with him in the long run. I think she’ll be a great princess.“I hope they have a lot of babies and make America proud. Good on them.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

one of which is given some money.But while the person with the cash is obligated to share some of the loot with other player that portion can be as small as zero.And the Dutch scientists found that small men act more aggressively when there is no threat of repercussions, reports The New Scientist.Experts believe this proves that short man syndrome, also known as Napoleon Complex, is real and factors into the everyday lives of vertically-challenged males.In the study, the 42 volunteers were split into pairs and allowed to meet their partners – who were either little or large depending on their own stature.After allowing the tiny test subjects to see their physically dominant opponents, each player was given a separate room where they were asked to give up some cash.The shortest men in the study, measuring around 5ft7in kept 14 of their 18 tokens to themselves on average while the tall men, measuring about 6ft6in in height, only kept nine of their 18 credits.But when the small gents were faced with the threat of repercussion, they did not display aggressive behaviour and were more willing to share with their opponents.Lead researcher Jill Knapen said: “It’s probably smart for short men to be like this because they have less opportunities to get resources.Short blokes on average are less wealthy, less successful and less healthy than their taller counterparts, according to studies.Bigger men also enjoy better sex and love lives than small guys.Little men may also have to adopt a more defensive stance because of aggression from their larger peers.Mike Eslea at the University of Central Lancashire is sceptical about whether the type of behaviour displayed by small males can be explained by the Napoleon Complex.Speaking to New Scientist, he said: “They’re supposed to be publicly advertising their aggressiveness to compensate for their lack of stature.“To me this doesn’t suggest the Napoleon Complex exactly, it suggests something else.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405240436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"newlywed couple china honeymoon preston","story":"Legend Liang, 33 and his new wife Carmen, travelled 6,000 miles to spend their holiday not on a sandy beach under a palm tree but in the Lancashire city.He whisked Carmen from their home and spent three days in the town - even posing for photographs in their wedding attires at various landmarks.The couple proudly posed outside the citys Fishergate shopping centre, a university campus, outside a bus-stop, the Media factory building and in a park.Journalist Legend choose the former cotton mill town as he had studied there at the University of Central Lancashire campus ten years ago.He was keen to show Carmen some of his old haunts during a two week honeymoon in the UK during which they also visited Brighton and London.Legend, who studied international journalism for a year at the uni in 2008, decided no other place was going to bring the wow-factor than Preston.Legend, from Guandong in southern China, said: Preston is a very important place for me.I wanted to show my wife where I studied, where I lived in Whitendale Halls and on Fishergate, and how lucky I was to have the opportunity to live in a lovely small city which had an international perspective.It had been 10 years since the uni grad had stepped foot in the city famed for its 94 metre spire at St Walburges Church - which is the tallest in Britain.But Legend was amazed at the difference a decade made - with the campus now including its Xbox building - a green, grey and black-coloured media centre.He added: The Media Factory was a building site so its nice to see that looking so good, Fylde Building has gone and theres others being built while in the city centre the market has changed so much.The pair spent the last two weeks also visiting London, Brighton and Edinburgh as they flew back home to their native China on Thursday.Legend, a Guangzhou Yangcheng Evening News reporter, said his wife had enjoyed her trip to Preston as much as him - proving the 14 hour flight was worth it.He said: She thought London was a huge city, just like we have back home but Preston was really nice because she could see how UK people live and work in a small city with everything they need being close by.Legend studied at Guangdong University of Foreign Study, an international partner of UCLan since 1986, for two years before his move to Preston.He was taught in his home country by Matt Horn - the course leader of the international journalism franchise programme since it began in 2005.Matt said: Legend always showed the natural instincts required of a good journalist and is well respected in the city.UCLan and GDUFS have a long and happy history together and so I was delighted when Legend introduced his bride to be as I had taught her for GDUFS a couple of years after I was Legends teacher.Preston is famous as the location for the opening of the first KFC in the UK in 1965 and as the home of Preston North End FC."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000395754020.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rubbish fly tipped england stretch 1600 miles moscow","story":"The bill for taxpayers rocketed 13 per cent last year, councils said.They revealed that in 2016/17 there were 492,139 cases where waste the size of a small van or tipper truck was illegally dumped.Put together the vehicles would form a 1,459-mile queue, with the amount of fly-tipped rubbish circling the M25 12 times.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which they are.The Sun is all for more grammar ­places so long as a generous proportion are guaranteed for children from low-income families — as they will be.We back more choice, smaller classes and higher standards. So does the nation.DONALD Trump has been given the usual kicking over Iran — but he may be right.Barack Obama’s dodgy deal freed the mullahs to spend billions spreading war and terrorism throughout Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.Trump aims to halt that and punish the extremist regime. Who knows . . . maybe Iran’s people will finally revolt.Trump’s aggression and rash tweets have surprising upsides. He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise. A rabidly left-wing UN “racism inspector” sent to “find out” if Britain is more racist since the Brexit vote has decided — wait for it — we ARE!Her bogus “report” is a load of pre-meditated and vacuous bilge designed to bash ­Britain and the Leave vote.It must have irritated Tendayi Achiume to have to leave her home in the Californian sunshine for the charade of a 12-day UK tour amassing “evidence”.Here’s an idea, though.

The shocked OAP, unsure what to do with the pony, contacted World Horse Welfare who got in touch with the RSPCA.The animal charity today released pictures of the pony stranded in the small yard of the house surrounded by wheelie-bins, garden furniture and a rabbit hutch.RSPCA inspector Charlotte Melvin, who attended the property to check over the horse, said: You couldnt make this up.A 13-year-old girl responded to a plea on an online free ads site where a lady said she didnt want the pony anymore and that he would be put to sleep if no one had him.She gave her nans address and the next thing that happened was a man just came along and dumped the pony there, no words of advice or anything like that - and leaving a very shocked nan.We dont know where this poor pony came from but he clearly was not treated well before being abandoned.We have come to a dead end in trying to find out further information so we are appealing for anybody who can help us to get in touch.The pony, who has been named Mr Melvin Andrews, is now in the care of World Horse Welfare.Field officer Rachel Andrews who transported the animal to a private boarding establishment, said she hoped the incident was not the start of a new trend.She added: Were seeing sick or young ponies being dumped and abandoned when their owners no longer want them, and it would be a worry if online free ad sites are used in this way.Many provide advice on the commitment required to take on a horse.Every horse and pony deserves responsible ownership, which includes responsible breeding, selling and rehoming.Were just glad that Melvin the pony has settled in well at our Penny Farm Rescue and Rehoming Centre and has already shown himself to be lovely a little pony and we hope in time we can find him a good home.Anyone who has any information is asked to call the RSPCAs appeals line on 0300 123 8018 or World Horse Welfare at 08000 480 180.Last month, the RSPCA revealed that the number of horses rescued by the charity has reached a four-year high, as the equine crisis continues to have devastating consequences.The charitys annual Cruelty Statistics revealed that nearly 1,000 horses were rescued by the charity from cruelty, suffering and neglect last year (2017), and a staggering 928 horses are currently in the charitys care."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004034380181-e1525959399883.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"neil kinnock accuses labour leader of jeremy corbyn serious evasion of duty over brexit single market stance","story":"The former Labour leader, who led the party from 1983 to 1992, said Corbyns stance on the single market could lead to the rockslide of hard Brexit.He also said that arguments against the single market formed part of an infantile leftist illusion in an interview with The Independent.Mr Kinnock added: It would be a serious evasion of duty if Labour did not seize this chance to protect our country from the rockslide of hard Brexit.By supporting continued (European Economic Area) participation we can end the prime ministers deference to the cliff-edge kamikaze squad and force her, or her successor, into the pragmatic patriotism of putting country before party.He added: I respect our Labour leadership in the Lords and I value loyalty.

In Labour strongholds, you\u0027d be hard pressed to find any.But after the PM lost her Commons majority in last year\u0027s general election, she doesn\u0027t have the votes in the Commons for a widespread expansion of the grammar school system.So she\u0027s now attempting to boost the ones that are there already, with a \u0026#16350m fund to create thousands of extra places, many for pupils from poorer backgrounds.She has found a willing accomplice in Damian Hinds, a grammar school boy from Altrincham in Manchester\u0027s leafier suburbs, who was promoted to Education Secretary in the January reshuffle.His two predecessors in the job, Justine Greening and Nicky Morgan, both of whom were sacked by Mrs May, didn\u0027t care for grammar schools at all.Ms Greening, who last week urged employers to discriminate against applicants from Eton, is a steelworker\u0027s daughter from Rotherham who went to the town\u0027s Oakwood Comprehensive School.As the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran put it, rather colourfully: \"We now know what we suspected. Justine Greening was moved on to make way for a lap dog for Theresa May\u0027s pet projects.\"So why the PM\u0027s enthusiasm for grammars? She and other supporters claim they\u0027re good for social mobility. Opponents say they do the exact opposite.After all, a grammar school in every town suggests a secondary modern in every town too. But you won\u0027t find many Tory MPs who support grammar schools backing a return of secondary moderns for children who fail the 11-plus.Ah yes, Tory MPs! Looking at the politics of all this, surely a big motive for the PM in the Government\u0027s \u0026#16350m handout to grammar schools is pleasing Conservative backbenchers. or at least those on the Tory Right.That\u0027s because Conservative MPs who love grammar schools are largely the same ones who hate the European Union.They\u0027re also the same MPs who are currently holding the PM to ransom on Brexit and threatening to topple her if she caves in to Remainers. So cynics will regard the latest boost for grammar schools as a sop to the Tory Right, a bone tossed in their direction in the increasingly bitter Brexit dogfight - even if the Prime Minister does indeed appear to have an obsession with grammar schools.According to political journalist Rosa Prince\u0027s biography of Theresa May, The Enigmatic Prime Minister, it was at school that she became interested in politics.By the time she was in the sixth form she was apparently confident enough to announce that she intended to become Britain\u0027s first woman Prime Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"tens thousands people take part","story":"News\"It\u0027s time for a shift of power\": Jeremy Corbyn pledges new deal for workers as protesters march for end to Tory cuts and “poverty” payPublic sector workers, pensioners, students, families with children in pushchairs and people with disabilities were among more than 25,000 protesters who marched through central London\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByStephen Hayward16:31, 12 MAY 2018Updated16:52, 12 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn told tens of thousands of protesters today it was time for “a fundamental shift of power” in Britain. Public sector workers, pensioners, students, families with children in pushchairs and people with disabilities were among more than 25,000 protesters who marched through central London calling for an end to Tory spending cuts and “poverty” pay. Waving placards and blowing whistles, they packed the streets and brought parts of the capital to a standstill at the TUC’s A New Deal for Working People demonstration. Addressing the rain soaked crowds in London’s Hyde Park, Mr Corbyn said: “Our whole movement exists to challenge the powerful and stand up for the powerless. That’s why in government, we will give workers and employees more power at work, by strengthening their rights and freedoms to organise together to improve their lives.”  To huge cheers, he promised a future Labour government would launch a massive house building programme and bring the railways, Royal Mail and water firms back into public ownership. He also said workers would get a greater say in the running of their firms and promised to stand up for exploited workers against fatcat bosses and to clamp down on tax dodging corporations. More than 120 coaches were hired by TUC organisers to bring protesters to the capital while unions block booked tickets on trains. Victoria Embankment, where the mass rally began at midday, was turned into a sea of giant balloons and banners with union messages demanding: “No more cuts, no more austerity” and “\u0026pound10 minimum wage now”.  Trade unionists chanting “Tories out” called for a new \u0026pound10 an hour minimum wage, a ban on zero hours contracts and better funding for public services. They included workers involved in current disputes at restaurant chains TGI Fridays and McDonalds. The TUC says real wages are worth \u0026pound24 a week less than before the 2008 credit crunch while nearly four million workers are stuck on zero hours contracts, agency work and low paid self employment. Public servants have had to put up with low or non existent pay rises for eight years. And years of Tory cuts have led to poverty, homelessness and despair for many, say unions. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis, addressing the rally, said it was time for an end to cuts, and the “greed and hate” that defined Theresa May’s government.  He said: “Most public service workers - the cooks, the cleaners, the carers, many of them women - earn less in a year than some people in this country make in a day. “It’s ordinary people who are suffering. The survivors of the Grenfell tragedy are still homeless a year on. “The Windrush generation have been denied the care they need and told to go home by a callous government. Ministers said they wanted a hostile environment - so let’s create one for them, the Prime Minister and the politics of austerity.” TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady - whose organisation celebrates its 150th anniversary this year - said the “massive turnout” sent out a strong message to the Government. She said: “UK workers are suffering the worst pay squeeze for two centuries. This means families are struggling to get by. Millions of kids are growing up in poverty despite having parents in work. “The success of this country depends on workers’ labour. The people who build cars, mend our roads, drive the trains, teach our children and tend the sick.”  Dave Ward of the Communication Workers Union added: “This is the start of a serious challenge for a new deal for workers.” Mother of two and shopworkers union shop steward Vanessa Kirk, 53, of Basingstoke, Hants, earns \u0026pound8.75 an hour as Co-op convenience store worker. She wants the Government to bring in a \u0026pound10 an hour minimum wage. She said: “There are no set shift patterns and it’s hard to get to concurrent days off. You get more and more put on you for no extra pay. I used to be happy but the pressure they put on you the less you enjoy it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ambulance worker hung up seriously","story":"NewsAmbulance worker HUNG UP on seriously ill man - who died 17 hours after making desperate final 999 callThe family of landscaper Ronald Russell have released a transcript of the call that was eventually terminated by a call handler at the Scottish Ambulance Service\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy SamsonNeil Murphy02:54, 12 MAY 2018Updated09:40, 12 MAY 2018News (Image: SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 999 worker HUNG UP on a seriously ill man - who tragically died just hours after he made the desperate final call for help. Ronald Russell, 49, passed away at his home in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, on July 4 last year. His family say that the landscape gardener lived alone and suffered from mental health issues. A transcript of the call was released by relatives of Mr Russell and reveals how his pleas for help went ignored by staff from the Scottish Ambulance Service. Medics finally arrived at his address 17 hours after the call – and only after a concerned neighbour contacted them.  According to the transcript, Mr Russell made the call from his mobile at 5.45pm on July 4, 2017 and requested an ambulance to bring him to hosptial. The call handler repeatedly asks “What’s the telephone number you’re calling from please?” despite being aware that the phone number was being displayed from their terminal. Mr Russell replied: Can you hold on until I get that? The call handler says Sorry? and he continues: “I’ve got this, I’ve I’ve got this, got it written down.”  The caller was heard moaning loudly throughout the call and his response is recorded as Ooooooh ohhh (incomprehensible sound from caller).” The call handler once again asks if he wanted an ambulance, ignoring his previous requests. Finally, after saying “hello?” five times without a reply, the call handler hangs up. In all, the conversation lasted three minutes.  The Ambulance Service rang his number three times to get Mr Russell back on the line but did not try to trace his address. They have admitted more should have been done to track Mr Russell’s whereabouts.  A Scottish Ambulance Service report said: “It is evident on listening to the call that the call handler can hear noises and moaning. The correct process was followed by providing three calls back, however, due to the call handler knowing that the caller was on the line before it disconnects, there could have been more attempts to confirm the address - or for this to be highlighted to a supervisor.” Ronald’s sister Margo Cassidy, 52, said: “It was really devastating to read that, especially because I think most people imagine that when you phone an ambulance the first thing they will ask is, “Where are you?” “We knew he had phoned an ambulance because we had his mobile.

She told  the man, wearing a red tracksuit, had been sitting at the back of the First UK vehicle when she got on, but moved forward as people started to get off. She realised something was wrong when she saw his reflection in the window. Karlah said: He came and sat opposite me on the bus.

Firefighters raced to the family’s flat in Bournemouth when flames became visible from the property.  Residents of the block were evacuated as emergency crews from three fire stations battled the blaze. No-one was injured but the source of the fire is believed to be a cheap phone charger, which was plugged in at the time.  Mother Donna Burton was settling down with her three children, aged 11, 12 and 18 to watch Britain\u0027s Got Talent on Monday evening when she noticed the smell of burning coming from one son\u0027s beds. Upon further inspection she noticed the charger had become so hot that a hole had been burnt into the duvet cover. She quickly unplugged the charger and returned to the living room but the family then spotted a \u0027bright orange glow\u0027 and realised the room was on fire. Donna said: My son was charging his phone with a USB charger from a discount shop.  He\u0027d plugged it in and then put his phone on the bed. We were watching Britain\u0027s Got Talent together and then I noticed a smell of smouldering. The charger had become so hot it had burned a hole through the duvet cover. It wasn\u0027t an electrical problem - it was the charger. I wanted to warn people that this could happen to them. It could have been ten times worse.

The clip shows the Israel Defence Force (IDF) weapon bearing down on the aerial interception system in Syria as soldiers stood just yards away. Israel fired the missile in retaliation after Iran shelled Golan Heights in a strike on Thursday. The Syrian Army Command said three people had been killed and two injured, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 military personnel had died. In the aftermath of the Iranian attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tehran had crossed a red line.  It was the firs time Iran fired rockets in a direct attack on Israeli targets. It prompted Israel to launch a widescale strike on Iran\u0027s military targets in Syria in its heaviest barrage in the country since 2011. Iranian troops have joined allied Shi\u0027ite Muslim militias and Russia in supporting under-fire Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Netanyahu said: The international community must prevent the entrenchment of Iran\u0027s Quds force in Syria.  We must unite so that we may sever the spreading limbs of its evil there and in every place. I repeat: whoever hits us, we will hit back seven-fold and whoever prepares to strike at us, we will act to strike at them beforehand. This is what we have done and this is what we will continue to do.

William Dorey, 18, is seen happily running across the coast just minutes before reckless Joshua Cherukara and Harry Cable began zooming down Whitley Bay. Cherukara was driving a Renault Megane when it lost control and mounted the pavement, crashing straight into William and left him with catastrophic injuries. Footage shared by Northumbria Police officers shows that, in the moments before the crash on May 7 last year.  CCTV captures the moment, at around 10pm, that Cherukara lost control of his vehicle and collided with Willliam Dorey.  His friend, Harry Cable, who passed his driving test just days before the crash, was in a Vauxhall Corsa.   After the collision Cherukara told a friend “I think I’ve killed him”, according to Chronicle Live.  In an emotional statement from William Dorey’s family, they called for the parents of young men to “guide them to think about the catastrophic consequences of driving in an unsafe and dangerous manner as Cherukara and Cable chose to do on 7 May last year.” The statement added: “There can surely be few things more painful to endure than the loss of a young life, especially in such wholly avoidable circumstances. “Constantly and forever in our thoughts and hearts, Will was, and would have continued to be, a wonderful and precious son and brother.  “Knowing that we will never see him again is very hard. Our grief and profound sense of loss still overwhelms us. “We now have to live with the consequences of this accident, which has been a tragedy for all concerned. Lives have been ruined, changed forever. “It is another horrific reminder of the utter devastation that can strike without warning when, through selfish, arrogant and unthinking behaviour, people act with so little care and regard for the lives of others.” “For their tremendous dedication, professionalism and sheer hard work throughout the course of their investigations we thank and pay tribute to Northumbria Police.   Northumbria Police have released the footage as the joyriders were jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for more than 11 years in total. Both men admitted death by dangerous driving.  Sergeant Lee Butler, of the Force’s Motor Patrols Department, said: “This is a devastating case which shows what can happen when people take for granted the damage a vehicle can do. “The two defendants in this case spend the evening of May 7 racing along the coast and were caught on CCTV driving at high speed. “Eventually Cherukara lost control of his vehicle, mounted the pavement and collided with William Dorey who was jogging on the roadside.

There is believed to have been an ambush against tourists.  Park ranger Rachel Katumwa, 25, was shot dead while trying to save the couple from being kidnapped, a devoted conservationist who died in the line of duty. She became the first female ranger in the bloody history of the park to be murdered by bandits.  These images were taken just a few miles from the village of Kibumba, where the attack took place on Friday morning. Photographer Bella Falk, 39, captured the images on a trip to the area just last month.  Last month five rangers and a driver were also killed in the park. A spokesperson for the Foreign \u0026amp Commonwealth Office said: We are in close contact with the authorities in Democratic Republic of the Congo following an incident involving two British nationals, and our staff are providing support to their families.

We were accompanied at all times and told not to take photos in the streets of Goma hence why my photos are all from a distance, they were all taken from the safety of the car.

Luke Hicks burned two vibrators - worth \u0026pound66 - in anger because Danielle Gillies was away on a women-only night out. A court heard the 24-year-old found the two sex toys in a bedroom in a chest of drawers and set them alight in his rage. Hicks had downed 15 pints of lager as well as vodka and champagne during an all day drinking session at horse racing before heading to his girlfriend\u0027s flat. And he started a vibrator bonfire in fury at realising Danielle, 23, had gone out was out with the girls. His outraged girlfriend came home from the Cardiff night out to find the sex toys destroyed as well as fire damage to a cupboard.  Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard-Jones said Ms Gillies dumped Hicks straight away and he spent the next nine days begging her to get back with him. But many of Hicks\u0027 messages turned abusive and he was charged with harassment. Mr Pritchard-Jones said: He let himself into the flat and burned two sex toys that she had in the bedroom, and made a small burn mark on the chest of drawers. He sent her a constant stream of texts over the next nine days. Some were abusive, but mainly they were trying to persuade her to get back with him.” Hicks was warned any further contact would be considered harassment, but Haverfordwest Magistrates heard he continued to message Ms Gillies anyway.  Insurance worker Hicks, of Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire, admitted criminal damage and harassment. Mike Kelleher, defending, said Hicks was extremely drunk when he entered the woman\u0027s flat. He added: “He had not expected his girlfriend to go out as well. He let himself into her property and found that she was not there. He had drunk far too much than was good for him. Mr Kelleher said Hicks continued to message the woman because she hadn\u0027t blocked his number. In his eyes, because he had not been blocked, he saw a glimmer of hope, he said. He accepts that the relationship is over. The texts were born out of a sense of frustration, which grew and grew.

The US-owned giant has cut the contents of favourites including Belgian chocolate, vanilla and coffee from 500ml to 460ml. But despite the eight per cent reduction, the tubs will still cost \u0026shyfamilies the same at \u0026pound5.35. It is the latest example of “shrinkflation”, where manufacturers quietly downsize products without cutting prices. Haagen-Dazs blamed rising costs and insisted it had taken the step \u0026shy“absolutely as a last resort”. But consumer champ-ions are not impressed, seeing shrinkflation as merely a sneaky way of raising prices.   Alex Neill, of watchdog Which?, said: “Time and again we’ve seen popular products shrinking while the price stays the same, and this latest example will leave ice cream lovers feeling cold. Manufacturers and retailers should be up front about any changes to their \u0026shyproducts so customers can make an informed choice about how to spend their cash.”  We revealed two years ago how \u0026shyvarieties of the nation’s biggest-selling ice cream brand, Magnum, had shrunk in size by as much as 13.6 per cent while staying the same price. Britain’s ice cream industry, which is worth more than \u0026pound1billion a year, has blamed the downsizing on the rising cost of vanilla and other ingredients. Around 85 per cent of the world’s supply of vanilla pods comes from \u0026shyMadagascar, where a cyclone and \u0026shypolitical unrest have sent prices sky high.

She will place them, along with cards and messages of support, in Maddie\u0027s pretty pink bedroom which has become a shrine to her and remains unchanged since she vanished during a family holiday in Portugal 11 years ago.  Maddie’s great uncle Brian Kennedy said: “It would be lovely to have a celebration one day. We never lose hope.”   Kate, 50, previously said: “I do all the present buying. I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”  She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a difficult time because that’s when you really feel her absence.”  The ex GP and heart doctor husband Gerry, 49, will also pray for their daughter\u0027s safe return during a low key family “party” at home.

During the outdoor service Kate read a poem called The Contradiction to remember Maddie with haunting words: “I trace your steps, I map your face. You’re all I know and so unknown. I cannot hold you, yet I do.”  The couple cling onto a glimmer of hope that their daughter - who was snatched as a three-year-old - could still be alive and told in an anniversary message on the Find Maddie website that the continuing support from family, friends and well wishers was “a real tonic and boost to our spirit.”  They stated: “She is a real person and still our ‘little girl’ and as we always have we will endeavour to do whatever it takes to find her. “Hope and perseverance remain.

At first, Jo Naylor told her sporty daughter Amelia, 10, to ‘stop being silly’ when she fell on the grass after crossing the finish line following the 2km run. But when she saw her daughter’s eyes roll back in her head and noticed that she was not breathing, the nurse and mum-of-two quickly went into first aid mode. Mrs Naylor said that it had just been a normal day before the terrifying incident at Swithland St Leonard’s CofE School in Loughborough. “I thought she was a bit slow, I seem to remember shouting ‘pick up your pace,’” she said.  During the race, Amelia, who was house captain of the running team, had slowed down to help a friend who was struggling. But after she crossed the finish line, it was Amelia who suddenly needed urgent, life-saving help. “She lay down on the grass and said, ‘Oh mummy I can’t breathe.’ “She became unresponsive. Her eyes were rolling back and she wasn’t answering me. It was clear she was not messing around,” Mrs Naylor said. She called for an ambulance and then realised that her daughter was not breathing. With tears in her eyes recounting the incident, Jo continued: “I laid her on her back, lifted her chin and double checked to see if she was breathing then, but she definitely was not.  “I gave her mouth to mouth, and she didn’t respond. So I checked for a pulse, I could not feel one so I started chest compressions. After one minute I thought she’d sit up,” Mrs Naylor said. But when her young daughter remained slumped and unresponsive, the nurse knew she was in cardiac arrest. In a cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, quickly starving the brain of oxygen and causing the patient to fall unconscious and stop breathing. Without CPR or urgent medical attention, a cardiac arrest quickly proves fatal. So Mrs Naylor gave her daughter chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth for 20 long minutes which kept her oxygenated and alive while they waited for help.  When the ambulance arrived, paramedics grabbed a defibrillator to shock her heart in the hope that it would reestablish Amelia’s normal rhythm. “The ambulance guy gave her a single shock. Her heartbeat stopped. And then it restarted. It was so exciting,” Mrs Naylor said through tears of emotion. Amelia was rushed to hospital where surgeons discovered that her left coronary artery was connected in the wrong place. She was operated on at Glenfield hospital in Leicester where doctors corrected the faulty connection, and Amelia, who collapsed on September 13 last year, was well enough to return to school last November. But Mrs Naylor knows that without the bystander CPR her daughter received, she would have died before the ambulance arrived that day. She said that CPR is a simple but life-saving skill that everyone can and should learn and she has shared her story ahead of the fifth annual Restart a Heart Day on October 16 which aims to teach a record-breaking 200,000 people life saving skills. Mrs Naylor said: “Doing something is better than doing nothing. I remember as a student nurse saying ‘you can’t get any deader than dead.’  “If someone has collapsed and their heart has stopped you cannot do any harm but you can help. “Simple skills save lives. Everybody in the family now knows how to do CPR. Everyone in the whole world should know how to do it. You never know when you’re going to need it. If you give it a try you might just save a life. Every year, there are more than 30,000 cardiac arrests outside of hospitals in the UK and less than 10% of these people will survive. But if CPR is started early, it can double a person’s chance of survival. The Restart a Heart campaign, led by Resuscitation Council (UK), St John Ambulance, and other organisations aims to improve these shockingly low survival rates. On Tuesday 16 October, organisations all over the world will join forces to increase public awareness of cardiac arrests and increase the number of people trained in CPR. Events will be hosted in schools, community centres, hospitals and emergency service stations to train people in essential life saving skills.

Jordan Lynam\u0027s little balloon bears the slogan It\u0027s a Boy and is part of an ornament covered with photos of Jordan as a newborn.  His aunt gave his mum Natalie Clarke the gift back in 1992 — and the balloon has refused to burst or deflate since, Birmingham Live reports.  Hot cigarette ash has been dropped on the blue balloon, it has been squeezed into house removal boxes and spent years in attics for more than two decades.  But Jordan, a singer and rapper, is delighted it hasn\u0027t popped.  Now, he is going to contact Guinness World Records about what he reckons is the oldest balloon in the world.  It\u0027s a God-given gift, Jordan, from Castle Vale, Birmingham, said. “It is still full of life and full to the brim with gas. It’s only a small balloon, about the size of a tennis ball, but it was that size when it was bought. “We have had three house removals and it has been stuck in the loft for years. Cigarette ends have been dropped on it, yet it’s still here – and I think that’s a record. I’ve read about a woman with an old balloon, but I’ve got a year on her.  There were actually two balloons bought when Jordan was born. The other one lasted years, but eventually proved a let-down. I’m scared to death of someone treading on it. I’m a nervous wreck when someone lights a cigarette, Jordan continued.

The world\u0027s most recognisable scientist died in March aged 76, after spending his career probing some of the universe\u0027s biggest mysteries. He was particularly interested in time travel and in tribute to that, his family are inviting people who claim they are from the future to celebrate his life with them. People can apply for tickets for the event in Westminster Abbey - but must include their correct date of birth on the form.  This can be any day up until the end of 2038. The option to have a date of birth in the future was spotted by London blogger ianvisits who wrote on his site: Professor Hawking once threw a party for time travellers, to see if any would turn up if he posted the invite after the party. None did, but it seems perfect that the memorial website allows people born in the future to attend the service. Look out for time travellers at the Abbey.  The ceremony will be held on June 15 and his ashes will be interred alongside the graves of Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. Hawking suffered from rare-early onset slow progressing form of motor neurone disease, which parlayed him and left him unable to speak.

Police were sent around to fit Rich Walklate’s home in Cheltenham last week after worried friends reported him missing from running.  The local parkrun co-founder was found at home, with investigations into his death now revealing he died of natural causes - despite his young age, Gloucestershire Live reports .  The IT worker’s family said “our lives have been totally devastated”, but they have been “overwhelmed” by the support that has flooded in from his friends.  They added: “We knew that Rich had numerous qualities and had achieved a great deal in all aspects of his life – but we had no idea of the extent of the affection and respect in which he was held. “He gave very little away and told us relatively little of life away from home. He was immensely tough.” Mr Walklate, originally from Southampton, was born with a heart condition and underwent two major heart valve operations within three days in 2014. But he was “determined to get himself back to full fitness”, his family said, and he completed the highest marathon in the world, the Everest Marathon, last November. Mr Walklate, who co-founded Cheltenham parkrun five years ago, achieved a personal best time of three hours and three minutes in last month’s Manchester Marathon. Relatives Steve, Jane, Rachel and Anna said: “We are obviously proud of these achievements, but, of more significance, is our pride in the way he conducted himself. “In his humble and unassuming way, he cared for and encouraged other people and he would never let anyone down.” Addressing those who have paid tribute, they added: “You have helped us so much at such an impossibly difficult time. “He has died far too young, but he has made the most of such a ridiculously short life.” Mr Walklate was a member of the Almost Athletes running group and Cheltenham Triathlon Club. He competed in Iron Man events, which involve a 112-mile bike ride, full marathon and two-and-a-half-mile open water swim. His best time was in Zurich, where he completed the feat in under 11 hours. Runners will honour Mr Walklate by wearing baseball caps at Cheltenham parkrun, in Pittville Park, starting at 9am tomorrow. “We have decided that we will all be wearing caps on Saturday as we never saw Rich run without one,” Cheltenham parkrun said in a statement. “It\u0027s just a small token of our love for him, and we would welcome anyone who knew him to do the same.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather another mini heatwave","story":"NewsUK weather: Another mini-heatwave is on the way - and the hottest areas may surprise youForecasters are keeping watch of a ridge of high pressure on course to skirt the British Isles and lure warm and sunny weather back towards the country\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte Smith20:29, 11 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrits look set to bask in summer-like weather once again early next week as above average temperatures return to the UK. Forecasters are keeping watch of a ridge of high pressure on course to skirt the British Isles and lure warm and sunny weather back towards the country. Values are expected to rise up to 4-8C above normal for the time of year on Monday and Tuesday as warm air from the south dislodges the current cool and unsettled westerly airflow. Some computer models are indicating highs could reach close to 20C in north-east England by Tuesday, and up to 15-19C elsewhere. The best of the weather will be in central and north-east England where high pressure will supply a brief window of sunshine and high temperatures.  However, scattered showers are still likely in the south and west on Monday, followed by further outbreaks on Tuesday - although these will be largely confined to north-east Scotland. The balmy outlook comes after forecasts of heavy rain and thunder in parts of the west this weekend as a series of lows from the Atlantic take charge. Temperatures will also dip below average in places over the two days, with risk of frost in Northern Ireland and Wales, before rising sharply from Monday.  Katie Greening, forecaster of The Weather Channel , said the mercury will spike early next week after a bout of cool and unsettled weather over the weekend.  She said: Temperatures will be unseasonably cool the time of year next week, but spiking slightly above average Tuesday. High pressure forecast, with sunny spells and fair weather likely. The warmest day will be Tuesday, with highs peaking at 19C in London. The higher temperatures will be as a result of the flow of warmer air from the south ahead of low pressure.

Even before their wedding seven years ago, Kate was a fixture in the public eye, popping in and out of Mahiki, shopping on the King\u0027s Road and being spotted skiing with William and their aristo chums. The couple dated for 10 years prior to getting engaged, and even squeezed in one break-up. While we know William had ex girlfriends , little is known about Kate\u0027s romantic history. But, believe it or not, she does have one... There are some very handsome men lurking in her past, and it definitely looks like she had a type. Willem Marx The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at university, meaning they\u0027ve known each other for pretty much all of their adult lives.  However, before university, Kate dated Willem Marx, who is now a reporter and, according to his Twitter bio, author of Balochistan at a Crossroads (the proceeds of which going to Polio eradication). London-based Willem works for CNBC and covers geopolitical and company news across Europe including Brexit , US-Europe relations and international security. Now happily married to Italian TV presenter Johanna Botta with whom he has one son, Willem was Kate\u0027s first love, as one friend told the . Henry Ropner News in 2007 that William and Kate had split shocked the British public, who\u0027d assumed they\u0027d soon be announcing their engagement. While this separation was short-lived, Kate reportedly didn\u0027t waste her time moping into a bottle of cheap Chardonnay like the rest of us would.

Villagers in the Oriental Mindoro province in the Philippines flocked to see the 20ft long dead carcass, posing for selfies with it.

The clip shows the enthusiastic Archbishop repeatedly dunk a tiny baby into a baptismal font, both feet-first and headfirst in a busy church.  Children are seen step backwards in shock in the background before the clergyman hands the child back to his unperturbed parents. It is believed the clip was filmed in Ayia Napa, Cyprus, at a Greek Orthodox church. Greek Orthodox baptisms traditionally see the Archbishop dunk the baby into the font three times forcefully as the method is seen as a solution to address declining birth rates.  The video was shared widely on social media this week and many online have condemned this particularly rough approach. One Twitter user posted: Omg that’s the most violent baptism?! I’ve ever seen?!

I think Dundee Fashion Week is a brilliant idea, you can feel an exciting buzz around the city,”As well as clothing advice, Stephen Hewitt, co-owner of Aesthetique Beauty, brought his team along to provide eyelash applications.He said: “It was a no-brainer to get involved with Dundee Fashion Week.“I was already modelling for designer David Alexander in the finale catwalk but I soon realised that I could also be a part of fashion week.“As well as this pop-up shop, I am the official lash sponsor for the finale catwalk with all of the models wearing Nouveau lashes applied by my team.“Around 50 sets of lashes will be applied for the finale. Everyone you see on a catwalk has lashes on, so I thought, why not mine?”Peter Menzies, managing director of the Dundee Gin Company, was also on hand to keep attendees refreshed.He said: “Dundee Gin Company is proud to support Dundee Fashion Week and most of all Dundee and Angus College.“The work the students have put into this week is second to none and it is fantastic to showcase the amazing designers in the city.”A catwalk extravaganza to mark the end of the inaugural Dundee Fashion Week will take place at the Caird Hall on Sunday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af565297a8ff-e1526041869649-759x564.jpg ","title":"football club looks to find presidents chair which could be in someones living room","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe search is on to trace a piece of Arbroath FC history which could be sitting in someone’s front room.The president’s chair was donated in 1938 to mark the club’s 60th anniversary but its whereabouts are now a mystery.Some say the seat went up in smoke during a devastating blaze in 1958 which destroyed the main stand, including the boardroom.But no records exist for what was actually lost in the fire and there are hopes it might have been moved elsewhere and could still be in existence.Chairman Mike Caird said the club was appealing to supporters to check their own furniture to see if they have a piece of Arbroath history tucked away.“The president’s chair is yet another one of those beautiful football stories that has slipped through history, until now,” he said.“There is every chance this chair could be sitting in someone’s dining or living room.“Everyone at Gayfield would love to know if it is still out there.”The fire in 1958 destroyed the west and central portions of the main grandstand at Gayfield, with damage estimated at between £6,000-£7,000.The home and away dressing rooms, treatment room, referee’s room, secretary’s office, treasurer’s office, board room and press box were all ruined.All the photographic records of Arbroath’s great teams from the past were lost, along with playing kit, training kit, boots and footballs.The president’s chair was donated to the club in 1938 by cabinet maker Alexander Neilson as a token of his lifelong support.The seat was made in polished mahogany to mark the club’s 60th anniversary with the inscription “AFC, 1878-1938”.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"get involved and help clean up local beach","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVolunteers will join forces for a beach clean-up at Barry Buddon on Sunday.Running from 10am-noon, the event is being held by Monifieth Eco Force and Monifieth Rotary, and has the support of the MoD.Owing to the abundance of wildlife, and in particular nesting birds, the area has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.However, recently there has been an extremely large amount of plastic washed up so as many volunteers as possible are required.If you can help, meet at the barracks car park, dress appropriately and wear boots and gloves.Barry Buddon military training ranges are a historic part of the local community but the area is also rich in plants, insects and animals.Eco Force leads a wide range of environmental improvement and conservation activities throughout Monifieth and surrounding areas.These include monthly beach cleans, developing a community orchard and wildflower meadow, tree planting on the Dighty Burn green-space and producing floral displays in the town centre and the Blue Seaway garden.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hard work pays off for randy wolters after disagreement with dundee boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHe was Dundee’s forgotten man before a surprise recall on Tuesday saw Randy Wolters make his 15th appearance of the season.His start at Ross County was his first since October 28 and came with an assist for the only goal of the game as Simon Murray nodded in his cross.For the Dutchman, that recall shows all his hard work since dropping out of favour has paid off after a “disagreement” with manager Neil McCann.Speaking to Dutch outlet VI, Wolters said: “My fellow players told me I had earned it and forced it myself.“I must say, that did me something.“Later there were some supporters waiting for me who showed their appreciation.“I have said before you can give up or go on.“I chose the latter. Despite the disagreement, I had no further problems with the manager.“In the end he rewarded me. I am grateful for it.“The most important thing is that the club is safe.“If you do not play it is difficult but the people within the club have always supported me. Then this is very nice.”With a future in Dundee not certain after such a long time out of favour, Wolters doesn’t know what the future holds.He said: “I’m just waiting.“In any case, I know how it feels to be a footballer, that’s the most important thing.“I have not had that feeling for a long time and now I know what I have missed so much.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af2bdd4a9e6e-900x564.jpg ","title":"magnificent back line delights dundee boss mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann hailed a “magnificent” defensive display from his side as they laid to rest any relegation worries with a 1-0 win at Ross County.Going into the game in Dingwall, the Dark Blues were still not mathematically assured of survival, with Partick Thistle six points behind with two games to play.In the end, Thistle’s defeat at home to Motherwell meant Dundee would be safe anyway.However, Neil and his players wanted to get the job done themselves and did so thanks to Simon Murray’s 51st-minute header.Neil said: “It’s always a horrible position to be in.“I came into the job in this sort of position last season and it wasn’t enjoyable but we did the business pretty quickly in our first three games but Tuesday night it was still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball and began to play a wee bit.“I was unhappy with them at half-time with the start of the game and, indeed, at the start of the second we coughed up a chance.“However, when we play we know we are a difficult side to contain and we were always looking to hit them on the break once we got the first goal.”With their own survival at stake, the Staggies were desperate for a goal that could give them a lifeline.The Dundee defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it. There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/pastors-collage-940x564.jpg ","title":"ministers from nigeria visit dundee on mary slessor fact finding mission","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee church linked to famed missionary Mary Slessor is to welcome two men from the Nigerian city she lived and worked in this weekend.David Inyang, 47, is a minister in Calabar, Nigeria, while Otareh Otareh, 53, is an elder at the same church.They are both members of Calabar Presbytery.On Friday the two men will arrived in Dundee for a 10-day fact finding trip hosted by the Rev Robert Calvert from the Steeple Church.Mr Calvert said the trip by the two Calabar churchmen had been organised as part of a bid to bring Dundee and Calabar closer together because of their close ties with Mary.He said: “Mary is the link here. The two churchmen are coming over to Dundee to learn about life in the city and to allow us to learn about life today in Calabar.“We want to find out what similarities there may be today between the two cities and we want to forge a more permanent link with the city.“The men have a deep understanding of youth culture and they will be meeting young people in Dundee.”Mr Calvert said that during their stay the men will visit many local projects as well as schools.He added that he hoped that the exchange visits could become an annual event.Their itinerary includes a full tour of Dundee, visits to Craigie High School and Morgan Academy, a Mary Slessor tour, visits to the Hot Chocolate Trust and the Cafe Church at the Steeple and a visit to the Verdant Works.Mary Slessor, who is commemorated throughout Dundee, notably in Slessor Gardens, served as a missionary in Calabar for many years.During her long service she helped stop the killing of twins — who were thought by tribespeople to be the result of evil spirits.She rescued and adopted many of the twins, taught the people about the Christian faith and helped set up churches, schools and medical care.Mary lived among the tribes and was in constant demand to bring “God and Book” to the people.But she suffered bouts of severe ill-health due to the malaria she contracted in the Nigerian province.She died in Calabar on January 13 1915.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af564ee74570-e1526045769808-840x564.jpg ","title":"plans for affordable housing near new dundee super school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe second phase of a new housing development in the north-east of Dundee offering 28 affordable new homes has been unveiled.Housebuilders Merchant Homes and the housing association Home Group Scotland are behind the multi-phase plan to develop brownfield land between Haddington Avenue, Berwick Drive, Lothian Crescent and Dunbar Park in Whitfield.The homes will sit directly behind The Crescent community centre, and will be close to Ballumbie Primary School and the new North East Campus “super-school”.Proposals for the first phase of the development, containing 13 homes that will sit on Haddington Avenue, were unveiled earlier this year.In a planning statement submitted by Merchant Homes and Home Group Scotland (HGS), the firms said the development would suit the Whitfield area due to the ongoing residential regeneration that has unfolded over the last two decades.The land on which the new homes will sit was once the site of the Skarne-style blocks which dominated the Whitfield skyline.The new homes, the planners have pledged, will have affordable rents and be energy-efficient.The companies jointly said: “The proposal is for residential development that will provide a viable and marketable development consisting of private and affordable housing.“This is an awkward and challenging site in terms of shape, topography and existing services.“These factors have largely shaped the approach that has been taken to the development of the layout for the three phases.“Consequently, it is felt that the proposals respond to the client’s brief and the requirements of Dundee City Council’s Local Development Plan to provide a design solution of high quality, which harmonises with the location and provides a development of high quality for the future residents.”In all, the completed development will have 41 homes, all of which will have driveways, and 75% of the homes will have at least three bedrooms.HGS is also involved in other developments in the Whitfield area, such as the new-build homes which have been constructed on Summerfield Avenue.The developers have said the homes will look much the same as those that have been built already.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.
