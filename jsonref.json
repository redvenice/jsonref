Photograph: Damian ColemanSocial distancing and Covid certs gave the Guinness Cork Jazz Festival a very different feel this year but the constant rain provided a touch of familiarity.On Saturday, young and old were queuing outside to get into the pole Hotel on MacCurtain Street in Cork city, where the festival originated 43 years ago as a replacement for a cancelled bridge tournament.Katie Swayne from Midleton and her friend Aoife Healy from Blarney, who are both in their 20s, said they were delighted to see the festival return after it was cancelled last year due to the pandemic.Swayne expressed admiration for the hospitality sector which she felt was making a huge effort to keep bars safe in a time of Covid.Healy referred to a street market which was running down a side street next to the pole. She said that a lot of innovation has come from the Covid-19 pandemic with businesses putting in the hard work to stay open but safe for staff and patrons alike.“A lot of good has come to Cork in the last year. And everyone is still being cautious. We are being asked for Covid certs everywhere.”Roger Russell, general manager of the pole Hotel, said while it was wonderful to have the festival up and running again “capacity will have to be monitored very carefully to ensure all our guests and all our team members are safe. That is really important.“But one of the things about the festival is that that it always brings a smile to faces and the atmosphere is always so warm and friendly.”James Lancaster of the New York Brass Band is celebrating his 10th year at the festival.“It is really exciting. We missed it last year. We kind of feel like part of the furniture when we come to places like the pole. We feel like we have come home.”Meanwhile, publican and restaurateur Ernest Cantillon, who owns Electric barrestaurant and Sober Lane bar in the city centre, said they were busier this bank holiday than in 2019, when the festival last took place.He is finding that both the public and management in pubs and restaurants are still very aware that the country is opening up at a sensitive time in the pandemic with rising numbers of Covid-19 patients in hospitals.“In Sober Lane last night, we had a really good brass band that would nearly be impossible not to dance to so we asked them to take a bit longer time between songs. People would go down to their seat and it calmed it down a bit. We are kind of getting cute like that.The festival is normally worth an estimated €35 million to Cork city but with fewer events, a closed airport and Covid-19 regulations it is expected it will add considerably less to the coffers of hotels and bars this year.Lord Mayor of Cork, Cllr Colm Kelleher, says that local business owners, bars, hoteliers and musicians are “thrilled” at the return of the festival.“The hugely significant economic impact as well as the vibrancy and energy it brings to Cork city and surrounding area is unparalleled – there is nothing else like it.“Covid hasn’t gone away. We have to be aware of that but that doesn’t mean we can’t get back to some sort of normality. This weekend all roads lead to Cork.”The festival was the brainchild of Jim Mountjoy, the then pole Hotel marketing manager, way back in 1978.Over the years it has featured many greats including Ella Fitzgerald, BB King, George Shearing, Art Blakey and Mel Tormé. The line-up has become more eclectic over the last decade and incorporates different types of music, a move that has had its supporters and detractors.Headline acts this year include trumpeter Matthew Halsall and the hugely popular Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, made up of seven brothers from the south side of Chicago. Yasiin Bey Big Band (fka Mos Def) will close the festival on Monday evening.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"irish flock abroad once we board the plane we ll start believing","story":"John Purcell with his wife Éadaoin plus son and daughter Odhrán (9) and Saorlaith (7), from Kilkenny. Photograph: John Ohle“I’ll be happier when I’m sitting on the plane with a gin and tonic in hand,” says Angela Skarmoutsos as she stands in the departures area of Terminal One at Dublin Airport on Saturday with children Joshua (15), Eleni (12), and Nikos (7) in tow.Her husband, Yiannis, is nowhere to be seen. “He’s running back to the car to get Nikos’s iPod because he won’t last eight days without it,” she explains.The family are among 224,000 people passing through Dublin Airport over the weekend, which the DAA say is the busiest of the year so far after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in spite of rising case numbers.They are heading for Nice in the south of France to see Angela’s sister before travelling on to Saint-Tropez on the Côte d’Azur. “This is our August holiday fast forwarded to October,” she says. “The plan is to relax, try not to work, drink lots of wine, and get some sun.”Such was the “absolute nightmare getting parking”, they were forced to travel down from Bangor, Co Down, on Friday night and stay in a hotel. But, that aside, the whole family are in high spirits.“The kids have not been away in just over two years so it’s really exciting. Even just being in an airport is nice.”At the other end of the terminal, Éadaoin Purcell, her husband John, and children Odhrán (9) and Saorlaith (7) have travelled from Co Kilkenny and are waiting to board a flight to Malaga in Spain. They are among a party of 19.“My dad was 75 in April and we didn’t get to celebrate it because of Covid, so we’re all going over for a belated celebration,” says Éadaoin, who adds that the family has not been abroad since the onset of the pandemic.“It’s been all staycations, but we’ve made the most of it,” says John. “We were lucky enough to buy a camper van so we went around Ireland for a couple of weeks. We’ve done as much as we could do, and getting away now is brilliant. We’re rearing to go.“Once we get through security and are about to board the plane, we’ll start believing. It’s just been put off and put off with the Covid restrictions changing so we haven’t allowed ourselves to get too excited, but it’s more real now that we’re here with the bags.”There are no nerves regarding Covid-19, and the extra red tape involved in travelling during a pandemic has not been an issue. “I’m actually surprised Spain are letting the Irish in,” says John. “There’s more chance of catching it here – or in Coppers – than there is there.”Manuel Pombo from Madrid and Esther Olea from Valladolid are recently married and are about to make their way into the terminal to travel to Spain to see their families for the first time in almost two years. Manuel has been living here 14 years and Esther for 11 years.Esther says being away from her family has been “difficult”, while Manuel says: “I miss them less.”Esther continues: “For me, it has been terrible. We thought about going last year but you could not move in Spain between regions so we decided to leave it, but it has been very hard.“We got married here during the pandemic and we were supposed to go to our families and celebrate the wedding but that never happened.“We could only have six people at the wedding, so it was a very small affair. We were supposed to get married in June and we had to change the date a couple of times and ended up getting married in September on a Tuesday at 10 in the morning. Nothing fancy.“It was my father’s birthday recently as well, and my aunt is celebrating 55 years of marriage, so we are going to spend a lot of time eating and drinking. No big parties, just family gatherings.”Are they worried about Covid? “I am very worried,” says Manuel. “She is not so much. But I have literally almost not left the house in a year and a half. So this whole concept of being around this many people is challenging.“In Spain, everybody is very huggy and says hello with two kisses. I’m sure it’s safe and everyone is fully vaccinated, but there is a little bit of anxiety here.”Are you worried about the plane? “I have been trying not to think about it,” he says. “It’s a risk but it is a managed risk and you can’t stop living your life.”Over at Terminal Two, Paul Neeson, who is coincidentally Dublin Airport’s retail director, is on his way with his wife Marie to board a plane to Nice. “It’s a business trip but there are worse places in the world to be than Nice and Cannes,” he says.“It is my first time abroad in 18 months and my job would have involved travelling every month before Covid, so part of this weekend is just the pleasure of getting up in the sky again.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"oldest family owned music shop in ireland closes after 150 years","story":" Geraldine Byrne, (left) daughter and Maria Byrne, wife of Charlie Byrne, prepares a violin for sale while waiting for the last customers before the closure of the family owned music shop after 150 years in business. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  What is believed to be the oldest family owned musical instruments shop in Ireland closed its doors on Saturday after over 150 years in business.Owner Maria Byrne (89) has run the Charlie Byrne shop, located on Stephen Street in Dublin, alongside her husband, Charlie (90), for almost 60 years.Their daughter Geraldine stepped in 30 years ago to help with the running of the shop.Mrs Byrne cherishes memories of all the happy conversations she has had with customers over the years.Many regular customers called in to say farewell in the final days “and to say how sorry they are that we are closing”, she noted.“I have lots of fond memories. We have met such a range of different people from all over the world. They became friends more than customers.“We also had a lot of tourists. We had people coming from Canada who would come in every two or three years to see us.”Mrs Byrne was particularly touched the previous Saturday when an older gentleman came in and recalled buying his first instrument in the shop.“He was very elderly - and I am 89, putting it that way. He was an elderly gentleman, older than me,” and he said he had bought his first violin there 80 years ago. “Isn’t that something? He came in especially to talk to us.”She is proud they have managed to keep the business family-owned from when the first Charlie Byrne opened the premises in 1870.They decided to close due to the ill health of her husband.“We have to mind him so we put family first. We can’t do both. I am nearly 60 years working here.“It is an emotional time but we know we are doing the right thing. My daughter Geraldine and her husband have two little boys and we all live together. Family has to come first.”Mrs Byrne said on the first day of their closing down sale they had queues down the street with musicians playing instruments and creating a festive mood outside the premises. “It was manic. It was like a session.”She laughs when she recalls that “Charlie took up fishing and I caught him. I moved from selling fishing tackle to music.”“A lot has happened. We had a fire in 1992 and our daughter Geraldine came in to help us run it then. She knew the business,” Mrs Byrne told The  on Saturday morning.“I better go now because I need to put the lights on to start the business for the day.

Photograph: Anadolu Culture CenterAFP via Getty ImagesTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday he had ordered the foreign ministry to declare 10 ambassadors from western countries “persona non grata” for calling for the release of philanthropist Osman Kavala. Mr Kavala has been in prison for four years, charged with financing nationwide protests in 2013 and with involvement in a failed coup in 2016. He denies the charges.In a joint statement on October 18th, the ambassadors of Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, New Zealand and the US called for a just and speedy resolution to Mr Kavala’s case, and for his “urgent release”. They were summoned by the foreign ministry, which called the statement irresponsible.“I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done: These 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once. You will sort it out immediately,” Mr Erdogan said in a speech, using a term meaning that a diplomat is no longer welcome in the country.“They will know and understand Turkey. The day they do not know and understand Turkey, they will leave,” he said to cheers from the crowd in the northwestern city of Eskisehir.The US, German and French embassies and the White House and US state department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Norwegian foreign ministry said its embassy in Ankara had not received information from Turkish authorities regarding the matter at this time.“Our ambassador has not done anything that warrants an expulsion,” the ministry’s head of communications, Trude Maaseide, told Reuters in an emailed statement, adding that Turkey was well aware of Norway’s view on this case.“We will continue to call on Turkey to comply with democratic standards and the rule of law to which the country committed itself under the European Human Rights Convention,” Ms Maaseide said.Mr Kavala was acquitted last year of charges related to the 2013 protests, but the ruling was overturned this year and combined with charges in another case related to the coup attempt.Rights groups say his case is emblematic of a crackdown on dissent under Mr Erdogan.Mr Kavala said on Friday that it would be “meaningless” for him to attend his trial as a fair hearing was impossible given recent comments by Mr Erdogan.The Turkish president was cited on Thursday as saying the ambassadors in question would not release “bandits, murderers and terrorists” in their own countries.“Since there is no possibility of a fair trial under these circumstances, I believe participating in hearings and delivering my defence will be meaningless from now on,” Mr Kavala said in a written statement.The European Court of Human Rights called for Mr Kavala’s immediate release in late 2019, saying there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence, and finding that his detention had been intended to silence him.It issued a similar ruling this year in the case of Selahattin Demirtas, former head of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party, who has been held in jail for nearly five years.The Council of Europe, which oversees the implementation of ECHR decisions, has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey if Mr Kavala is not released.The next hearing in the case against Mr Kavala and others is due on November 26th. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Industry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"client dennis hutchings treated appallingly system has change","story":"I have worked on “legacy” issues in Northern Ireland for 23 years and have experienced the process in many cases. Initially, examining the legacy of the Troubles meant delivering closure for the families of those killed, something I think everybody, bar the terrorists and their associates, would support. Later, it came to mean trying to prosecute people for killings during the Troubles, a far more contentious process. Ultimately, both approaches have failed.Today, addressing Northern Ireland’s legacy means elderly veterans being dragged through inquests, criminal investigations and court hearings. Some, such as my client Dennis Hutchings, die in the process. The families don’t get the justice they seek. Most are not even able to enter into this process, as the terrorists who killed 90 per cent of the victims are not involved. The system doesn’t benefit anyone apart from the lawyers.I am a lawyer asking that it stops. It is time to accept that the criminal legal system will not deliver the convictions some want and impose a statute of limitations.In order to prove that the system is broken we only need to look at some of the cases that have failed.The Saville Report into Bloody Sunday followed the longest and most detailed public inquiry ever held. It hasn’t led to a single successful prosecution. Everyone has a right against self-incrimination and so to enable soldiers and the terrorists who fired that day to give evidence to the inquiry, it was agreed that nothing they said could be used against them.The trial of two soldiers accused of killing Joe McCann collapsed in May precisely because it was built on this inadmissible evidence, a fact that was obvious to everybody as long ago as the 1970s. Such technical issues in effect prevent prosecutions from before 1973.Even if such cases were not subject to these blocks, the delay in bringing the prosecution and the difficulty of proving the crime mean they almost certainly would have failed.In most historic examples of war crimes, it is a question of identity. Whether or not the accused was a concentration camp guard, for example. By contrast, military cases in Northern Ireland are hugely complex. Usually they hinge on a split second decision to fire made 40 years ago. Soldiers at the time signed statements that they were entitled to fire and had committed no crime. All these years laters, memories have faded and witnesses died. It is hugely difficult to unpick the details of events and next to impossible to prove that the soldier on trial had criminal intent. It is an abuse of process to allow the prosecution.Mr Hutchings was accused of murdering John Patrick Cunningham, a 27-year-old man shot dead in 1974. Had he got to his evidence, Mr Hutchings would have explained that he fired shots into the air and had not fired at Mr Cunningham at all. The Prosecution received witness evidence from soldiers stating that Mr Hutchings did not shoot Mr Cunningham, while another soldier admitted that he had shot Mr Cunningham.It emerged last week, when the prosecution fire arms expert was giving evidence, that this soldier had fired tracer bullets. These would have left a chemical signature. We could have tested the field dressings that Mr Hutchings applied to try and save Mr Cunningham’s life, but they had not been kept by the police. We could have tested Mr Cunningham’s clothes but they had not been kept. Essential evidence that would have helped prove Mr Hutchings’ innocence was no longer available. It is clear that we cannot go on like this.One option that has been suggested is a truth and reconciliation process. But that will only work if comes with a genuine desire to seek the whole truth. My sense is that the last thing the paramilitaries will do is open up as the army has. Sadly, those connected with terror organisations who since became politicians also fail to see the hypocrisy in calling for such a process while keeping quiet about what they know.The only fair way to proceed is with a statute of limitations, something I would like to see known as “Dennis’s Law”. This would simply reflect the reality for the vast majority of people given that ninety per cent of the crimes during the Troubles were committed by unknown terrorists and that the chances of prosecuting British soldiers are extremely slim.It would also save any other elderly soldiers from having to suffer the same ordeal as Mr Hutchings. Soldiers who served overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan have protection from prosecution, those who served in Northern Ireland deserve the same.Philip Barden is a partner at Devonshires SolicitorsMore from NewsLabour calls for VAT cut on energy bills ‘to see people through the winter’Rishi Sunak to spend billions to digitise NHSRishi Sunak in row over Treasury’s failure to cut business rates in BudgetGetting a booster jab is the key to ensuring we can all enjoy ChristmasGet the booster jab to save Christmas, Britons urged as country faces Covid ‘crunch point’The Queen to be joined on public visits by other royals in case of future health scaresMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"face to face doctors appointments slashed reduce road traffic","story":"Hundreds of patients have had their face-to-face appointments cancelled or rescheduled in a bid by NHS chiefs to cut traffic during Cop26.The climate conference in Glasgow is set to attract more than 25,000 delegates and 125 world leaders during its two week run from October 31.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the largest health board in the UK, admitted they have rearranged some in-person appointments to manage the “temporary increase” in population. Virtual and online consultations will be increased but “urgent appointments” and cancer referrals will continue, the board confirmed.The move forms part of a wider plan from the city to “substantially” reduce road traffic ahead of the summit’s opening.Patients have reportedly received letters over the past week informing them of the changes, according to the Glasgow Herald. One woman, suffering from severe long Covid symptoms, told the paper she was “outraged” to find her appointment had been moved after waiting months to see a specialist.Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s health and Covid recovery spokeswoman, described the decision as a “recipe for disaster”.“This will come as a fresh blow to patients who have already been languishing on waiting lists for months,” she added.Meanwhile local health chiefs have also raised concerns that delegates arriving from countries with poor rates of vaccination will drive Covid-19 infections in the capital.Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said: “People coming from different parts of the world, some where the vaccination programme is not the same as ours, there are risks associated with that.“Then you put people in touch with one another, in folk\u0027s homes, and that increases the risk even more.”Rail strikes are also expected to go ahead for the duration of the summit following a row over pay with ScotRail workers.Mick Lynch, general secretary for the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, said the decision to press on with industrial action was made on Friday after the train company “failed to get serious” in talks with the union.Additionally 100,000 protesters, from groups including Extinction Rebellion, are expected on November 6 which has been designated as the Global Day for Climate Justice.A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said:“Ahead of Cop26, we are working closely with partners to ensure robust plans are in place to enable us to respond to demands for healthcare during the conference, which includes responding to the temporary increase in population.“All of our hospital facilities will remain open and operational throughout the conference.“The Glasgow City transport plan for Cop26 requires the city to reduce road traffic substantially ahead of and during the event.“As part of our contribution to that we have moved face-to-face appointments to different times and increased virtual appointments. All urgent appointments and those for people with cancer will continue.”More from NewsLabour calls for VAT cut on energy bills ‘to see people through the winter’My client Dennis Hutchings was treated appallingly.

We’ve made phenomenal progress, but our job isn’t finished yet, and we know that vaccine protection can drop after six months.”In an article written after the Prime Minister redeployed Emily Lawson, the head of his new delivery unit, back to the health service to resume responsibility for the rollout, Prof Powis stated: “This time last year, the whole country was bracing itself for another lockdown.“There were more than 6,800 people in hospital with Covid, and cases and admissions were rising at an alarming rate. Fast forward to today and cases are rising again, with 6,405 people in hospital with Covid going into this weekend.”Last week, it emerged that fewer than four million of the 8.5 million at-risk people who had a second jab at least six months ago had received their third dose.Meanwhile, British people who want a Christmas holiday abroad were being advised to get a third jab because countries may impose stricter definitions of what constitutes being fully vaccinated.From November 1, Israel will only admit to their country those people who are either still within six months of their second jab or those who have a third booster jab if those six months have elapsed.About 2.2 million people each week will become eligible for a booster jab because six months will have elapsed since their second jab, the time period when efficacy of the vaccine begins to wane.Paul Charles, a travel expert, believes many countries will soon insist all Britons have had three vaccines before being let in.“We are now at the stage where we are well over six months since the first British people had their jabs. You’ve got to get a booster because what countries are doing is looking to ‘de-risk’ entry,” he said.“It might well end up being that if you want to travel at Christmas, you’ve got to have had the booster. They want to make sure that anybody entering is vaccinated with all the latest possible jabs.”More from NewsLabour calls for VAT cut on energy bills ‘to see people through the winter’My client Dennis Hutchings was treated appallingly.

And just four weeks after the booster campaign began, around half of those eligible have had their top-up, including more than nine in ten care homes with clinics booked or already delivered.The scale, speed and precision of the NHS Covid vaccination programme has cleared a path for the country to find its way out of the pandemic. The freedom we now all enjoy, and hope to continue embracing, is a direct result of the country’s willingness and desire to come forward for a Covid jab when it has been offered.More than 38 million people have had both doses and millions more are now going to get their booster shot. In recent days we have seen record bookings. And this half-term, parents of 12 to 15 year olds can book their child their first dose at hundreds of sites.Although the country once again finds itself at a crunch point, the NHS vaccination programme remains the strongest weapon in the armoury. Because we rolled out jabs so quickly, we are likely to see protection from the virus waning sooner than other countries. That means that without a booster, many people will find themselves more vulnerable to Covid, going into winter. So it’s vital that everyone gets their top-up jab as soon as they are eligible.People will be contacted to book their jab six months after their second dose. And if for some reason you don’t receive an invite, you will be able to book directly through the national booking service after you become eligible.We have to seize the moment, get our booster jab and protect ourselves as we go into what will no doubt be a tough winter, particularly as we are likely to see seasonal flu pose a risk to our health. And to maximise the impact of the vaccination programme we must all continue to act responsibly.The more of us that come forward for our booster jab, and the more we keep our resolve in helping to limit the spread of infection, then the greater chance we all have of staying well.So, when your time comes, take up the offer, book your booster and protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned and deserve to enjoy.Prof Stephen Powis is the National Medical Director of NHS EnglandMore from NewsLabour calls for VAT cut on energy bills ‘to see people through the winter’My client Dennis Hutchings was treated appallingly.

Whether two hours makes a real difference in terms of risk is, I think, doubtful.“I suspect two hours was chosen mostly to do with the fact that anything important is done in two hours. Two hours is not a magical number.”Although cases and deaths have begun to rise in recent weeks, Prof Hunter said that the expected surge in winter infections will not be “anywhere near as bad as it was last year”.Modelling from the University of Warwick found that a winter wave would peak at about 1,500 hospital admissions a day, far below the 4,000 a day during the peak last January.Prof Hunter added that the Government is likely to “let the virus rip” this winter, with Downing Street relying on the success of the vaccination rollout to mitigate the expected rise in cases.Marcus Fysh, the Conservative backbencher and member of the Covid Recovery Group, said: “This is the first I have heard of two hours being something that is of any significance on a scientific basis. I am deeply sceptical that this would have any effect at all. So frankly, I would ignore it.“It is the hospitalisations that are the key issue and the deaths that result. They seem to be tracking below what people expected to happen from this wave moving through. So I just think it’s unnecessary.“It seems to be an extraneous thing that someone has come up with it because they wanted to be able to say something about it rather than it being meaningful in any real sense.”The advice from the HSE also recommends that businesses install carbon dioxide monitors to give a “rough indication” of whether the natural ventilation from open windows is “sufficient”.It adds: “Levels of CO2 creep up during longer or busier meetings. They remain high for a long period of time – even after the room has been vacated.”Prof Robert Dingwall, a former member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said “a lot of uncertainties” remain on the evidence for aerosol transmission of Covid-19 indoors.While good ventilation is “desirable,” he admitted that the advice was “verging on the cautious”.Prof Dingwall said: “Good ventilation is certainly desirable, it probably makes a bit of difference. Nobody should be in a meeting for more than two hours, anyway.“I think what one can say is this is reasonable advice, but it should be open to review as we learn more about the circumstances of transmission. You could say it is verging on the cautious, but I wouldn’t be too dismissive of it. But that’s probably because I don’t approve of meetings lasting that long.”A spokesman for the HSE said: “Employers must make sure there’s an adequate supply of fresh air – ventilation – in enclosed areas of the workplace. HSE’s guidance helps employers identify, assess and reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus (Covid-19) in their inidual workplace setting.“We’ve provided some examples to help employers take practical steps to improve ventilation in different scenarios. Deciding on what measures to put in place to achieve adequate ventilation depends on the specific workplace and should be part of an employer’s risk assessment.”More from NewsLabour calls for VAT cut on energy bills ‘to see people through the winter’My client Dennis Hutchings was treated appallingly.

An unlikely figure, you might think, to have shot to fame as a scourge of woke pieties and a committed critic of America’s anti-racist movement. But McWhorter has never allowed himself to be bullied out of saying what he thinks, a courageous tenacity on full show in his new book, Woke Racism, published last week in the US.Thus the arguments of Woke Racism will speak loud and clear to audiences here too, even if it is centred on the American landscape. The book argues that in its haste to define black people as victims, the new “religion” of woke has reimposed racist strictures on the horizons of African-Americans. This is not the first time McWhorter has made such arguments. In 2000, he published the best-selling Losing the Race: Self Sabotage in Black America, a passionate elucidation of the way “victimology”, “separatism” and “anti-intellectualism” were holding African-Americans back. This was followed by Winning the Race in 2006, a less polemical treatment. But McWhorter’s talents and interests extend far beyond race. He is a specialist in Creole: of the 22 books he’s written, 17 are about language (four about Creole), and one, All About the Beat, is about hip hop. He’s also a passionate and knowledgeable musicologist, and committed to “reclaiming black music”, including opera.Like their millions of listeners, I had long been dazzled by the wry, intellectual charm on show in McWhorter’s wide-ranging conversations with fellow black anti-wokester, the Brown economics professor Glenn Loury, on Loury’s cult The Glenn Show. I wanted to know: how did McWhorter come to swim so hard, yet gracefully, against the tide?In search of an answer, I meet him in his roomy, homely New York apartment, full of books and records. His tenaciously friendly cat firmly outside the study, McWhorter sits in his swivel chair, fingers in a pyramid under his chin, and explains to me how he got to be who he is.“It happened in the 1990s,” McWhorter begins. “I had grown up thinking that the old days for black people had been horrible, that there had been great victories in the 1950s and 1960s, and that I was lucky enough to have grown up in the 1970s and 1980s when things had gotten so much better. I thought, there is a victory that black people forged and I am taking advantage of it. And yes, racism exists… and yes, the past is not completely over, but… this is a new world.”Then came “the response in the black community” to the Rodney King verdict of 1992: three of the four police officers filmed beating King in LA during an arrest for drunk driving were acquitted, sparking a week of rioting that killed 63 and injured 2,383 and had to be stopped by the National Guard and the Army. “I didn’t understand why people took the Rodney King verdict as evidence that all black people live in a country where it’s difficult for us to get justice. That struck me as something somebody could plausibly have said in 1960, but not 1991... Why is it that these perfectly sensible people have this melodramatic view of racism in this country? And that’s where it began,” he says.So has anything changed since he wrote Losing the Race? “The sad thing is that here in 2021, the word on the street about race is similar to what it was,” says McWhorter. Things had been “getting better” thanks to a consensus that emerged around 2010 “that racism exists but… black people’s problems are due partly to bias and partly to cultural problems that people have to work on themselves”.“That’s partly why I’ve started kicking harder than I have in about 15 years. Because it won’t do. We’ve got to get rid of this idea that ‘yes we can’t’ is a constructive mantra.”As for the murder of George Floyd, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement’s meteoric rise, it was “egregious and it’s important we know about it. It’s also important we know that white Tony Timpa was killed the same way in Texas four years before”.McWhorter, an ardent fan of Keeping Up Appearances (he’s watched it all four times over), thinks class is a useful tool for understanding who is a victim and who is not, and regrets that it’s not part of the American conversation. “In the US roughly we think that black people are lower class and white people are middle class and we don’t like to talk about the lower class whites. We say, it doesn’t matter that they don’t have much money, they still have white privilege, because supposedly the cops are nicer to them, but in fact the cops aren’t nicer to miscreant white men, but we don’t talk about that.”The reason, of course, for this tunnel vision is critical race theory (CRT), a strain of academic thought that foists everything into the halter of power struggle. White people are always oppressors, black people always their victims. It is a mandatory ideology in many workplaces – corporate, state and educational – in the form of unconscious bias training, a practice McWhorter abhors. “If Columbia requires me to do that I am going to formally refuse and see what happens.” I ask McWhorter if his career as a linguist has helped sharpen his critique of the pretentious jargon of wokedom he skewers so well in Woke Racism. He says no: he’s a language “nerd” and that’s separate, except it isn’t, because “I like teaching myself Russian etcetera and then I’m trying to be the nerd that I am, and there’s this whole dialogue that is telling me that to be a nerd about anything but Martin Luther King means I’m not black… how dare you study Russian, especially some white language, when you should be on the barricades with us studying black things, and my thought was always, well, I do study some black things, but is it that urgent? Are we that oppressed?” McWhorter admits his own first academic positions at Cornell and Berkeley were tokenistic, rather than based on merit, though that is certainly no longer the case. What, then, of America’s vexed commitment to affirmative action – whereby standards for racial minorities are relaxed to get them into elite institutions?  “In 1966, to apply that policy to black people overall made sense because most black people were poor, it was a different world. I agree with not having one standard of grades and test scores. But you do it based on socioeconomics, you don’t do it based on race, and you don’t hire black people with visibly lesser qualifications with the idea that that’s somehow doing the right thing.”Woke Racism is stuffed with frank talk like this, and McWhorter expects it to appeal to a liberal “middle ground” – black and white – tired of being accused of being racists or race-traitors. Can a book, however clever and appealing, make a difference? “There’s a crack in everything and the light gets in,” says McWhorter, quoting Leonard Cohen. Our time is up, the cat demands to be fed and his daughters will soon be home from the babysitter. I leave uplifted: this intellectual, fair-minded man has identified a hungry demand for “another voice” and is feeding it with nourishing common sense, wit and a strong dose of reality. “Things,” as he says, “are changing”. He must be right.More from NewsLabour calls for VAT cut on energy bills ‘to see people through the winter’My client Dennis Hutchings was treated appallingly.

Relatively little provenance work has been done. The level of information we have really varies. Once we know the communities of origin, we will look to reach out to them.“We will have to reach out to communities, who in many cases will be hearing about remains being taken for the first time. That can cause huge distress.”Ms de Alarcon does not believe this approach invites “trouble” by creating new claims for repatriation, and the museum has previously outlined its plan to address how it acquired items during the pomp of Britain’s empire through “military force or coercion”.The curator said: “We can probably assume that none of these remains were willingly given. I have never come across any records of someone saying ‘Here, please take this’ and handing over their family members’ remains.”In a bid to redress this, the new £31,000-a-year curator will first try and identify where items have come from, without invasive testing, then aim to contact communities descended from those who may have been coerced into giving up human remains historically.These communities will then be consulted on the future of relevant objects, with curators aiming to let them decide whether they should be redisplayed, stored or removed from the collection and repatriated.Repatriation may not stop there, with Ms de Alarcon stating: “It’s a lot of work. But if we get to the stage when we are finished with human remains, we can move on to things that were looted.”The museum, founded in 1884 at the University of Oxford to house Augustus Pitt Rivers’ anthropological collection, holds about 2,800 specimens gathered from six continents.The collection s trophy heads from the Naga people in India, Shuar and Achuar shrunken heads from Ecuador, skulls from Canada, scalps from the US and an entire female skeleton from Australia. Information on the origins of items varies in detail, with some specimens only bone fragments or everyday objects made with samples of human hair.The newly announced role “primarily focussed on collections provenance work regarding human remains” will entail establishing where poorly documented items come from, but also difficult discussions with aggrieved descendants.Ms de Alarcon said: “I think I’d be naive work that didn’t involve emotional labour on the part of people doing the work here. It’s a very exciting role, but could be deeply traumatic.”The museum returned more than 20 human remains since 2004, including Maori remains which were given to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in 2017.In 2020, human remains were removed from display, with curators fearing they were open to a “racist” misinterpretation of their culture of origin, with concerns some would be seen as “savage”.More from NewsLabour calls for VAT cut on energy bills ‘to see people through the winter’My client Dennis Hutchings was treated appallingly.

However, the more that the virus is able to spread, the more chance there is of it finding a way to break through vaccine defences. Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"autumn budget 2021 predictions what","story":"Autumn Budget  predictions - and what spending review could mean for youThe future of the UK economy hangs in the balance when the Budget  is announced.

The energy bills price cap has already jumped by £ on October  and it’s set to rise again in April.Meanwhile furlough and the evictions ban have ended, Universal Credit ’s been cut by £ a week, and there are supply shortages in the shops.On top of the all that, the Tory Chancellor is set to unveil a three-year Spending Review that could put the squeeze on public services even further.So how will it all affect the country, and you and your wallet  Here are all the Budget confirmed policies, predictions and rumours so far. The Budget could lay out the full grim extent of the cost of living crisis to come this winter. Mr Sunak will read out GDP growth and borrowing figures which could y from earlier in the Covid pandemic. But the most important figure will be inflation - which is predicted by Budget watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility . Only in March it predicted inflation would be .% this year - it’s double that, and could rise even further. That will have a massive impact on families.  Inflation hikes the cost of your weekly shop and could turn into a spike in mortgage costs,the Bank of England raises the base rate later this year. They could also wipe out any increases in government spending or public sector wages. There is also a row over claims the Chancellor will use out-of-date data to polish up his claims about the economy in time for a   election.  Spending review squeeze Alongside the normal Budget will be a three-year ‘spending review’, setting out departments’ budgets right up to Spring . And while it won’t be a vehicle for the brutal austerity of George Osborne, there will likely be cuts hiding in plain sight. It’s no longer as fashionable for Tories to shout about making cuts, but after Covid spending they need to come from somewhere. That means we could see vague or unspecic lines about efficiency savings that have a huge impact on public services down the line. In the March Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studiesthink tank identied a £bn black hole that would make the Spending Review “particularly tough” for unprotected areas of government. While these don’t include the NHS they do include the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, and local government which funds social care. “There’s going to be something that feels a bit like austerity for at least some public serviceswe are going to keep to these spending plans,” said the IFS.  We already know Brits who earn over £, a year will see their National Insurance Contributions rise from % to .% from April . The £bn-a-year measure will cost £ a year for a worker on £, £ for a worker on £, and £ for a worker on £,. Firms will have to contribute too. From April , this .-point rise will be named the ’Health and Social Care Levyapos and appear separately on Britsapos payslips. From this point it will also apply to workers who are above pension age - which NICs do not. From October , the money will be partly used to fund a new £, cap on the amount people must pay for care over their letimes - and a new-style £, floor, which saves people from paying for their care once assets fall below a certain level. But just £.bn of £bn raised in the first three yearswill go on social care. Of the £.bn, half of it will go towards new costs caused by the cap and floor - leaving a measly £.bn or so for workforce, training, councils and better integration with the NHS. Minimum wage rise There was much hype at the Tory conference that Boris Johnson would push up the minimum wage - only for him not to announce anything solid. But the Mirror understands a standard annual rise for April  is expected to be announced in the Budget. Currently £. an hour for over-s , the Tories have claimed they’ll make it £. an hour for over-s by . That is because they claimed future rises would be pegged to two-thirds of median earnings, higher than the previous % target. Rishi Sunak shouldn’t take too much credit for the April  rise - after all, minimum wages rise every year, especially when inflation is up.But given Boris Johnson has pinned his hopes on businesses creating a “high-wage” economy, no doubt he will try to take the glory. Cigarette, alcohol and fuel duty changes  Tobacco duties tend to rise in the Budget - and could do so at pm on the same day to avoid bulk buying. The last rise in November  put p on a pack of  cigarettes and p on a g pack of hand-rolling tobacco. Tobacco duties rise using an escalator, which last time was % above RPI inflation . With inflation soaring, a similar escalator could impose a massive rise this year. But rises on beer, cider, wine and spirits were all frozen in the year from April . Now the whole structure of them could be overhauled . And fuel duty has been frozen for  years in a row and there’s no reason to suggest Rishi Sunak won’t make it a th. These days, each year’s freeze alone is projected to cost the Treasury around £bn a year by . That’s money that could be spent on green initiatives, public transport and cycling. But the political hit of raising fuel duty when petrol prices have just spiked to a nine-year high would be enormous. £m for children and families - after years of cuts The Chancellor has announced £m for children and families, including £m to set up family hubs in  new council areas. These will be a aposone-stop-shopapos to deliver parenting programmes , breastfeeding adviceand mental health support . It confirms reports that Rishi Sunak wanted to focus on childcare in his Budget. The money also includes a £m Start for Le offer, £m on workforce pilots and £m for expanding the Supporting Families programme. But it comes after the Tories cut £ a week from Universal Credit and imposed the two-child benefits limit. Nurseries also say they’re at breaking point, as the government doesn’t give them enough cash to run  hours’ a week free childcare properly. The Lib Dems warned the cash is a drop in the ocean after years of Tory cuts to services like Sure Start. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green added: “This is a smokescreen for the Conservatives’ failure to deliver for families.” Neil Leitch, CEO of the Early Years Alliance, said: “To invest in these new initiatives while leaving the existing early years infrastructure to crumble is, frankly, negligent. Transport upgrades in eight regions of England  A £.billion list of transport upgrade projects for eight regions of England is set to be confirmed. The Chancellor said projects will include improving the A between Wakefield and Leeds for buses, cyclists and pedestrians. New link tram vehicles will be ordered in Manchester while rail stations are revamped in Darlington, Middlesbrough, Liverpool and Runcorn. Overall Greater Manchester will get £.bn, West Midlands £.bn, West Yorkshire £m, Liverpool City Region £m, South Yorkshire £m, West of England £m and Tees Valley £m. The North East is set to get just over £m but projects will not be spelt out until a regional governance shake-up is complete. On top of the £.bn, Mr Sunak will pledge £.bn on buses by  to speed up journey times, simply fares and increase the number of services outside London, with details in the coming months. But of the £.bn to be announced only £.bn is new money. The cash for city regions was already announced as £.bn and is being increased. The £.bn on buses comes from a £bn pot Boris Johnson already announced in March. £m to revamp sports pitches The Treasury says there will be £million to build or improve up to , sports pitches across the UK. Up to  youth facilities like scout huts, youth centres and activity centres, will also be built or refurbished in deprived areas. VA, Tate and Natural History Museum get cash The Chancellor has confirmed a £m pot over three years for local culture, museums and galleries. Big bucks go to the VA in London, Tate Liverpool and the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, which share £m between them. Likewise the Natural History Museum will get £m to help build a new scientic research centre in Oxfordshire, and the British Library site at Boston Spa will get £m. Itaposs tougher competition for  other regional museums and libraries, who share £m between them. A fund for veteransapos health The government has confirmed a Veterans’ Health Innovation Fund worth £m over an unspecied timeframe. It will provide research grants into finding new surgeries for amputees and blast victims, and new mental health treatment. There will also be new technology to help injured veterans rebuild their lives and participate in work, education and sport. Things that are tipped to be in the Budget Public sector pay  In   public sector pay rises were paused, except in the NHS and for workers on less than £, who got a small rise. Political pressure is huge not to do the same thing again, especially with inflation and fuel bills savaging families’ existing budgets. But the problem for Rishi Sunak is, even a % or % rise in public sector wages would likely become a real-terms cut due to inflation. And that means having to spend a huge amount on any proper pay rise. Will he take the hit  And when - will he announce his intentions in the spending review like he did in , or wait for review bodies to report back next year  A massive shake-up in alcohol duties Treasury officials are said to see the current system of alcohol duties as outdated and complicated and want to smooth it out. The Chancelloraposs plans could see the cost of sparkling wine falling and some taxes on beer cut as well.But the spirits industry fears it could also mean % hikes for whisky, gin and other spirits which they say will hamper their recovery after Covid and Brexit.And craft and independent brewers fear changes to Small Breweries’ Relief . They say the government could more than halve the threshold for a % beer duty rate, piling £, extra in beer duty costs a yer on  small breweries. Society of Independent Brewerschief James Calder said: The uncertainty over what will happen to SBR is causing a great deal of anxiety.  A tax break for banks - at the same time as benefits are cut The Financial Times reported the Chancellor will slash a tax surcharge on bank profits from % to %. The move is supposedly designed to keep the City happy and prosperous as corporation tax rises from % back up to %. But it could provoke fury as the Chancellor as refused to provide the £bn needed to keep a £-a-week Universal Credit uplt. Universal Credit changes  DWP ministers have been lobbying Mr Sunak to raise Universal Credit for the .million claimants who work - weeks after cutting it by £. They want the “taper rate” - the amount of Universal Credit withdrawn for every pound someone earns - to be cut from p to p to let working families keep more of their money. The £bn a year move would be the first taper change in five years, and would partially cushion the blow of the £-a-week cut. But sources were downbeat about whether Mr Sunak would accept the move. And evena p change in the taper was approved, it would not come close to making up for the £-a-week cut for most families. A -year-old single mum working  hours a week on minimum wage could be £. a week better off. But because UC is being cut by £ across the board, she would still be £. worse off than she is now. Those still covered by work allowances, or too sick to work, would not benefit at all from changes to the taper. A rise in Air Passenger Duty Plane tickets to Australia, South Africa and Japan will become more expensivean Air Passenger Duty rise goes ahead.reports the Chancellor will confirm previously-mooted plans to reform the tax, levying a higher rate on longer journeys. Currently APD is charged in two bands - journeys under and over , miles. A new third band could cover distances over , miles. End of the line for HS to Leeds Fears are mounting that the Tories will abandon a key rail link to the Red Wall - despite promises it would go ahead. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps refused to guarantee the eastern leg of HS - the high speed line to Leeds - would still be built. The Spending Review could be a crucial time to confirm - or strangle off - funding to this project for the future. Slashing VAT on household bills Rishi Sunak could slash VAT on household energy bills to help struggling families through the winter cost of living crisis. The Chancellor is reportedly considering cutting the % rate even though he has resisted pressure to splash taxpayersapos cash where. But Treasury officials played down the likelihood of Mr Sunak announcing a cut amid concerns he might set a precedent - and send the wrong message ahead of a green summit. No big business rates reform The Treasury promised a ‘fundamental’ review of how business rates work back in March . But it’s thought we will not see any large-scale reform until next year after hopes to include it in this Budget fell apart. That is despite the fact a major overhaul of business rates is getting more and more urgent. High Street shops say they’re being left at a disadvantage compared to online warehouse giants like Amazon. No solid plan for ‘levelling up’ No doubt Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak will take all the above announcements as evidence of their plan to ‘level up’ the Midlands and north of England. But will there be a cohesive, coherent plan that spells out exactly what levelling up means  Don’t bank on that - we’ve not seen it properly so far, and one source suggested a levelling up White Paper will only arrive the week after the Budget.

As mentioned previously, I spend a lot of my week reading stuff so you don’t have to. It’s a pleasure, you’re welcome. This week it was a lot of stuff Mr C has been putting out on his blog, or whatever the name is of the  he’s using now.I can’t quite remember – there was a lot of it and I’m tired. He has options, this man – lots of them. The highlight was his plan for Labour. He says they are going about things the wrong way, concentrating on the wrong issues, and being led by the wrong leader. The great thing about Mr Cummings is that he is full of solutions.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  In this case, Labour’s solutions are simple: get tough on crime, get off issues like trans rights and appoint a woman, preferably one from the Midlands. He suggests Lisa Nandy, which is a good shout, despite her not being from the Midlands. But, you know, it’s hard to get hold of a large print Collins Road Atlas. Mr Cummings thinks Ms Nandy could do damage to the Tories, who he says are vulnerable in the North at the moment, despite the resounding election victory last time round. He also recommends moving Labour HQ to the North, which would upset a lot of people in London – but not me, because it would be a phenomenal excuse to go home more. We will see. But the idea that great world thinkers like the man himself have spotted the weaknesses in a previously untouchable position is interesting. It is a case of the right approach. I’m not sure crime is the magic bullet, and a blind spot people have in Westminster is treating the North like it is one homogenous entity. It isn’t. New polling of , Midlands voters backs this up, revealing the stunning conclusion that % of voters say the biggest fear for most of them is climate change.What’s more, % of people don’t think we’re doing enough to tackle the problem – this was highest in Hereford, at %, which is understandable I suppose, given the recent flooding there. Many of the ,, according to figures from Midlands Connect, would prefer electric cars and give up next day deliveries, foreign holidays, anything  that has an environmental impact to help tackle climate change. It is interesting reading, particularly as there is a growing feeling in Westminster that climate change and green issues – however important – are not cutting through. They clearly are. You can’t put the news on these days without seeing someone glued to a train or a motorway and COP starts in Glasgow next week, which should add a bit more momentum. Researcher ComRes has an eye on it too and its latest stats show support for the Greens is growing – although, worryingly, at Labour’s expense. It says: “New polling suggests that it might not take much for voters, particularly younger ones and those perhaps disaffected by Labour’s own green credentials, to make the switch.” Strange,after all this bickering over the Red Wall and the former Red Wall and the crumbling Blue Wall it turned out that, this whole time, it was Green.

New leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay demanded a bumped-up, one-off Winter Fuel Payment to be extended to every household in the country this year. It would come on top of the existing Winter Fuel Payment for pensioners and certain benefit claimants, worth between £ and £. That means people would be eligible for a maximum of £, the Green Party said, to help them cope with rises in the cost of living. It would be funded by a one-off, £billion windfall tax on all landlords of privately-rented homes - charging % of the value of their land. This is not the same as the value of the property itself, and can be less, but further figures were not immediately available. The co-leaders were due to announce the policy in their first speech to the Green Party conference this afternoon.  I comes after the energy price cap was hiked by £ on October , with another larger hike expected in April and energy firms pushing for a third hike in the middle of winter. Mr Ramsay said: “It’s a costed proposal to be funded from a one-off % land-value tax on residential landlord properties. “This proposal is about keeping households from spiralling into fuel poverty, it’s about keeping people safe. “It’s about the state responding to market failure. It’s about human dignity. “Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership. It’s an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand - something they just don’t get. It’s also just a bridge to get us to the tough work of a real, Green New Deal.” Green Party officials believe the scheme - essentially a form of universal basic income - could be a “bridge” to their pledge to invest £billion a year in a Green New Deal. The party has pledged to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by , two decades earlier than the government’s current pledge. Ms Denyer was expected to say in the joint speech: “People have grown tired of choosing the ‘least worst’ option. Of being patronised, ignored and told what to think. We are tired of a Tory government playing ide and rule. Tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people. Tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys club serving the interests of its pals. We need better - we demand better. We see none of it from an official opposition that fails the public, ignores the votes of its own members, and can’t take a stand on the biggest issues of the day.

He was later made a Crossbench peer in the House of Lords, which is today debating a Bill that will enable terminally ill adults to legally seek assistance to end their lives. Peers heard Lord Field - who campaigned against bereavement benefit cuts as chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee - was unable to attend today’s debate, having spent time recently in a hospice. Crossbench peer Baroness Meacher, who is leading the Bill, said: “Our colleague Lord Field of Birkenhead, who is dying, asked me to read out a short statement.” The statement from Lord Field said: “I’ve just spent a period in a hospice and I’m not well enough to participate in today’s debate. If I had been, I would have spoken strongly in favour of the second reading [of the Bill]. “I changed my mind on assisted dying when an MP friend was dying of cancer and wanted to die early, before the full horror effects set in, but was denied this opportunity. A major argument against the Bill is unfounded. It is thought by some the culture would change and people would be pressured into ending their lives. Do you support assisted dying  Join the debate in the Commons below.  The numbers of assisted deaths in the US and Australia remains very low, under %, and a former Supreme Court judge in Victoria, Australia, about pressure from relatives, said: ’It just hasn’t been an issue’. I hope the House will today vote for the Assisted Dying Bill. Lord Field was MP for Birkenhead on Merseyside from  to , making him one of the longest-serving MPs in the Commons.Born to a Tory labourer and teaching assistant during the Second World War, he was briefly a member of the Young Conservatives before joiningLabourfor most of his le.He first stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in South Buckinghamshire in  when he was .

The Assisted Dying Bill, tabled by Baroness Meacher, proposes that only terminally ill patients with full mental capacity, and are not expected to live more than six months would be eligible to apply for an assisted death. Campaigners argue that a change in the law would give those at the end of their lives greater control over how and when they die. Heartbroken Tory peer Michael Forsyth admitted he will back the bill after his dying father changed his mind. Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, told BBC Radio : “Just before he died I went to see him and said aposIaposm so sorry, dad, youaposre in this positionapos, and he completely took me aback by saying aposwell, youaposre to blame, because you and others have consistently voted against the right to die, I would like to be relieved of this, they canapost relieve the pain and I am in this position because of folk like you.”  However opponents, including many religious leaders, warned that it could leave vulnerable people exposed to unwanted pressure. The Archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told the BBC that although the safeguards in the legislation were stronger than in previous attempts to change the law, they still did not go far enough. What we want is assisted living, not assisted dying. “There is no dference between us in compassion.” The topic is being debated today in Parliament for the first time in six years. Previous attempts to introduce similar laws have all been defeated. Dame Prue Leith has backed the bill and slammed critics of “scaremongering” families. Writing in the , she said: “Opponents to the Bill fear that grasping children will coerce dying parents to get their doctors to see them off so they can inherit. If someone is going to die within six months anyway, which must be the case to qualy for assistance to die, why would anyone risk prosecution to get the money a few months earlier  This is despite her son, Tory MP Danny Kruger campaigning against the change in law. Mr Kruger set up the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well. Mr Johnson is not expected to back the plans and it is unlikely to become law without government support.

Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByMark Steel:,  Oct | commentsThese anti-vaxxer people get more excited every day, screaming at us to stop wearing masks. It’s hard to understand why they’re so angry about what we wear. Maybe they’ll move on to other garments. They’ll stand in shopping centres screaming: “DON’T WEAR UNDERPANTS. They’re part of a SINISTER PLAN by world governments to RUB THINGS AGAINST YOUR CROTCH.” Within a year Piers Corbyn will be at a rally in Trafalgar Square setting fire to a heap of socks, while David Icke makes a speech that “there’s no such thing as feet”. The problem is our government is almost as bonkers.  For example, MP Gillian Keegan said “wearing a mask shouldn’t be seen as a sign of virtue.” Because look at these smug types who wear a mask just because scientists agree it’s a main way of stopping the spread of a disease. It’s the same with these people who think they’re full of virtue, because they don’t ever take a leopard into an old people’s home. “Ooh, look at me”, they whine, “I’m such a goody-two-shoes making sure none of the residents get mauled by a wild animal.” We’re one of the few countries that hasn’t introduced vaccine passports for entry into nightclubs or cinemas. This is because it’s considered to be discrimination, against people who have decided not to have the vaccine. This is true, in the same way thatsomeone’s searched before they go into an event at a stadium, it discriminates against people who like carrying a set of swords and a flame thrower. The initial inquiry into the Government’s handling of the pandemic found them to be incompetent, having ignored the science, causing thousands of ­unnecessary deaths.  One of many low points was last December, when before a late U-turn, the Government announced “Boris has saved Christmas” by ignoring all the scientists that said you MUST NOT delay the lockdown until after Christmas. You might as well say “I SAVED THE BIRTHDAY” because you allowed the children’s party to go ahead, even though you discovered an unexploded bomb under the trle. They’ve been like that throughout, so now our Covid rates are rising faster than anywhere . And the Government says they’re considering a Plan B. For  months they have been announcing plans, then reversing them, insisting there will be no lockdowns a few hours before introducing lockdowns. They’re way past Plan B. If they’re on Plan B it’s because they’ve gone right round the alphabet and started again, like car registration numbers. Now they insist we have to “learn to live” with Covid. But learning to live with something doesn’t mean pretending it’s not there. Next week Johnson will tell us: “Scientists have warned that as winter’s coming, it might get cold. Their figures suggest it could get dark early, and there could be rain or even snow! “So rather than wear extra clothes or put the heating on, we recommend you learn to live with it.” Then we’ll see groups of people in every shopping centre yelling: “Don’t wear coats, there’s NO SUCH THING AS ­TEMPERATURE.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Longstanding problems that hold Britain back must be fixed – like low pay and insecure work. And we must see concrete plans to build a stronger, more resilient economy – backed by investment. Public services must be better funded, with good pay and conditions to attract and keep high quality staff. Too much of our economy has been taken over by business models that profit from low pay and denying workers’ rights. That must end. When government, business and unions worked together in the pandemic, we saved millions of jobs. Any serious plans to ‘build back better’ must be made with a seat for unions at the table, not just big corporations. And the Chancellor must make sure that ‘levelling up’ includes higher wages.

Labour analysis found the number of buy to let mortgages tripled after the chancellor announced the tax cut in his  budget.Last July, Mr Sunak announced that the zero rate would be increased from £  to £ . But the discount applied to landlords and second homeowners, and analysis of figures from UK Finance shows that buy to let mortgages tripled from   when the holiday was announced in July , to   in June  when the biggest discount came to an end. Meanwhile, the proportion of mortgages to first time buyers was down every month from October  to June . In March and April , the months before the holiday was first expected to end, the proportion of mortgages to first time buyers was down % on the previous year.  Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary Lucy Powell said: “The Conservatives have wasted millions of pounds on a stamp duty holiday which benefitted landlords and second homeowners, over first-time buyers trying to get a foot on the ladder. “Rather than seeing homes as the bedrock of a stable and successful le, the Conservatives treat housing as a commodity to be traded and profited from.”  First time buyers lost out in every region. In the South West, mortgages to first time buyers were down % on the previous year in April . In the North West, they were down % in March , and the East and West Midlands were down % in the same month. Ms Reeves added: “Labour is the true party of home ownership. Rather than robbing first-time buyers of their advantage, we would give them first dibs on new build homes, and stop the scandal of developments being sold off plan to overseas investors.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “Our temporary stamp duty cut helped to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs which rely on the property market by stimulating economic activity.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyFirst-time buyersMortgagesStamp dutyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His predecessor, Amanda Milling was driven around in an electric I-PACE Jaguar until she lost her job as party co-chair in September’s reshuffle. But just a month before the UK hosts world leaders at the COP climate conference in Glasgow, Mr Dowden opted to keep the petrol-powered car and driver he had in his previous job as Culture Secretary. A Tory source said: “Amanda Milling went for an electric car when she was offered as she thought it was important for the Conservative party chair to do their bit for the environment ahead of COP. “But Oliver clearly doesnapost feel the same. When he arrived at CCHQ he asked for a petrol one instead.” But a spokeswoman for Mr Dowden said: “He has a lovely driver and just wanted to keep working with him. Someone has got the wrong end of the stick.”  As Minister without Portfolio, Mr Dowden’s limousine is provided by the Government Car Service at taxpayer expense. Drivers come with a specic car, and while some ministers retain their driver and car when changing departments, not all do. Mr Dowden’s spokeswoman said he had “just kept same drivers from [his former department] as many ministers do when they move.”  In June, Mr Dowden helped launch the Tech Zero Taskforce at the CogX tech conference in London. He told attendees: “I hope this marks a turning point in our fight against climate change – and it’s right that the tech industry leads the charge.” But Mr Dowden has voted against a string of opposition motions in the Commons calling on the government to make commitments to tackle the climate crisis.

Zykiah Ditchett, from Worsley, Salford, Greater Manchester, was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder at the age of  after concerns were raised over his “constant” cleaning at home. In a bid to get him outside more, his family bought him a car valeting set for Christmas and he used his kit to clean relative’s cars, being paid £ each time. Eventually, the schoolboy askedhe could clean neighbour’s vehicles.His mum, Jo Ditchett, put a post in a local Facebook group explaining Zykiah’s love of cleaning cars.She asked anyone who wanted their car cleaning to leave their vehicle outside the family home. Just hours after the post went live, cars lined the quiet street as dozens turned out to show their support. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News , Jo, , said: “We had a queue of cars down the close and down the next street. “Everyone jumped on and supported him. He did it that well they asked to come back. “He was charging a fiver but everyone was giving him £.” It didn’t take long for a local businessman to offer Zykiah a permanent base to work from. Jason from Coal and Cotton Gin Bar reached out to the family saying they were “really impressed” by his work. They offered him a canopy outside the venue at weekends to clean local cars. Two years on, Zykiah, now aged , runs his own social media accounts and website.The youngster now cleans for the likes of huge stars including former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Love Island couple Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury, and United footballer Scott McTominay.

He’s done it all online and designed his own flyers. “A lot of young lads message him asking how he started and he says with a bucket and sponge. “He had a bucket and sponge for the whole year before he knew how to use a valeting kit.“He went on Instagram, YouTube, any channel he could to watch the process.” Zykiah’s business, called DirtClean Manchester, charges £ for an outside and winter washes, mini valets for £, full valets for £ and king valets for £.One day, the year  pupil hopes to one day own a car valeting company in his own name and aims to have branches across the UK.

Gordon Allen, , was rushed to Salford Royal in an air ambulance in  after suffering an asthma attack, but when doctors saw his chest they did further tests. He said he couldnapost believe it when he got his diagnosis of stage two breast cancer. At the time Gordon was  and says there was little information out there on male breast cancer.He told the Manchester Evening News his boss even questioned it until he saw paperwork.Gordon, from Swinton, Manchester, is now speaking out about his diagnosis in a bid to make men aware that it can happen to them as well as women.He is speaking out as part of the Men Get Breast Cancer Too campaign from charity Walk the Walk this male breast cancer awareness week. Eight months before his asthma attack, Gordon, who has one daughter with his we Jayne, noticed changes to his left nipple. He felt pain, it had inverted and it had begun to crumble. “I didn’t go to the doctors to get it checked,” he told the Manchester Evening News. “I thought it looked odd, particularly when it went hard and started to flake. “But there was no publicity back then, it was the last thing I thought it was. “It might seem strange but I never knew men could get it and so it never occurred to me that’s what it was.” Despite being fit to go home from the hospital a few days later following his asthma attack, Gordon was aware something wasn’t right when they made him stay. He underwent a mammogram and biopsy and was then told the shocking news. “Once I got to the hospital, they took one look at my chest and hit the roof,” Gordon said. “They weren’t saying a great deal to me but my sister was an orderly nurse at the hospital – she did a bit of asking around for me and I got the impression from her that there was potentially something serious going on with my breast. “When they eventually told me, I couldn’t believe it. But I felt fairly calm about it.” Gordon credits this outlook to his Christian faith, feeling that it was up to God whether he lived or not, as well as a male nurse that helped him. “When everyone had left, I couldn’t help but just stare at the ceiling, I couldn’t get my head around it. “But this wonderful male nurse came and said to me, ‘well you know what it is now, the next thing is treatment.’ “And I thought, ‘he’s right. There’s no point getting all worked up, let’s get on with it and seewe can get it dealt with’.” Gordonaposs close friends and family were supportive of what he was facing but he says he felt stigma over his condition from his boss in the motor trade. Within  days of being diagnosed, he had a mastectomy to remove his breast and had to have time off from his job. “I hadn’t worked there very long which didn’t help,” Gordon continued. “He wouldn’t [his boss] believe it until I brought the paperwork in. He questioned, ‘you’ve got breast cancer  Men don’t get breast cancer. I’ve never heard of that’. “And then when I went back to work after my breast op, he never spoke to me again. Just passed by me and never talked to me.” Gordon didn’t need chemotherapy or radiotherapy and recovered well from the surgery, however was put on hormone therapy Tamoxen. In the months to follow, Gordon learnt the reality of how rare it was to have breast cancer as a man, and still to this day hasn’t met another man in person with the same condition. In the UK, around  men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and around  of these men will die each year. That’s almost a quarter at  per cent. As with women, it usually affects older men aged  and above, however it can be found in men of any age, like Gordon in his mid-forties, who also has no history of breast cancer in his family. When he would attend routine GP appointments to check how he was doing on the treatment, he found he caught the attention of student doctors, who would come into his appointments often. “You wouldn’t believe the amount of these doctors, five years in training, that didn’t have a clue what it was, they didn’t realise it was breast cancer, Gordon said. Gordon felt like a ‘guinea pig’ at times, as he was one of the first men to go on the hormone therapy. His we argues that it caused him to have mood swings at certain times of the month, similarly to PMT - premenstrual syndrome - when he first started out. And after seven years, he was able to come off it, though Gordon found this ‘frightening’. “It was a crutch in a way, so it was quite scary coming off it,” he said. “I thought that was going to protect me. It was down to my body then, no more medicine, which was rather frightening.” Whilst Gordon came off medication for the cancer, he was still on antidepressants as he battled with the aftershock of what had happened to him. Ever since the trauma, he’s regularly checked his remaining breast and around his scar, and encourages other men to do the same. Looking back, Gordon believes he’s lucky to be alive. He added: “I was lucky because I did nothing about it and it was just a bit of luck with the asthma attack. “I can’t believe how daft I was and blasé that I didn’t do anything about it. If I was left to my own devices I would have died, no question. “I want to get the message over to many men as possible that you can get breast cancer and also for men going through it, it’s not necessarily a death sentence. “Any change at all, get to the doctors immediately, don’t mess around”.To find out more about Walk the Walk’s awareness campaign, go to www.walkthewalk.org mengetbreastcancertoo.Comment MORE ON HospitalsBreast cancerTherapyCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This took a huge toll on himself and his family, and Sordell believes lack of enforcement means racists have become more brazen knowing the risk of punishment is low. He said this could lead to a tragedyit is not addressed, stating: We shouldnapost have to wait until it happens until we act. In just two years the number of allegations of social media racism to  police forces in England and Wales soared by  per cent, with , in  alone. Figures released by  forces - the Met, Northumbria, Staffordshire, Surrey, Humberside Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Leicestershire, Cambridgeshire and Cleveland - show they had only charged  people between  and  despite receiving more than , complaints.  Sordell, now , said: Itaposs pretty clear to see that people can make whatever comments they want because they know that the likelihood of them being a found and b charged are very rare.If you think about the number of cases where people have faced consequences, you could probably Google them and name them all, which is pretty telling considering how much abuse is sent. In August the former Watford, Burnley and Bolton striker told a select committee of MPs that dealing with racism directed at players is not being treated as a priority.Iaposve been racially abused, Iaposve had death threats, Iaposve had threats of dferent kinds, he told The Mirror. At times it can be easier to deal with than others. One of the things that gets forgotten is that we all have families and friends who are on social media and they see it as well. Having to navigate that isnapost necessarily always taken into account. People see finances as a protection against reality, but itaposs not, reality is reality.  He echoed a warning by former England star Anton Ferdinand, who warned that abuse could lead to a player taking their own le. People donapost take into account how traumatic being on the end of any kind of abuse, particularly racist abuse, is - itaposs not something that should be taken lightly, Sordell said. When you say someone might take their own le, some might say itaposs not that serious, but thataposs always the case. We shouldnapost have to wait until it happens until we act.The former Premier League star, who now runs a production company and works as a public speaker and writer, has done a lot of advocacy work around mental health, having struggled with depression for many years.He said that educating offenders should be a key element of tackling online abuse.  Racism has been in football for as long as Iaposve known, and as long as the previous generation have known, but itaposs found a new medium, he said. We talk about kicking racism out, but all weaposve done is moved it to a dferent place. Sordell believes social networks need to step up and work with authorities to ensure those who post racist and abusive messages are punished. The fact is that every social media company has the IP address even without having the data on the iniduals they know where they are, he said. They have that capability. Nevertheless the former striker said he would receive hateful messages from accounts with peopleaposs real names on them.  Itaposs an alarm bell of where we are, he stated. It shows people feel like itaposs fine to do so, they donapost feel like theyaposre going to be punished. He believes every social network should very those who set up an account, eventheir real name is not visible on their profile. Sordell said: If I reported them to the police, the police should be able to find out who they are. The issue isnapost me being able to see their name, itaposs about them being held to account. Social media companies have faced mounting calls to act in recent months, with football clubs staging a boycott earlier this year and widespread condemnation of racism directed at Three Lions stars Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka following the Euro  final. But Sordell said it is far too early to tellthis will cause a lasting impact.  Earlier this year fellow former Premier League star Anton Ferdinand told a Parliamentary select committee: My worry is what are the social media companies waiting for  Are they waiting for a high-profile footballer to kill themselves, or a member of their family to commit suicide. Is that what they are waiting for  Becausethat is what they are waiting for, that is too late. Letaposs deal with the issue now. The -year-old added that companies should use technology to identy inappropriate tweets before they are sent out, and talked about the need for an account owneraposs identity to be known, at least to the companies themselves. They donapost want to implement technology becauseI retweet a racist tweet that has been put my way, the frenzy around it is monetary to them, he said.The Mirror sent a list of questions to Facebook, asking for a breakdown of the number of racism complaints it had received, and the number of times it had provided details to police.The network says it is being proactive, removing more than  million pieces of hate speech content,  per cent before they were reported, and says incidents have falling slightly in the first three months of the year. It says it responds to valid legal requests for information from police, and is working with police chiefs to improve co-operation. A spokesperson said: “No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don’t want it on Facebook or Instagram. We share the goal of holding people who share this content to account and we do this by taking action on content and accounts that break our rules and working with the police.We respond to valid legal requests for information as quickly as possible, and are confident that the information we provide is helpful to police investigations. We also encourage people to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we’re committed to keeping our community safe from abuse.”A Twitter spokesperson said the company aposdoes not tolerate abuse or harassment of people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, caste, disability or diseaseapos.The social media giant says it removes content that violates itaposs rules, which includes aposdehumanising languageapos, aposhateful imagery and emojisapos. Twitter has rules in place to address threats of violence, abuse and harassment and stressed it takes action when it finds accounts that violate them. However the spokesperson added that technology alone isnapost enough to solve the issue so they work with other organsiations to tackle racism and regularly meet with the Met Police.Anyone who wants to report violations can do so here https:help en forms law-enforcement Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON GooglePremier LeagueMarvin SordellEngland Under-sRacism\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The woman, a TikTok user, shared her experience in a video where she told about customersapos behaviour and how they would leave the fitting rooms wearing new items theyaposd just picked up on the shop floor.The social media user @kdr from London explained how shoppers would abandon their old clothes and swap them for new ones in the changing rooms.They would hand their old outfit, including dirty underwear to the shop assistant. She rolls her eyes in the TikTok video and said: When people handed in their own clothes to the fitting room and left wearing new ones from Primark when I worked there. She adds that there is a bonus point when it was their underwear. Her confessions prompted other Primark employees to recall their gross experiences while working for the budget clothes chain. One wrote I found a used sanitary towel stuck to the mirror when I checked the fitting rooms. Another posted an emoji of a man vacuuming which read: Me when I worked in Primark and a toddler p***** on the floor three minutes before the end of my sht. A third response claimed customers had disgusting behaviour: Someone pooped in a bag on my sht and left it there. One admitted she had handed their old clothes back to the shop assistant before walking out with her new clothes.  They said: -year-old me thought I was slick wearing old black jeans in and new black jeans out. But Georgia Ponton, , from Kettering, revealed how to benefit from free hanger and seasonal items in her TikTok post. In her response, she says: aposIf you go up to someone that is working on the till and say aposCan I have a bag of hangers apos then they will give it to you, she said. So stop buying hangers because you can get them for free. She suggested the best products were positioned at the back of the rails especially during changing seasons.  She said: aposCheck the back of all the rails. If the season was about to change, then we would put anything that needed to be sold right at the front and anything new at the back because we needed to prioritise the old stuff. Poleighh Soper, a former worker said when a request for Mr Brown comes over the tannoy, it is a call for security. She said: Say your security company that stands by the door and makes sure nobody is stealing… say their name is like aposBrown Security Servicesapos, thataposs who theyaposre calling. So, when they say aposCan Mr Brown please come to the customer service checkoutapos, theyaposre actually calling for security – they just donapost want the customers to know that. Staff would have to carry out theft checks at the tills according to the former worker.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

KFC is doing just that by encouraging people to spice things up to mark the launch of its tasty new Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only. So to join in the fun, weaposre championing people who have challenged themselves to try new things, including Jenny Holden who has ed head first into wild swimming. The forty-seven-year-old mum of ten-year-old twins from Lichfield, Staffordshire, explains that she was in search of a new challenge, and one that would bring some excitement to her le.  ‘With my children a bit older, and less dependent on me, I found myself with a little bit more time for myself, and I wanted to use it doing something fun,’ says Jenny who runs her own PR company Chorus Communications. ‘Especially post lockdowns, with so much time spent at home, being sedentary and growing bored of my normal activities, I was craving a new hobby, and one that would really exhilarate me.’ A friend suggested Jenny try wild swimming at a quarry near her home and Jenny decided to give it a go, albeit with some nerves. ‘I’m a keen swimmer but the idea of swimming in that sort of environment was completely new to me. Also, wouldn’t it be freezing  I was intrigued enough to give it a go though, and took my first dip in August with one of my sons. ‘Plunging into the water, my first thought was – wow it’s cold! But actually, once you become acclimatised to the water temperature it feels wonderful. That first swim was really memorable, I came out of the water feeling revived and invigorated, and I knew I was a convert.’ Jenny persuaded three friends to form a wild swim gang with her and since August they have met weekly for a dip. ‘I don’t wear a wetsuit, it’s too much faff getting in and out of one, just a swimsuit and now I look forward to my swim all week. ‘Front crawling through open water, surrounded by the sounds and sights nature, it’s so amazing and it washes away the stresses of the week. It’s nothing like swimming in a pool, it’s both exciting and soothing, brilliant for body and mind. ‘It’s definitely going to get a bit nippier as we go into winter but I’m ready for the challenge!’ So in the spirit of taking the plunge and trying something new, e into a Zinger Popcorn Bucket soon - it is only around for a limited period, available until November .Download the app, head in store or order online.

The Manchester Evening News sent feature writer Dianne Bourneaposs visit to Manchester Britannia Hotel, to give her personal verdict on whether Britannia rules or not.Hereaposs what she had to stay about her stay:  Iaposm not quite sure where to start with my visit to Manchesteraposs Britannia Hotel. With the ONE HOUR queue to check in  With the bedroom without a window, stuffy and sweltering with an ageing air con that I couldnapost get to work  Or perhaps with the eye-watering £ price for it all  Not forgetting, of course, the people who kindly woke me at .am by screaming in the hotel corridors at the injustice of it all  So, anyway, when I got my booking information through for the Britannia I was surprised to see that check-in was from pm - which seemed a little late - but I figured that would still give me time to get ready ahead of the event I was attending at pm. I arrived at bang on pm at the Britannia, and my heart sank when I saw a queue already forming outside of the grand double doors for check-in. Waiting around does allow you to appreciate the grandeur of this th century building - the sweeping staircase and huge chandelier on entrance really are impressive, while Graeco-Roman style statues dot the alcoves and windows around the lobby.  However I became sick of the sight of the Roman Gods after staring at them for a FULL HOUR while waiting to get to the front of the queue. I got chatting to some nice people next to me in the queue - when I overheard them talking about how much they had paid for their room. And then they all got to have a good laugh when I told them how much I was paying. Because it turns out I was being well and truly ripped off with the £ charge - the two women from Scotland revealed theyaposd booked their double roomfor £ just three days before their stay .  A couple originally from South America revealed they were paying £ for their double. To say I felt ripped off at this stage would be an understatement. When I told them all my room was £ with NO WINDOW I honestly think they thought I was joking. Ah, you will be in the penthouse for that price, they said. No no, itaposs a room with no window, I tried to explain, but still they laughed. Finally, finally when I got to the check-in desk, there was no apology or explanation for the delay, just the request for my name.  Does it always take this long  I asked. And he reckoned it was just because it was a busy Saturday night in Manchester. Although when I later looked on TripAdvisor, I can see there have been numerous complaints about the hour-long check-ins for weeks now. I felt annoyed that it gave me less than an hour to get myself showered and ready to get to my event. But I felt even more annoyed on behalf of some shirtless males I encountered in the corridors as I made my way to my room.  They were very apologetic about their state of undress and the contents of their luggage all over the floor, but explained to me they needed to get changed quickly as they were already late for an event and just couldnapost wait any longer in the ridiculous queue for check-in. Itaposs just not on to pay for a hotel room and then not even be able to get into it, is it  I arrived at my room, having noted that room numbers on the doors were in a font that might best be described as Prisoner Cell Block H. Once inside my ground floor bedroom, the first thing that struck me was the wave of heat. Yes, I knew there was no window when I booked, but I had foolishly thought this would be in some way compensated by a modern form of air conditioning system. No such luck. An ancient looking grid was high on the wall, with a silver switch control  that was not exactly screaming digital age at me. While a little blue light flickered on the temperature setting, no such light was emerging from the fan switch. I tried and tried but nothing happened. Naturally, my first thought was to ring reception, but, funnily enough, given the fact there was still a queue out of the door at check in, there was no answer. And there was no way in hell I was going back out to queue for another hour to speak to someone. Aside from the heat, the room itself was pretty basic with old-fashioned dark furniture, and plain magnolia walls punctuated by two dirty round marks above the bedhead. But the bedding all looked clean and the bed itself felt comfy.  The TV remote was wrapped in a film with a sanitised sticker on it, and coffee and teas were also wrapped in a bag next to the kettle and cups to keep them clean. Above the skirting board appeared to be the power mains switches with the warning sign Danger  volts above it, which I found a little unsettling. The bathroom also looked to be clean, although when I touched pretty much anything in the shower it fell off in my hands - the soap dispenser, the shower power control and temperature ring. I mean, I was able to put them straight back on again so they all still ed ok, but not exactly the Ritz levels of quality is it  I was getting so hot now in the room that I thought Iaposd best just get cleaned up and changed as quickly as I could to get out into some fresh air.  When I ed to the hotel after attending my event, there was at least a blessing that the temperature had dropped outside by a few degrees so the heat of the bedroom was not quite as unbearable - although my flannel pyjamas were certainly not required for the sleep. Well, I say sleep. I was rudely awakened just after am by loud banging and crashing in the corridor, and a chap who sounded rather upset, presumably, having finally managed to check in to his room. He was shouting: I f***ing paid £... for THIS . Which I might have had some sympathy for, had I not forked out £... for THIS.  I settled back to sleep, only to be woken again around an hour later at .am by what sounded like a crowd disturbance on the street outside - not having a window I was unable to check what exactly it was that was happening. All that said, the bed was comfy and after the noisy interruptions it was a comfortable sleep. Waking at am I headed off to reception to complain about the heat of the room and the air conditioning not working. The man at the front desk said immediately would you like a plug-in fan  which gave me the impression I was not the first person to make this complaint. No, itaposs not worth it now I said. But I made the point they might want their hotel technical team to take a look at it so the next person doesnapost have to suffer in there. Heading down to Jennyaposs Restaurant in the basement for my buffet breakfast was perhaps the highlight of my stay.  Fine dining it ainapost, but the good old-fashioned all-you-can-eat fry up buffet was plentulyou were after a cooked breakfast - and there was quite a pile of fresh fruit too. I mean, donapost get me wrong, the sausage was like a salty fat stick and the mushrooms looked like theyaposd long ceased their status as vegetable, but it gets major brownie points for hosting what for me is the holy grail of hotel breakfasts - limitless fried bread. However, I could not forgive the god-awful coffee which tasted unlike any hot liquid I think Iaposve ever drunk before. Perhaps I picked the wrong jug of badly-brewed stuff, but I was not going to go and try another. Mercully, there was no queuing for check out, as you just popped your room key in a box on your way out. And, seeing the lobby empty, you can appreciate what a grand old building this really is, and what poteI couldnapost help but notice the one thing definitely not in short supply at the Britannia was racks and racks stuffed with postcards of the grand old building, all around the reception, should you wish to send a reminder to a loved one of your stay.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Wish you were here  Erm, not so much no. We have asked Britannia Hotels for comment about the pricing scale for rooms, and the issues raised at my stay with check-in and the air conditioning, but there was no reply at the time of publishing. My overall take away from this stay is just the sheer rip off of the pricing. The windowless room is not the worst hotel room Iaposve ever stayed in here in Manchester but itaposs the one I felt most ripped off in. If you get this style of room at a budget price, then it offers reasonable accommodationyou just need somewhere to bed down for a few hours and shower . But for the £ paid for my visit, Iaposd have been better off booking a taxi to get me home - heck I could probably have got a chauffeur-driven limo for that price.

Two evacuation flights arrived in the UK carrying Afghans and British nationals, the Ministry of Defencesaid. While repatriation flights and inidual relocations have been taking place since the end of August, the two airlts were the first military relocations since the end of the evacuation from Kabul, known as Operation Pitting. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: In August we worked tirelessly to airlt more than , vulnerable Afghans and British nationals from Kabul to the UK. As I made clear at the time, our commitment to the Afghan people did not end there. We are determined to do right by those who supported our Armed Forces for so many years and others who are at risk. These flights mark the beginning of what will be an enduring effort to relocate and support those who need our help. The MoD said more than  people had left Afghanistan from the unnamed third country across two flights, which have both now landed in the UK.  The department said those on board - vulnerable Afghans who fall under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policywho are eligible for relocation to the UK, and British nationals - will now receive supportneeded. Further flights are also due to arrive in the UK in the coming weeks with more eligible people on board. Trump arranged the US withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in May  this year and the Biden administration has blamed him for putting in place the timescale for leaving.Former US president Donald Trump agreed the withdrawal of US troops and defended his actions by saying that it was on his terms and he was tough in the negotiations. The Mirror told in August how chaotic scenes followed in the Afghan capital as opponents of the Taliban desperately sought to leave the country via the airport.President Biden was also criticised for a poorly organised withdrawal. It was then claimed that lives could be put at risk for interpreters and other people who helped Western countries but have not been able to leave in time.  And earlier this month campaigners claimed interpreters left behind after Britain’s withdrawal from Afghanistan had not been been evacuated. Up to  translators, British embassy support staff and families face being executed or imprisoned by the Taliban government. Many are now in hiding and begging for food and money from family and friends.Terried interpreters told the Mirro r they had been abandoned by the UK. Dad-of-four Aleem then said: “We left Kandahar for Kabul when the Taliban came. The British embassy said they would get my family out. “But in the chaos we couldn’t get to the airport. I haven’t heard anything since. We have sold all of our jewellery to buy food, now we’re selling our clothes. I am hiding in a cellar with my family. The Taliban are everywhere, constantly checking for anyone who worked for foreign governments.” Comment MORE ON Ben WallaceMinistry of DefenceAfghanistan\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chantelle Welsh kept quiet about the appalling incident for several hours before taking the little boy to hospital but repeatedly lied about how he had been injured - which led to her own brothers falling under suspicion and being detained in custody.The tot’s horrying catalogue of injuries included complex skull fractures, multiple eye socket fractures as well as a broken right arm and left leg, reported the Liverpool Echo. Liverpool Crown Court heard that the -month-old had “a large boggy swelling” to his head which he needed emergency surgery to reduce. He was discharged from Alder Hey Hospital after ten days and has fortunately physically recovered but there are concerns he may suffer psychologically in the long term. Welsh, , also has an older son but both have since been taken off her. The court heard that the defendant, who is now pregnant by another man, is unlikely to ever get her sons back and social services are involved in her le.  Welsh, of St Domingo Vale, Anfield, had pleaded guilty to child neglect involving failing to get medical help for the victim. Jailing her for  months Judge Garrett Byrne said: “A doctor refers to the injuries as would be seen in a serious car crash. “It is impossible to determine the long term psychological effect this trauma will have on this child, all one can say is there is the potential for long term psychological harm.” He told Welsh, who was dressed completely in baby pink, that her limited cognitive ability reduced her culpability but said the aggravating factors were “the time you took to seek medical attention and the lies told to the professionals which resulted in innocent people being arrested and detained, namely your brothers. Judge Byrne said it was “a shocking case” and she had “told a pack of lies” and it was only three months later that she started telling the truth. He said he had consideredhe could suspend the sentence on Welsh, who has no previous convictions, “but simply it was so serious only immediate sentence of custody can be justied.” John Williams, prosecuting, said that on the afternoon of February  last year the boy was taken to hospital by Welsh and her then partner. The baby had signicant swelling to his right eye which was completely closed and when examined he was found to have multiple injuries.  He listed the fractures the child had suffered as well as a perforated right ear drum and bruising to his right flank and abdomen. “There was no reasonable explanation as to how he had suffered these extensive injuries. “Neither she nor her partner were able to provide any explanation for the injuries. The nature and location of the injuries was such that clinicians rapidly concluded they were non-accidental and were indicative of signicant abuse.” Mr Williams said that the medics also concluded that the injuries had been caused on the day he was presented at hospital. The police and social services were notied and Welsh was questioned in the early hours of the next morning at hospital. She said she was unable to understand how he had suffered such injuries and he had not complained. It was only when she gave him paracetamol as he was hot that she and her mum realised his arm was floppy and decided to take him to hospital. Her two brothers, who lived in the same house as Welsh, were arrested as potential perpetrators as was her partner, who had not stayed at the hospital. The brothers were “detained for a signicant period of time. “ She was not in a relationship with the father of either of her sons and had only recently formed a relationship with the boyfriend. He did not live with her but he had been there overnight February  last year.  When interviewed she denied that her partner or brothers were involved in causing the injuries. Mr Williams said that the brothers were entirely innocent but she had lied about the partner. In family court proceedings which ran alongside the criminal proceedings Welsh admitted that her partner had inflicted the injuries. In an impact statement the victim’s paternal grandmother said the telephone call telling her about his injuries was “the worst news in the family’s le.” She said that the child, who the court heard had gone through a period of self-harming, was “more loved than he could ever want to be” and described the bond he has with her, his grandfather and his dad as “amazing.” Martine Snowdon, defending, said, “Her criminality flows from what happened after the infliction of these injuries. Her culpability is failing to act appropriately since she witnessed it.” She took him to hospital after a delay of about three hours and there is no evidence of any exacerbation of his physical condition as a result of the delay.” Miss Snowdon said that she knew her partner “had some involvement in crime and believed it to be drugs. He recently had a domestic violence conviction but she says she had no awareness of that”. Her telephone messages to him showed her immaturity with her telling him she loved him but no response from him. She had no awareness of the domestic violence background at the time he was in the bedroom with her and the injuries occurred. Miss Snowdon said no one would have known what had gone on in the bedroomshe had not gone on to tell the truth. She said: “She made a terrible mistake and she is deeply remorseful. She is deeply regretful of what she did. “She has spent approaching two years coming to terms that she is not getting these children back, probably for ever, and certainly for the foreseeable future.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Alder Hey hospitalCourt caseSocial servicesCrimeDomestic violence\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The National Police Chiefsapos Councilsaid there have been  confirmed reports of drink spiking in September and October across ious parts of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, plus  reports of some form of injection. On Friday afternoon, the NPCC said there were around  confirmed reports of drink spiking, but this figure was revised after more data was received. It said the number included both men and women, although the majority of cases featured young women. Alleged offences have taken place at licensed premises and private parties.Have you been a spiking victim  Tell us your story at webnews@mirror The  figure is based on data received from  police forces, and the NPCC said it is still to receive data from five forces which it expects over the weekend. The NPCC said  of the  reports of drink spiking were made to the politan Police. The NPCC lead for drugs, Deputy Chief Constable Jason Harwin, said: Clearly these reports are very concerning. We are working at pace with forces, law enforcement agencies such as the NCA and other partners including the Home Office and universities to understand the scale of offending, establish any links between the allegations and ultimately bring any identied offenders to justice. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to administer poison in connection with a spate of reported drink-spiking incidents involving needles in Nottingham. Nottinghamshire Police said the men, aged  and , were arrested after receiving information from a member of the public on Wednesday, following a general appeal for help from a senior officer. The force said both had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison with intent to injure, annoy or aggrieve, and placed in police custody. The arrests are not being linked to any specic allegation of spiking by a needle, or contamination of a drink. Both men have since been released under investigation, the force said in an update. Nottinghamshire Police said it will deploy extra officers to ensure people can enjoy a safe night out. Miranda AriehMiranda Arieh, , thought she was going to die when her drink was spiked at a nightclub in Leeds.The mum-of-one had gone into the smoking area, only to be told by a bouncer to leave her drink on a ledge while she was outside. When she ed she took her drink back and drank about two-thirds before realising something was wrong, before dropping to the ground. “I just remember being so cold, and being so scared, and my head just collapsed between my knees, she told the Mirror. I had accepted I was going to die there. Miranda said she was discouraged from speaking to police, and believes victims need avenues to go where they feel safe. Katie Brady Katie Brady blacked out after being spiked while dancing at a nightclub in Newcastle.The mum, , from Gateshead, kept placing her drink on a podium but can remember nothing after the incident.She told Chronicle Live : I was told afterward that I had gone to the toilets and the door staff had to carry me out and give me water.[They said that] my eyes had rolled back into my head and that later on, I had just walked away from the bar. She was able to contact a taxi driver she knows and was taken home but fell backwards while being sick in her bathroom. Ilana El-baz University student Ilana El-baz was filmed lying completely paralysed on a staircase after her drink was spiked while on a night out in Bristol.Shocking images show the -year-old in a dficult state after she ed home and struggled to get up a flight of stairs while her eyes rolled and her head slumped on to the bannister. She says that she was spiked and has called on clubs to do more to protect revellers, including using lids on drinks, like with takeaway coffees, to protect clubbers.In an interview with the BBC, with whom she shared the footage, she said: Looking back on it, this guy spiked me and the moment I told him aposoh, Iaposm with my boyfriendapos he asked meI wanted to dance with him, and the moment I was like aposIaposm with my boyfriendapos he left me completely.And like an hour later I went back home and it hit and I was completely paralysed. Zara OwenTeenager Zara Owen was spiked with an injection and has shared her horrendous experience of waking up confused with no memory of the night out.Last Monday, the University of Nottingham student, , from Surrey, was out at a club with friends but has no memory after getting a drink at the bar. Speaking to the Mirror, Zara said: When it hit me I had been spiked, I was so shocked to realise this had happened to me as I take the safety measures given very seriously. I cover my glasses and I cover my bottles to make sure nothing goes in, but to realise I had been injected is terrying. After speaking to her friends, they informed her that she had been acting out of character, not making any sense and wandering off alone and after finding her outside pals got her in a taxi home. The next morning, she was shocked to find a pin-prick after examining her leg properly - but is still waiting to see her GP after being left to wait eight hours in AE before giving up and going home.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON West Yorkshire PoliceNottinghamshire PoliceHome Officepolitan PoliceCCTVHospitalsCCTV footageCrimeAlcohol\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Having been with the Duke since university, Kate had become accustomed to the conventions and around being a Royal, including a key rule the family lives by - never complain, never explain. The idea is that members of The Firm keep their personal matters quiet and put on a happy face in public, even when times are tough. And Kate has been no exception since joining, flashing her trademark stunning smile while carrying out royal duties in public and winning the hearts of the nation in the process. However, over the years, there have been rare flashes of more candid moments from The Duchess of Cambridge. In , while she was five months pregnant with Princess Charlotte, Kate travelled to New York with Wills, where she visited a childrenaposs centre to help the wrap Christmas presents. During the visit, she stopped wrapping for a moment to chat to some of the volunteers about their work - but was given a telling-off. Kate was told to keep wrapping, at which point she showed a cheeky, light-hearted glimpse of what she was really thinking. Going back to wrapping and doing what she was told, Kate rolled her eyes. But she diligently carried out the work as asked and continued wrapping the presents. As she finished her visit to the centre, Kate is said to have thoroughly enjoyed her day - despite the funny reaction she expressed earlier. Sheaposs not the only royal to have lost her cool in the past, with a few funny incidents showing members of the royal family showing their true feelings. Just last week, The Queen expressed her frustration at world leaders who havenapost fully committed to attending the COP summit in Glasgow in November. Her Majesty said it was irritating to see some leaders appearing to not take their responsibility seriously when it comes to reversing the effects of climate change. And itaposs not just the adults who let their true feelings slip in public - with the next generation of royals expressing their anger too. While visiting Hamburg with her parents in , Princess Charlotte, then two, had a classic toddler meltdown on the tarmac at the airport. As William took a book from Charlotte that her brother had been given as a gt, she stamped her feet and got on the floor, just like any other tot in a bad mood. Luckily, mum Kate was on hand to scoop up her daughter before her antics turned into a full-blown tantrum.

Guillain-Barre syndrome is a condition that has been noted in some people that have had the AstraZaneca jab, although experts insist the benefits of the Covid vaccine outweigh any possible side effects, The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas added Guillain-Barre syndrome as a possible side effect of the vaccine. The disorder affects the nerves mainly in the feet, hands and limbs, states the NHS. Numbness, pain or weakness can all be felt in patients with the condition which affects the immune system. For most people they will be treated and have a complete recovery but on rare occasions it can to lead to long term illness and may even be le-threatening.  Guillain-Barre syndrome had already been added to the side effects to the vaccine last month by the European Medicines Agency. Put in context, as of July  there had been  cases of the syndrome from million AstraZeneca doses given. Prof Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King’s College London, has said that the most common side effect of the AstraZeneca jab is a headache and then comes tiredness. He is a lead researcher on the ZOE Covid study that examines symptoms of Covid and side effects of vaccines. Prof Spector used data from app users to compile his list of common side effects.  He tweeted that one in five people statistically feel unwell after having a vaccine dose with younger people more so which is believed to be because their immune system is stronger. Chills and joint pain were also typical side effects that were found after taking the AstraZeneca, the Pfizer or the Moderna jabs. For the Pfizer and Moderna jabs the most common side effect, according to Prof Spector, was tiredness followed by a headache.

Snus – pronounced “snoose” – is made from ground-up leaves packed into a pouch, which is placed under the top lip. Football managers have warned its use is on the rise among professional players, who use it as a stimulant. And while it is “safer” than smoking, experts say snus is highly addictive – and has links to head and neck cancer, receding gums and burn-like mouth lesions.A Sunday People probe found scores of youngsters raving about it on TikTok.One video shows a girl in school ­unorm, seen with her friends holding tins, captioned, “What snus have everyone got today ” Another clip refers to “opening the snus can at school”.  The use of snus is not illegal, but it has been banned from sale in the UK and European Union for  years – except in Sweden. It can also be bought online with no age checks other than an over- tick box. One “extra strong” tin, available for £, contains  pouches with around mg of nicotine each – one and a half times that of a cigarette. The Sunday People also found sellers flogging snus on TikTok, along with a video offering tips for new users. Dozens of other profiles show UK youngsters taking snus, although their ages are unclear. Many refer to use by footballers. In May, one mum told how her -year-old son was hospitalised after taking snus at his school in Treorchy, South Wales. She said: “The children pop these sachets at the top of their mouth and it’s supposed to give them a head rush. My son stupidly took part in this craze and had an adverse reaction. “He was violently sick, eyes rolling, couldn’t hold his head upright… along with losing feeling in his arms and legs.” The mum said doctors were unsureher son’s medication gave him the bad reaction, but urged other parents to let their children know the dangers. Another parent said she was “shocked and upset” to find a tin of snus in her son’s bedroom. After researching the risks, the woman said she “burst into tears”. Writing on Mumsnet, she said: “I don’t know who put the idea in his head as it’s not readily available in the UK.”  Sunderland manager Lee Johnson said last month that snus is a “big, big problem in football” and “very detrimental to ­development and performance”. And Joey Barton told how on his first day as Bristol Rovers manager, he found  pouches spat out on the training pitch. Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy revealed in his  autobiography he had used it. Experts led by Prof David Nutt – chair of the scientic committee for independent campaign group, Drug Science – want snus legalised, saying research found it signicantly less harmful than cigarettes. Health minister Jo Churchill told MPs in June it was “under review”. Alice Davies, of Cancer Research UK, said: “The jury’s still out on whether it causes cancer but snus is highly addictive.” TikTok said: “We do not allow the trade of tobacco. Our teams have reviewed the content and are removing videos and ­accounts that violate our guidelines.” Comment MORE ON Cancer Research UKSchoolsSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One viral tweet shared by a Tesco customer showed a cardboard image of asparagus placed where the actual vegetable should be. The tweet was captioned: Tesco have the fake asparagus out this morning. From afar, it could appear that the store had a full supply of the vegetable, but on approach, youaposd be disappointed. A Sainsburyaposs shopper replied to the tweet with a bizarre picture of her own. The woman shared a snap from inside a Sainsburyaposs store in Sherborne, saying that the supermarket was not even trying to make it look genuine.  The photograph, shared by Sharon Dale, showed empty pasta shelves at theLudbourne Road shop, with some of them filled with a cardboard insert.One person replied: Is dried pasta out of season too Speaking to Dorset Live, Sharon said she felt it drew attention to the lack of stock.She said: I have been reading a lot of comments about empty shelves and the cause .She said: I have been reading a lot of comments about empty shelves and the cause .  I thought it was a strange choice. I am already in Sainsbury’s so don’t need branded reminders. It draws attention to the lack of stockanything. A Sainsburyaposs spokesperson told The Mirror: Our colleagues and suppliers are working hard to make sure customers can find everything they need when they shop with us. Availability in some product categories may y but alternatives are available and stores continue to receive deliveries daily. The Mirror also contacted Tesco for comment.  It comes as a lack of lorry drivers and Brexit-related complications have caused queues at petrol stations and empty shelves in parts of the UK, while Felixstowe and other big ports around the world have suffered backlogs. As a result of the supply problems, the Department for Transportannounced plans to lt the limit on the number of deliveries foreign lorry drivers can make in the UK for up to six months. Currently, hauliers from the EU can only make up to two trips to drop off or pick up goods between locations in the UK within one week. Under the DfT proposal, there would be no restriction on the number of those journeys foreign lorry drivers can make over a two-week period before theyto their country of origin. Mr Shapps told Times Radio: “Christmas will go ahead. We’ll be able to see our friends and families. There will be food, there will be gts.“I do know that the entire world has a squeeze on its supply chain. That’s because we’re all coming out of this very long period of coronavirus, and the UK economy, perhaps particularly because we’ve got an expanding economy, the fastest-growing in the G, means that there are particular stresses and strains.“But we’re taking a whole range of measures, including one that I’m announcing today about the way that lorry drivers from abroad pick up and drop things off, the so-called cabotage rules. “And, under our changes, that will mean that they can, in an unlimited way by Christmas, pick up and drop off goods within this country within a -day period.” Comment MORE ON TescoSainsburysCoronavirusSupermarkets\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sean Howarth, , met the victim and her friends at a nightclub in Manchesteraposs Gay Village - repeatedly complimenting her despite her telling him she had a boyfriend. Whilst on the dancefloor he offered one of her friends some cocaine, but she declined and he then offered to buy the group a drink, including the victim, Minshull Street Crown Court heard.After taking the drink, the woman had little recollection of what happened next, the Manchester Evening News reports. Rachel Faux, prosecuting, said: “At am her friend noticed the victim behaving in a strange manner, she was hyper and dancing in an unusual fashion. “The victim then had some sort of panic attack and went outside to vomit, which was unusual for her.  “The friend went back inside the club to retrieve their coats so they could go home and gave the victim her phone.” As she went inside, Howarth headed outside directly for the woman. By the time her friend went to meet her, both Howarth and the victim were gone. Despite calling her she received no reply until the following morning when Howarth called her back on the victim’s phone stating that the victim was with him at his hotel in Rochdale and that she was safe, and sent her back home in a taxi. When the girl arrived back she was ‘shaking and crying’ with no memory of why she ended up in a hotel room, why she was with Howarth, or why she woke up with her trousers half way down her legs. She was also without her phone and bank cards which were kept in her phone case. The following day, police attended at the Royal Toby Hotel, where Howarth was staying, and found class A drugs. The day after he was released on bail and went to a Cash Generator where he sold the victim’s phone for £. He later used this and the stolen money to buy drugs. In a further interview he claimed she had pulled down her own trousers and he began to touch her until he realised she had fallen asleep. CCTV later showed Howarth and the victim walking towards Bloom Street and getting into a taxi. They stopped at a McDonalds where he bought some food but she could be seen ‘slumped’ against the rear window. Pulling up at the hotel, Howarth helped her out of the car as she was unsteady on her feet. He told the night porter that she was his sister, that she was drunk and askedit was OK to bring her inside, the court heard. They felt ‘intimidated’ by Howarth and allowed it, but later witnessed her trying to ‘break free’ from Howarth and heard her saying “no no”. CCTV from inside the hotel showed Howarth carrying the girl over his shoulder to his room, before dropping her to the floor in order for him to retrieve his food he left at reception. As part of the police investigation, Howarth’s phone was seized and examined in the note section was the victim’s passwords and security information and a recording he had taken of himself sexually assaulting her. Following tests, the presence of cocaine was discovered in the victim’s urine, though she had confirmed to officers she did not, and would not take cocaine. In an emotional victim personal statement, the woman said her whole le had changed and she was no longer the ‘bubbly, sociable’ person she once was. She said she no longer goes out socialising with friends for a drink, she has panic attacks when in crowded places and has completely changed jobs. She said she has lost friends as a result, lost her confidence and initially felt like she was to blame for what happened to her. “He left me with so many unanswered questions: Why did he pick on me  How did he think doing something like that was OK ” she said. “It’s clear from his actions that his only priority was himself.” Howarth was said to have two previous convictions for breaching non molestation orders against a former partner. Mitigating, Keith Harrison said: “In his basis of plea, he states he did not seek to stalk anybody. This offence was not planned in the sense of prior to arriving and seeing the complainant. “These offences are totally disrespectful and serious. “He behaved in a totally unacceptable manner. “There are very many good elements to this man - he fell from grace.” Sentencing, Judge John Potter told him: “This offending amounted to a series of planned quite deliberate events leading to the depraved act of sexual assault which you filmed on your mobile phone. “You then stole from your victim’s phone with all the money she had and you then took her mobile phone for yourself. “The selection of your victim by you and thereafter objectying her by dragging her into the hotel room to sexually abuse her and then stealing from her is clear evidence, in my judgement, of predatory sexual offending. “You have, in many respects, destroyed her hopes and expectations she was entitled to have in her young le.” Howarth, of Newsome Road, Huddersfield, was jailed for seven years and two months, made subject of the Sex Offender’s Register for le and also made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order indefinitely. He previously pleaded guilty to administering a substance with intent to commit a sexual offence, sexual assault, offering to supply a class A drug, theft and fraud. Detective Constable Russell Clarke, of Rochdale CID, said: The circumstances of this case are truly shocking and involved the premeditated violation of a young woman. Howarth gave her no consideration as he exploited her in order to satisfy his own sexual and financial greed. He added: Throughout the investigation, Howarth failed to take full responsibility for his predatory behaviour. He changed his story on a number of occasions, spinning a web of lies as he persisted in trying to distance himself from what he had done.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVBanksCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtCrimeCocaine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Landscape designer Rebecca Derbyshire, , was injected with an unknown drug while on a hen do in Liverpool. Rebecca, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, said: “I felt something sharp go into my shoulder. It was a really unusual sensation. “I turned around to my friend and said, ‘I think I’ve just been injected’. She looked at my arm and said there was a needle mark and we looked around trying to see who might have done it. “It doesn’t bear thinking about what could have happenedmy friend hadn’t been there.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  “I think I was targeted when she had stepped away and I was on my own at the bar, making me more vulnerable. Most of my friends had already headed home but thankfully we stuck together.” Rebecca and her friend, who were drinking in the Rubber Soul bar in the city centre on September , went straight back to their hotel as she began to feel sick and drowsy. She said: “I was mainly a bit fuzzy, confused and quite shook up, feeling a bit nauseous and dizzy.” She later had a medical check-up, including HIV and hepatitis tests. Doctors told Rebecca that whoever injected her did not know what they were doing because they missed her blood stream. She said: “The doctors think it was probably muscle relaxants which could have temporarily paralysed me, but we will never really know until we find out who did it.” It was only this week after seeing other victims of needle spiking come forward that Rebecca reported her ordeal to police. Nationwide, cops have reported  needle spiking attacks in the past two months and  cases of drink spiking.  Nottinghamshire police have received  reports this month of people being spiked by something sharp. That includes three within just  hours this week. It coincides with an overall rise in reports of spiking using both needles and drinks this month. Rebecca said: “Afterwards I thought I was being paranoid and going mad, and I tried to put it to the back of my mind. “I think there was an assumption it was just students, but my story shows anyone considered to be an easy target can be attacked.” Two men in Nottingham and one in Lincoln were detained in connection with spiking attacks last weekend. An  and -yearold remain in custody in Nottingham on suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison. It is still unknown exactly what drug is being used to spike victims.  Jo Cox-Brown, founder of Night Time Economy, delivered anti drink spiking training on Friday to Nottingham venues. She said it is crucial to report a spiking to police as soon as possible because date-rape drugs like rohypnol and GHB leave the system within  hours. She said: “The earlier you report it, the more likely the perpetrators can be found immediately.” Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered police to urgently investigate the rise of spiking. More than , people have signed a petition to make it a legal requirement for nightclubs to thoroughly search guests on entry.

Abby Younis, who works as a financial crime consultant, had started to feel aposout of sortsapos in January . Abby, who lives with her husband Brian in Litherland, Merseyside, thought she needed a break to get her back to her old, energetic self.She told the Liverpool Echo : I was working really hard and getting migraines and feeling tired.I just wanted to take some time off to get fit again as normally Iaposm a very energetic and into my fitness but I had put on some weight and couldnapost breathe properly. Taking time off, she caught up with family and friends and booked a once-in-a-letime holiday to Tanzania. However, after ing from holiday she still felt unwell and in constant need of having a wee. She said: I was breathless all the time. I had a lot of pains in my abdomen - at times they were quite paralysing, I couldnapost move. After dismissing it as something Iaposd eaten or time of the month I thought it was time to go to the doctors.  After a visit to her GP, it was suggested her problem may be bladder related and she was sent to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital for tests. Expecting hospital staff to tell her nothing was wrong, Abby was shocked to hear that scans had revealed a mass in her stomach. They didnapost knowthe mass was coming from her oies or bowel and so Abby was sent for further tests at the Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital and the Clatterbridge Centre. Initial results from a CT scan revealed that she had a pulmonary embolism - a blockage in one of the arteries in her lung which explained her breathlessness. Results from further blood test revealed more sinister news as Abby was told by doctors that they suspected the mass in her stomach was cancer. Abby said: It had got quite aggressive by that stage. They said my mass was too big to have a biopsy. The only way to knowit was cancer for sure was to undergo surgery. Following the shock news, doctors raced her appointment for surgery through as quickly as possible as wards were beginning to close due to the pandemic. Abby said: Before I left my home for the hospital, I left it in a way that I wouldnapost come back. Normally Iaposm such a positive person but because of where we were at the time. I thought Iaposve possibly got cancer, I know Iaposve got an embolism, and thereaposs Covid out there. I thoughtmy lungs or my cancer doesnapost get me, then Covid would. I couldnapost see past that moment in time. Three weeks after surgery to remove two masses in her stomach, Abbyaposs consultant called her into the hospital. She said: The consultant said they found something that we were expecting and something that they were not expecting. They had found two separate cancers growing at dferent rates. The more progressed one was oian cancer and that had spread across my bowels. Luckily they scraped off the cancer and didnapost have to remove part of my bowel. And separately I had endometrial cancer growing, which is cancer of the womb. Following Abbyaposs successful surgery to remove the tumours, she was offered chemotherapy which she declined unless they reappear again some time in the future. However, Abbyaposs surgery brought on whataposs known as a surgical menopause. She said: They tell you all the side effects before you have surgery and one of those is menopause - surgical menopause for people like me going through hormonal cancers. But you donapost know what that means, because Iaposve never heard anyone speak about it. Itaposs more of a crash bang wallop rather an easing in to the menopause. I had a lot of sleepless nights, I was in a lot of pain because of the surgery. I had terrible brain fog and hot flushes which were a complete nightmare. It was like somebody throwing a bucket of boiling hot water over me. Because Abbyaposs cancers were hormonal related she wasnapost allowed Hormone Replacement Therapyto help with her symptoms as it could cause another cancer. To help other women who are experiencing the menopause but canapost receive HRT, Abby is fundraising to buy Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital equipment to provide a new laser treatment that alleviates some of the symptoms of menopause. The treatment is currently only available privately and Abby is trying to raise as much money as she can to make the treatment available on the NHS. So far, she has had support from celebrities like Davina McCall, who sent Abby a personal video in support of her campaign. John Lewis are also hosting a fashion and beauty event in November to help raise money. Abby added: HRT is no good for people like me and thataposs why I want to fundraise for this laser. But the good thing is the awareness is getting out there and theyaposre talking about it now.

The scans show the shocking impact Covid has on peopleaposs internal organs with doctors saying unvaccinated people are the ones getting really sick. Dr Sam Durrani, the chief of staff at Deer Valley Medical Center, said: The only people that are really getting sick are people that are unvaccinated. [They] oftentimes require ventilation and oxygen, especially on some of these really profound X-rays that we are seeing. Vaccinated patients who are infected with Covid have more air flowing to their lungs, with the larger part of the lungs coloured in black on the scans, Dr Durrani explained. This means there is very little or no damage to the lungs. The image of a scan from an unvaccinated person shows that the lungs are very congested, limiting the oxygen flow throughout the entire body. Dr Durrani said: If you have a vaccinated patient that comes to the ER with a breakthrough infection, that maybe have some shortness of breath and we do a CT scan, they’re not nearly as bad as the unvaccinated patients. Even the breakthrough infections that end up getting pneumonia, their CT scans still were not as bad as the ones of unvaccinated patients. Vaccines have been successful in preventing severe illness and death in most people who catch Covid, but it will not work for some. Some double-jabbed people will still end up in hospital with Covid but with a much lower level of congested lungs compared to those without any vaccine protection. Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionshows that risk of dying from Covid is  times higher for unvaccinated adults than those who have been inoculated. In England, just one per cent of all Covid deaths are in those who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccine is working extremely well and is keeping the virus from progressing to pneumonia or infiltrating the lungs, Dr Durrani said. When you get a dose you can get a little sick, but eventually your body recognises it, it attacks it and you don’t get hospitalised, you don’t get put on a ventilator, it’s very profoundly effective.

She used the creams during the transition from warmer to cooler months, as her skin would flare up, but never found her condition unmanageable. But, at , after two pregnancies which appeared to cause more flare ups in her skin, the eczema began appearing in new areas, including her upper lip and arms so she used the cream more frequently. She found that the treatment was becoming less effective, and researched online to find a reason. Then she read about topical steroid withdrawal– severe symptoms experienced by long-term users of steroid creams after they stop use. While other people had documented horric reactions, including red, cracked and itchy skin, Lyndsie didn’t believe she was suffering from it until she decided to quit using the creams in September  to test the theory. “All hell broke loose,” Lyndsie, who is mum to Angel, seven, Justice Jr, five, Aria, three, and Lennox, two, told Jam Press. “The first month after stopping, my face and eyes started swelling so badly. “My rashes started to spread even more, and towards the end of the month my skin was burning and itching so badly that I couldn’t even shower or soak in the tub – my skin couldn’t tolerate water at all. “It felt like acid was being thrown on my skin when I was taking a bath – the itch was intolerable. “By month two, about  per cent of my body was covered in this burning, and non-stop itching rash that continued to worsen. “Between December  and January , my body started to ooze liquid that smelt like old pennies. “I absolutely hated my appearance – I felt like I had lost myself. “During the oozing stage, my oldest daughter would pray at night that I wouldn’t have bad skin anymore so I could hug her without it hurting. “I couldn’t take care of my kids, let alone myself, and so I felt I had lost a part of me.” The oozing even caused the skin around her ears to crust over. It had stopped by February  but she was still fully covered in the “red, itchy and burning” rash. When she visited her dermatologist, Lyndsie claims she was told she would never heal without medical intervention. While Lyndsie was in severe discomfort, she decided to persevere without going back to the steroid creams, believing them to have caused the adverse reaction. Throughout her journey, her husband, Justice, reassured her she was beautul and took over the childcare while she recovered. Lyndsie said: “He made time to believe in me and keep me motivated and in a positive mind frame. He never let me sink into depression nor gave up on me – for that I will forever be grateful for him.” Between March and September , her skin finally started to slowly heal, and by January  the majority of her body had healed. Lyndsie said: “Seeing my skin now makes me feel like a butterfly. I went through hell to be able to transform myself – not just on the outside, but on the inside as well.” Despite all she has been through, Lyndsie doesn’t regret choosing to come off of the creams – not least because her knowledge of TSW has helped her make dferent medical decisions when it comes to her children. She said: “My youngest daughter was diagnosed with eczema following taking an antibiotic for an ear infection which resulted in a rash all over her body, when I was about six months into my journey. “SoI had not went through this I would have used steroid creams on her because that would have been all I knew. Instead I focused on her diet, I used all natural remedies to help her skin heal. “She’s now eczema free – which I also don’t believe she had eczema to begin with, I believe she had an allergic reaction to the medicine. “This journey transformed me to a more positive person all together. I will never take for granted the little things, like just being comfortable with a shirt against my skin.” Her skin is currently totally healed, and the only flare ups she has now are “tiny” and “normally hormonal”. Lyndsie added: “I am now able to live a normal, comfortable le. “Going through topical steroid withdrawal, I felt I was robbed from so many things – but I refuse to look at this experience negatively. “It’s been a blessing in disguise. I was never a huge positive thinker [before], but I’ve been able to stay positive the majority of this time. “The most meaningful thing to me is that my children got to see me overcome this and I hope when they are older it will be an example of inner strength. “Overcoming this has made me feel invincible, like I can take on anything the universe throws my way.” Comment MORE ON SteroidsMedicineEczema\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

My son told a staff member of the cafe there had been an incident and to bring a first aid kit.Eventually, the man felt able to sit up and he was helped to a table at the cafe by some lovely people. A member of staff brought the First aid kit and we cleaned up his face and temporary patch.The man was with a walking group and I found  of them who began to walk to get his car to get the man home.The staff member askedhe wanted anything. He wanted waterand as heaposd have to wait for whilst his lt arrived he wanted a cuppa tea with several sugars.I went into the cafe and put in his request, took them to him. His friend appeared mins later with the car eventually and off they went.I ed to my children and dog and then went to order drinks and cake for us. As I paying the member of staff was running through my order said oh yes, and a cup of tea. Me: I hadnapost ordered a tea. Staff: aposItaposs the tea you bought earlier.apos Me:aposBut that was the man who had the accident....aposStaff aposIs he coming to pay for it  Me: aposNo heaposs leftapos.

Iaposm a scaredy-cat afraid of a challenge, arenapost I  I shouldnapost have paid.People were left ided, as some argued that the cafe shouldnapost be left out of pocket. One fumed: How much does a teabag and cup of hot water cost, what a bunch of meanies. Hope he is ok. Another wrote: I can’t believe they expected anyone to pay for a cup of tea! How much does a cup of tea cost them to make  Certainly not what they charge for it. They could have covered it themselves for the man who fell. But a third added: Well, you should have offered to pay for it, to begin with. It wouldn’t have even crossed my mind not to offer.

It’s not always dressing up in silly costumes though, there’s often a lot of mystery surrounding the world of witchcraft because of its intriguing history. We often forget about the dark narrative behind witches, particularly during the Salem witch trials. What exactly were the Salem witch trials  This was the story of one townaposs journey from paranoia to obsession, which continues to be a talking point more than  years later.Discussed in a recent YouTube video uploaded by TedEd, the witches were almost always accused of a crime they quite clearly did not commit.If the witch insisted on their innocence, they were likely to be found guilty and executed, butthey confessed and apologised, they would go free. Although this sounds reasonably simple, it really wasn’t, with the risk of a public hanging loomingthey didn’t ly confess. Between  and , the village of Salem, Massachusetts, were the aposvictims of paranoia about the supernaturalapos explained narrator Susan Zimmerman. Settled in  by Puritans, a group of English protestants, the people of Salem feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers were strained.  That winter, the coldest winter on record, two cousins -year-old Betty Parris and -year-old Bethany Williams started acting strangely. A physician found nothing physically wrong, but diagnosed the girls as being ‘under an evil hand’. As the news swept through the village of Salem, symptoms appeared to spread, with  so-called ‘afflicted’ girls contorting their body. They had fits, and complained of a prickling sensation on the skin, and later accused three local women of tormenting them. The authorities soon arrested Sarah Good, Sarah Osbourne and a woman only known as ‘Tituba’. Tibuta later confessed and accused Good and Osbourne of forcing her into witchcraft, yet they still insisted they were innocent. Osbourne later died in prison, and Good’s own husband and daughter later turned against her in court.  Good later gave birth in prison, where she was convicted and eventually hanged. Zimmerman continued: “These three women were just the beginning, with many other women making  confessions to save themselves.” “They were not interested in investigating the charges, in keeping with their churches teachings, they preferred that the accused confessed and asked for forgiveness.” To complicate matters further, many of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers, compromising objectivity. By the spring of , over a hundred people had been imprisoned and  women and six men were executed. Zimmerman concluded: “When the governoraposs own we was accused, the governor of Massachusetts suspended the trials. “Sentences were amended and prisoners were released, with some suspecting the hallucinations were caused by fungus. “The Salem witch trials remain a cautionary tale of the dangers of groupthink and scapegoating, and the power of fear to manipulate human perception.” Today, the city of Salem is a popular choice for tourists who want to find out more about the mysterious world of witchcraft.

The woman, in her thirties, married her husband Buford around a year ago, and together they became a family, alongside her two children from a previous marriage - eight-year-old Jay and Juniper, five. Both the woman and her husband had been of the belief that Buford had no children, and they had no intentions of having anymore - until they recently discovered the man does in fact have a -year-old daughter called Markita, who he was never told of. Her mom did not tell Buford about her pregnancy and ultimately moved states, so he had no idea until she reached out on Facebook. We were a little dubious, but she turned out to be right, the woman explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum. Markita and mom moved back to our state in the meantime and live about  minutes from us. She wants visitation with Buford which he has agreed to. Thereaposs no formal custody arrangement between Buford and mom so itaposs basically just sporadic weekends and school holidays. Usually this is just between the two of them, but sometimes she will come to the house and has even slept over a few times.  However, the issue lies around the fact that Markita almost exclusively communicates via sign language, which no one in the family knows, although Buford is making serious effort to learn in order to communicate with his long lost child. The last time Markita was here he pitched to me the idea of us learning sign language as a family. The truth is that I really donapost knowthat is worth the effort. Markita is present at our house maybe once a month. I would consider itshe were going to be over more often, but I work  hours a week and I just donapost have time for something like this, she continued. I also know three dferent languages, one of which was in adulthood and it was very dficult for me even fteen years ago. I just canapost fit something like that into my le, but I told Buford that Jay and Juniper can still learntheyaposre interested. The kids donapost want to since Iaposm not and now Buford thinks Iaposm being ridiculous since I have no other way of communicating with Markita. She added: I told him we can work something out but he didnapost want to hear it honestly. Markita also thinks I should learn some basic signs but between work and kids even that would be a struggle. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was in the wrong for not wanting to learn sign language, and the vast majority of people seemed to think she was.  Try to imagine that one of your biological kids were hearing impaired and they exclusively used sign language. Now imagine that their stepmother or even another family member refused to learn even the basics in order to effectively communicate. Now imagine that family member’s own children refused to learn the basics because their parent refuses. How would you feel  one Reddit user vented. Even better, imagine how you’d feelyour husband decided to dismiss your children in favour of his daughter  You’re degrading his child and dismissing her needs because of things that are out of her control! That is so heartless! You expect your husband to treat your children like family but you refuse to treat his child like family. Another added: Wow! aposI don’t knowit’s worth it,apos seriously  My new step-daughter, that I didn’t want has a disability but I unwilling to make any effort to accommodate and as such I have taught my kids that they don’t have to make any effort either. Not only are you an a**hole but you’re the definition of a wicked step-mother and terrible role model to your own children. Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter hereShe explained: So, my ex gives me a generous amount of child support every month and I use about -% of it maybe. I’m very good at budgeting since my mum raised me on her own and we always stuck to a strict budget. My ex grew up being overindulged and knowing he would never have to worry about money in his letime, so we have dferent ideas of what living cheaply looks like. Recently, the topic of money became an issue between them - after her ex discovered she was walking their four-year-old to school every day. He initially offered to buy her a car, before demanding she takes him to school in a taxi after she refused to purchase one. She said: Again, I told him no and he brought up all of the other ways he thought I was making our son aposlive cheaplyapos. He said I didn’t buy him new football boots when he started getting into football , I buy him “cheap” clothes, I rarely take him to eat out andwe go to a toy shop, I only ever let him get one thing and it can’t be super expensive. When he asked where the money was going, the woman told him sheaposs saved it, either for a rainy day or for our son. Now he’s angry at me for making our son “live cheaply” and essentially told me to stop saving and actually give our son the things he wants now because he had already made sure our son would be fine in the future, she added. People were split, with many thinking the mum should save the money on behalf of their son - not for anything . One wrote: All that money should be used to support your son not “put away for a rainy day” put any access money in a college fund or something for his future. This is not your money, it’s for your son.Another added: Setting the money aside in case her son needs something in the future is smart. She’s not acquiring it for herself. The dad is wealthy now but things can change. Paying for an Uber home from school isn’t normal. Her son’s needs are being met and wanting to make sure that continues regardless ofher ex’s financial situation or willingness to pay changes is not acting in bad faith. Home-cooked meals instead of eating out and only buying one toy at a time doesn’t sound like they are living in squalor, wrote a third.

We have no cooking facilities so are living on cheese, bread and biscuits.” He said he and his we are forced to send the children out to buy food or risk being killed on sight.  He added: “We are utterly desperate now. Only a handful of people have been offered flights from the Government, but it is not offering to airlt our families. “I look into the eyes of my children, who ask every day when the Prime Minister will save them.” He regularly flew to Afghanistan for business and met his we there.

I pulled and didnapost want to let go. I tried for five seconds, with unbearable pain and it wouldnapost come unstuck. I got out of bed, turned on the light, saw my cut mouth and the giant centipede on the deck. Although centipede venom can typically cause swelling and some pain it isnapost usually dangerous to humans, but Natalie was concerned because of the location of the bite around her mouth. As she was also suffering from shortness of breath, she decided to get medical attention after the bite on  October.

measuring around five metres by one and a half # represents something signicant enough that today it was pulled from the mud for six months of conservation work ahead of a museum exhibition.The effort this morning was the culmination of much hard work by a team at the Garioch Heritage Centre, led by project coordinator Joan Bruce.She was first alerted to the history behind the boat by fellow member Marc Falconer, who had spotted a Facebook post about it.The story centres on a canal that linked Aberdeen and Inverurie in the first half of the th Century, running through the heart of an area rich with industry.Though it lasted barely  years before being replaced by the railway, the waterway played an enormous role in expanding paper-making, granite quarrying and agriculture in central Aberdeenshire.The cast iron barge that was sticking out from the undergrowth at Kirkwood Commercial Park is believed to be the last existing boat that worked on the canal, and can be dated back at least  years.Mrs Bruce said: #I want to use the boat as a starting point for telling the story of transport, through showing the canal boat in its cleaned-up form, possibly giving it the context of a picture of the canal basin.#Because it was such an important part of enabling the agricultural industry, the granite industry and the paper industry to start developing much more, and then of course the canal route was used directly for the railway itself.#Ultimately, the barge will become the centre of an exhibition on the upper floor of the heritage centre, located in Inverurie.However, before it gets there, it had to be removed from the ground where it had been sitting since being dredged from the canal bed more than  years ago.This was the operation that took place earlier today, involving a crane and several members of the local Garioch Rugby Club.Mrs Bruce said: #There were people going down over the last couple of days assessing how they might lt it.#When I spoke toand said he needs to tell us what to do, he said, #What you need’s a rugby team of strong guys who are used to working as a team.##He was half-joking, and I said, #Are you serious # and he said, #I am actually, that would work.#She called in former Heritage Centre committee member and rugby club honorary president Jim Black to lend a hand.Mr Black said: #We thought that the rugby club might like to get involved and provide a few bodies to try and help lt it.#The guys have said there will be a number there.#A productive morning spent helping Garioch Heritage recover an old inspection barge from Port Elphinstone for restoration.Well done guys, much appreciated.Posted by Garioch Rugby onSaturday,  October He added: #The important thing is that we try and keep the boat intact so we can get it up to our museum in a good condition. It’s amazingly well preserved.#In the end, it was the crane that did most of the hard work, and the boat is now being transported to a premises provided by local businesswoman Heather Watt where it will be conserved, assessed and stabilised by experts.Mrs Bruce said: #We#re hoping in the spring that we can have that ready to have some sort of a launch of the initial stage of this rethink of the upstairs gallery featuring the barge.#She thanked Kirkwood Commercial Park for their support and assistance in getting the rare artefact out of the ground there.The park#s site manager Graeme Sutherland said: #We are delighted to support Garioch Heritage Centre by donating this unique artefact.#It means we have been able to play a part in conserving the history of the Garioch for future generations to enjoy.#By telling the story of transport, we can get a better understanding of how its development affected the le and work of the people of the area.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.58395015-7odxyqwg-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.58395015-7odxyqwg-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.58395015-7odxyqwg-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.58395015-7odxyqwg-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"this is why raf jet was heard over aberdeen today","story":"A RAF Lossiemouth Typhoon jet has had to make an unexpected landing in Aberdeen.

win against Hibernian.The Dons lost Jack Mackenzie to injury before the game and both Calvin Ramsay and Declan Gallagher were forced off with injuries in the first half of the game at Pittodrie.The loss of the players meant the Dons had to revert to a back three for the second half with team captain Scott Brown deployed as sweeper in the victory.Glass said: “We had to reshape things and boys weren’t playing in natural positions.“In the second half we didn’t have as much possession as we would have liked so we changed the shape a little bit to get more pressure on them.“There were crosses and shots from distance but we didn’t give up a lot of opportunities for them to score.“If we had made the mistakes we had previously, maybe I would be sitting here saying the same things.”With Mackenzie set to see a specialist on Monday to assess the extent of his ankle injury suffered in training on Thursday the Aberdeen manager is fearing the worst.Glass also believes it is unlikely Ramsay and Gallagher will be available for Wednesday’s trip to Ibrox to face Premiership champions Rangers.He said: “I don’t know but I would guess Wednesday would be too quick as two fo them came off.“But I hope that I am wrong.“Jack Mackenzie will be assessed on Monday but it looked like a bad one on Thursday at training.“Sometimes when you are under the cosh things get thrown at you and you have to deal with it.“The players showed they are a group that can play multiple positions which helps.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll teachers to speak at local climate summit","story":" Updated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council will host its first education climate summit next week with local teachers playing a pivotal role in the event.On October  and  speakers from schools, businesses and charities will address the online event to raise awareness of a broad range of climate issues.Taynuilt teacher Jenner Love will tell those attending about how her pupils have been working with a local textile company to create natural, powerful messages to raise awareness of climate change.Taynuilt Primary School pupils worked with textile company Crubag as part of a project documenting research they had carried out into plastics on their shorelines. The children created mood boards of their findings and created designs using printing techniques taught to them by Crubag.The designs were inspired by the results of their shore investigations, using microscope images of the plastics and materials they had found on the beach. The result was artwork with a powerful message. The designs were printed onto organic cotton and used to cover recycled paper notebooks.Also speaking at the summit will be Rhu Primary School head teacher Linda MacBeath who will talk about the Queen’s Green Canopy project, a tree planting initiative the school has been taking part in.Each session will last approximately one hour and will include presentations by the Scottish Association for Marine Science, ALIEnergy, Wreckspeditions Dive Charters Ltd, Time for Change Argyll and the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust.The council’s policy lead for education Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: #Argyll and Bute Council has signed up to meet Scotland’s target of achieving ‘net zero’ by . We have one of the lowest carbon footprints anywhere in the UK and I firmly believe thatwe all make some changes, even small ones, we could become the first local authority to achieve ‘net zero’ per head of population.#Education is at the heart of thiswe are to succeed and our schools are already doing amazing things to help raise awareness of global issues in our fight against climate change. This summit will be a great opportunity for our communities to come together and showcase what they are doing to make a dference.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

If they cannot, we are confident that the service will run in , but we will not be able to offer a service next year,# said Mr Abernethy.He added that both state-owned ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, which had been barred from running the route by the government, and Sea Containers had looked at the route and were convinced it was profitable.The enterprise company has been standing by ready to invest more than £ million in the Campbeltown Harbour redevelopment, with a further £. million attracted through the European Objective One programme.The project, seen as one of the most important for the whole of Argyll for decades, will involve the construction of a terminal, a roll-on roll-off linkspan and berthing facilities, access roads and car parking.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe town clerk received a letter from the Ministry of Defence asking the councilthe refuse dump at the Aros Moss could be closed down as soon as possible, because of the danger to aircraft from the large number of gulls.After discussion it was agreed to ask the Ministry of Defenceit would be willing to contribute something towards the cost of a machine for disposing of the refuse.Treasurer Hulbert suggested that the gulls be killed and, after the town clerk reminded him that some species of gulls were protected by law, Mr Hulbert said: #Black-backed gulls are regarded as winged vermin and therefore can be shot.#He added: #This would be a lot cheaper.#[Editor#s note: This was lawful  years ago it is not today. In the words of the RSPB: #All species of gull are protected under the Wildle and Countryside Act  and the WildleOrder . This makes it illegal to intentionally or, in Scotland and Northern Ireland, recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is also illegal to prevent birds from accessing their nests and, in Northern Ireland, it is illegal to disturb any nesting bird. In addition, the Mediterranean gull is protected under Schedule  of both acts. This makes it illegal to intentionally or recklessly disturb the birds at or close to their nest or to disturb their dependent young. However, the law recognises that in certain circumstances control measures may be necessary. Simple nuisance or minor damage to property are not legally sanctioned reasons to kill gulls.#]ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Glasgow News says that there is now confirmation of the statement made recently that among the constituencies to be contested by the Independent Liberals at the next election is Argyll.This stronghold of Sir William Sutherland is to be attacked by that soldier-journalist-author, Captain R W Campbell, whose Spud Tamson, a wartime sketch, gained him some notoriety five years ago.

The superb fluttering of light was of startling beauty and dazzling splendour, momentarily illuminating the sky from horizon to horizon.Accompanied by this brilliant display of lightscape were sharp cracks and outbursts of thunder, which rumbled, reverberated and re-echoed throughout the landscape with an eerie sort of foreboding effect.The phenomenon was characterised by a high percentage of fork lightning, which is most unusual in our temperate zone."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 15","story":"It was encouraging to see a positive and constructive debate, with cross-party MSPs from across the region delivering a similar message.What matters now is what happens next.John Gurr, chairman of the Rest and Be Thankful Campaign group, has invited Transport Minister Graeme Dey and the area#s MSPs to join him in a journey along the route, #on the bus too,#desired.Whatever mode of transport Mr Dey choses to take one thing remains certain.

It was secured by what became the second of the famous Kintyre passenger transport company names, A  P McConnachie.Further new operators joined the fray and, as was common in those days, intense competition occurred everywhere in the country until regulatory route licensing was introduced in  with the arrival of the Road Traffic Act.Post Office mails and parcels contracts formed a key part of the Kintyre service network in a similar but much further reaching geographical spread, the now famous MacBraynes organisation of those times similarly carried parcels and mails to destinations across the western seaboard and western isles in its own fleet of buses and motor ships.In the mid-s,West Coast Motors obtained a contract to convey mails and parcels to and from Campbeltown and Glasgow.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio.

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his

That should remain.ldquoIt would be negative to split it up ndash it is not what people would want.The proposals were revealed last Thursday, marking the start of an eight-week consultation.For Scotland as a whole, the number of MPs would be cut from  to . Meanwhile, there would  additional MPs in England, eight fewer in Wales and no change in Northern Ireland.Lord Matthews, Deputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Scotland, said: ldquoI believe this is a promising start to delivering the requirements of the new rules that mean the number of constituencies in Scotland will reduce from  to , and that each mainland constituency must have broadly the same number of electors.ldquoWe have set out proposals which do that and are, we believe, a good implementation of the rules set by Parliament.ldquoThis is the beginning of a process and we now want to hear the views of the public.ldquoWe will reflect on responses to the consultation and make changes where appropriate and where the legislation allows us to do so.ldquoWe strongly encourage voters to make their views heard.At the last General Election in East Lothian, Kenny MacAskill won the seat for the SNP by a majority of , over incumbent Labour MP Martin Whitfield ndash Mr MacAskill has since left the SNP and joined the ALBA Party.The proposed changes would have no effect to the existing Scottish Parliament constituencies, which see Musselburgh, Wallyford and Whitecraig included as part of the Midlothian North and Musselburgh constituency, and the rest of the county in the East Lothian constituency.ConstraintsEast Lothian MP Mr MacAskill said of the proposals: ldquoBoundaries are rightly not set by politicians or their parties.ldquoThere are constraints given the population set for a constituency and the fact that East Lothian is larger.ldquoTherersquos no easy way of cutting and preferably that wouldnrsquot happen. Butitrsquos to proceed, this may be viewed as one of the least worst options.Paul McLennan, MSP for East Lothian, highlighted the connection between East Lothian and the Honest Toun.He said: ldquoI would encourage constituents who have concerns to engage with the consultation.ldquoThe proposed boundary changes will have no effect on the Scottish Parliamentary constituency however, there have always been close links between Musselburgh and the rest of East Lothian, especially at a local government level.ldquoWhatever the outcome, I will continue to work closely with neighbouring politicians on matters that affect us all like transport and local infrastructure.Martin Whitfield, South Scotland MSP, was not a fan of iding Musselburgh.He said: ldquoI appreciate that the Boundary Commission has a dficult task, especially considering East Lothianrsquos rapidly growing population, but iding Musselburgh in two simply makes no sense.ldquoThe proposal would split the East Lothian Council boundary, as well as the ward boundary, breaking local community ties and creating confusion for residents.ldquoI hope that the commission will listen carefully to the views expressed on these initial proposals and reconsider how the boundaries here will be configured.Craig Hoy, fellow South Scotland MSP, queried the renaming of East Lothian to East Lothian Coast.He said: ldquoI am relieved to see that the Boundary Commission are looking at keeping most of East Lothian within the same parliamentary seat.ldquoThis is an ongoing consultation, so over the coming weeks I will be engaging with constituents in East Lothian to get their views on this review.ldquoMusselburgh is not part of the area I represent and so I cannot comment on parliamentary boundaries in that area.ldquoRegarding

Silver inlaid with  of gold, decorated with little knuckles of amber and red glass, it is a thing of beauty.ldquoThis is the best example of its kind anywhere in Britain or Ireland, Maldonado says. ldquoIt would have been worn by someone of the top level. Wersquore talking kings or bishops.He points to the intricate carvings in the gold. ldquoThe closer you look the more you see. The little birdies there, the little animals. The best one is the wolf, he says, pointing to a tiny snout.Ornate patterns of animal figures curl around and across the gold. Dating to around AD, this is an example of the height of craft and art in the eighth century.So, the question is how did it end up buried in a Viking womanrsquos grave more than  years later at the end of the ninth century Adrian Maldonado examines a Viking axe headToday, Maldonado, until recently Glenmorangie Research Fellow and now the Galloway Hoard researcher, is laying out the answer. And in doing so hersquos telling us a story of the Vikings that may be a little dferent than the one we think we know.ldquoThis is buried at the end of the ninth century, he says of the brooch-pin, which was discovered by an Orkney farmer in . ldquoOne of the first generation of Viking burials in Westness.ldquoThis is a woman who is about  to  when she dies. She seems to die in childbirth because there is an infant in the grave with her. Shersquos wearing her oval brooches, Scandinavian-style, and this, one of the best examples anywhere of a brooch-pin of this kind.ldquoThe interesting thing about Westness is that itrsquos a Viking cemetery, but itrsquos in a Pictish burial ground. The Picts are already burying there. The Vikings, instead of setting up a new burial ground, just bury alongside the Picts.ldquoThe Westness woman, in particular, has this real mix of Norse stuff, Irish stuff, English stuff and this thing, he says, pointing to the brooch-pin, ldquoprominently displayed. So, shersquos wearing little belts that are probably Northumbrian, shersquos got a comb that is probably Friesian, shersquos got a beaded necklace from Germany.ldquoSo, this person is showing off all the dferent things the Viking world has access to in one burial.ldquoAnd the fact that she is wearing this means shersquos probably of Irish or Pictish descent.Three other women buried as Vikings on the site have had their bones tested and have been declared ldquoinsular, which means theyrsquore from Ireland, Scotland or northern England.ldquoTheyrsquore definitely not Norse women, Maldonado explains. ldquoAnd the men from that same cemetery tend to be from colder climates and so they are Norse.Viking brooches held in storage at the National Museums Collection CentreWhat does this all mean  It means that some of our cliched notions of the Vikings may be wrong. That the idea of the Vikings as wild warriors looting and burning and pillaging their way across Europe for a couple of centuries from the end of the eighth century is not the whole story.The true Viking saga is a more complex, fluid one than we sometimes allow. And itrsquos one that takes in Ireland, England, the Arab world and the birth of Scotland.Or, put another way, itrsquos another chapter of the human story itself a story of encounters that sometimes led to violence but also to trade, to wealth, to marriage, to the sharing of ideas and ultimately to integration or assimilation.Maldonado is a modern-day example of that story himself. Born in Puerto Rico, the -year-old studied medieval history at Hard. In his third year he came to St Andrews on an exchange programme. ldquoAnd I saw the Border abbeys, I saw St Andrews Cathedral. That was it. Medieval history was over, and I transitioned into archaeology. I came back to Glasgow for a Masters.In  he was appointed the Glenmorangie Research Fellow, a position funded by the whisky distiller, which has meant rummaging around in the storerooms of the National Museums Collection Centre in Granton where we are today.There are roughly , items on display in the National Museum of Scotland up in Chambers Street. In Granton, there are some  million more, spread around  buildings. This installation is more than just storage, though. Itrsquos a centre for conservation, preservation and scientic research.And so, Maldonado has been working his way through tray after tray of Viking artefacts since . Out of this has come a new book, Crucible of Nations, and a renewed idea of who the Vikings were and how they changed European history. And Scottish history into the bargain.Read More: What did the Romans do for us Itrsquos a story that begins at the end of the eighth century with the first Viking raid on the British Isles. A violent insertion into the story that has echoed down the centuries.Their target was monasteries. ldquoTheyrsquore like the universities of their day with all the money and wealth and resources that brings, Maldonado explainsldquoThe bishops are wearing gold rings, theyrsquore wearing silk and fine robes, and these places are quite open. At the end of the eighth century word gets to Scandinavia.In AD, the first Viking raid hits Lindisfarne in Northumbria. Two years later, Iona is targeted.The Vikings seize wealth, and they seize people. Some to sell off as slaves. Some to hold for ransom.ldquoFrom there itrsquos a couple of years of smash and grab raids, incredible violence, Maldonado continues. ldquoOn Iona,  people are killed during a raid in .ldquoItrsquos a massacre. Instead of taking people away something went wrong.ldquoBut that seems to be the exception.And this is key. For all our populist notions of Viking raids there is little actual evidence of burning churches and mass executions.ldquoIt almost never happens, Maldonado points out. ldquoThere is only one place in Scotland that has good evidence of violence and burning down.Adrian Maldonado in the NMS Collection CentreldquoPortmahomack [in Easter Ross] was the sight of a massive monastery that was completely undocumented. But an archaeological excavation has uncovered a huge burning layer.ldquoThere are a couple of skulls with blade wounds to the head. Thatrsquos the one place where it definitely seems to have taken place. Otherwise, it just doesnrsquot happen.The reality of the Viking age is more nuanced. As time passes, the Vikings begin to settle in the north and west of Scotland and along the coast of Ireland. They become part of our island story.ldquoDublin is the big one. But in Scotland they take over entire islands. Colonsay seems to go completely Viking. Thatrsquos Viking headquarters. There are loads of burials, loads of settlement evidence.ldquoSome islands like Mull seem to have no Viking settlements or Viking burials. You could read that in a couple of dferent ways. The people of Mull fought them back hellip Maybe. Or they came to an agreement.ldquoThatrsquos something that we donrsquot really talk about with the Vikings. We imagine them killing their way through. But the patterns of settlement really show you something .Thatrsquos not to say they didnrsquot fight. In The Wolf Age, his new history of the Vikings in the th century, the Norwegian historian Tore Skeie argues that to the Vikings war ldquowas a kind of natural state, a completely commonplace part of the world and peoplersquos lives.And therersquos no question they fought on Scottish soil. At the beginning of the Viking age in the ninth century there was a huge battle in AD which saw the death of both the Pictish King and the King of Dalriada at Viking hands.There would be more battles in the ninth century, but the Vikings quickly established settlements on Orkney, Shetland, the Hebrides and possibly in Strathclyde. And by the late ninth century the ision between Viking and native is beginning to rub away at the edges.What we begin to see is the Vikings settle beside the Picts and the Irish. They bring their families with them as part of the war bands, set up homes in Ireland and what would become Scotland. And they begin to intermarry. Hence the woman in the grave in Westness wearing a brooch-pin made  years and maybe more before she lived and died.A new term is invented for these Vikings who have settled in the British Isles, ldquoforeigner Gaels.The result is a flow of information and influence flowing both ways, with the waters of the North Sea and the Irish Sea as the information highways.ldquoThe Vikings bring this Irish fashion out of Ireland into Scotland. And then it goes back to Norway, and they start making their own Norse-flavour brooches and pins in that Irish style, Maldonado explains.ldquoThe colonial process goes both ways. It seems that people are moving in both directions and families are coming over here, bringing the objects that they wore in Scandinavia, and we end up seeing them in their graves.ldquoBut more often than not theyrsquore wearing Scandinavian brooches with stuff made in Dublin, stuff made here.Silver is the wealth of the time. The Vikings access Russia via the Baltic and then travel down the silk road, selling slaves in exchange for silver.ldquoTheyrsquore bringing back pure silver from the Islamic world. We know that because we have these dirham coins, Arabic coins, that are minted in Uzbekistan and found in Viking hoards in Scotland, Maldonado explains.And that wealth begins to be spread around. ldquoIf you see which way the wind is blowing, you might learn a bit of Norse to trade at least. If you donrsquot go fully Viking, you at least pick up a few words. If you give them the cattle they want, you might get a bit of silver out of it.ldquoThatrsquos the Galloway hoard in a nutshell.The hoard, which dates to AD is the richest collection of Viking-age objects found in Britain and Ireland. It was discovered at Balmaghie in Kirkcudbrightshire in .What was found may look Viking, but there are Anglo-Saxon names written on it, Maldonado points out.ldquoSo, these are locals. It just shows you that people can plug into this system once itrsquos in place.What emerges then is a picture of peoples living alongside each other in settlements, sharing craft skills and culture. Gaels beside Vikings in Ireland, Picts beside Vikings on the Scottish islands. And as time passes there is inevitably a blurring of those lines.Ideas and influences are shared, whether that be jewellery designs or Gods. By the th and th centuries Vikings were beginning to convert to Christianity or at least paying lip service to the new God in exchange for the possibility of more trade or influence.But in this push and pull of cultural influences there were inevitably losers. And in this case, it seems to have the Picts.Orkney and Shetland were Pictish once. The evidence of Pictish symbols carved in stone suggests as much. And yet there are no Pictish place names left, though some ndash Pitlochry, Aberfeldy ndash still exist on the mainland.Does that suggest the Vikings simply wiped the Picts out on the islands  ldquoItrsquos not so easy as that, Maldonado points out. ldquoThe archaeology doesnrsquot show any evidence of that wiping out. What you have is Viking objects in Pictish houses for about  years.ldquoItrsquos like they are living alongside each other, or the Vikings are taking their homes. Either way, there is not this overnight massacre. You just donrsquot see it. Theyrsquore using Pictish combs alongside Norse combs, old brooches, new brooches side by side.ldquoFor at least  years there is this overlap and then it goes a little bit more strongly Norse. And the idea is they didnrsquot have to wipe anybody out. After a while in Orkney and Shetland theyrsquore trading with Norway more than they are trading with anybody . People are right on the motorway there.ldquoIt just becomes easier to pick up Norse and have Norse be the language of business, the language of the kings. And eventually it just becomes the language that everybody speaks.The Picts were squeezed between the Viking incursions and the increasing strength and influence of the Gaels.Eventually, therersquos no more Pictish language, there are no more Pictish symbols. On the islands they speak Norse, where they start speaking Gaelic.ldquoAnd thatrsquos the beginning of Alba, suggests Maldonado. ldquoSo, the Picts disappear in the Viking age. Theyrsquore the only people that this happens to. Everybody  kind of makes their way through.And Picts apart, this, Maldonado points out, is the real story of the Viking age. Itrsquos a story of dferent peoples rubbing against each other, sometimes, often, violently, but also becoming intertwined.And that can be seen in the Viking artefacts in front of us in Granton here today.ldquoTheir shields are made in Dublin their swords are made in France and the pins are made in Ireland. And we call these things Viking, Maldonado concludes.This is the complex and interrelated truth about the Vikings. Their story is our story tooOn the tray in front of us the Westness brooch glitters still, more than , years after it was made, a shining beacon from the Dark Ages, a time more complex than we sometimes imagine.Crucible of Nations: Scotland from Viking Age to Medieval Kingdom by Adrian Maldonado, published by National Museums Scotland Enterprises, is available to pre-order now.

These can be chopped up as well. If yoursquore making a small transaction, you can cut a bit off.Gold arm ring, Oxna, Shetland, th centuryldquoThe gold rings are almost never chopped up.

Butyou look really closely you can see wolf heads. Tiny eyes, tiny ears and this is the snout going up here.ldquoThe Vikings bury weapons with the dead as part of the funerary rituals.

Infection levels, which fell sharply through September, stalled suddenly around October  and have plateaued ever since with some areas - Falkirk, East Dunbartonshire, Fe and Clackmannanshire - now seeing fairly rapid increases again.In the month after moving to Beyond Zero on August , Scotland also saw the fastest rise in infections of any part of the UK. This coincided of course with an end to social distancing and the reopening of nightclubs, with revellers allowed to hit the dancefloors mask-free.: The surprising fall in Scotlands Covid cases - but will it last Yet Englands July  Freedom Day - which also included nightclub reopening, an end to distancing and the scrapping of facemasks - saw no such spike.What about theof schools  Between the first pupils ing in Scotland on August  and September , when infections peaked, average daily cases surged by nearly %.In England, the first three weeks after schools ed saw a % drop in cases.Wales currently has the highest Covid rates per head in the UK, whereas Scotland - which was highest during much of August and September - has seen case rates fallIn both countries, school-age children accounted for a disproportionate majority of infections even though Scotland has the UKs strictest policy on mask wearing for pupils and England does not enforce them at all.Even the recent testing blunder which saw some , people in the south of England wrongly given  negatives after September  does not sht the overall picture signicantly.England has only really seen a consistent rise in infections since the beginning of October - the same point where Scotlands decline in cases stopped and levelled off. The same is true for Wales and Northern Ireland, whose cases have also been climbing since the beginning of this month.None of this is to say that mitigations including facemasks, homeworking, and vaccine passports dont work.Rather it tells us that unpicking the impact of ious measures in a real-world setting with so many confounding iables, especially around human behaviour, is extremely dficult.The reality is that we dont really know why Englands epidemic played out so unexpectedly, nor can we know how much worse Scotlands third wave might have been without them.Scotland has now vaccinated half of -s, compared to around % in England. But over % of -s and % of -s remain unvaccinated. Most other nations are also double vaccinating children over Vaccine passports, of course, have only just come into force. Comparing approaches and outcomes in Scotland and Wales against England and Northern Ireland, and parts of Europe - where they apply to most public spaces - would be illuminating.It is not a straight comparison though: much of the continent also benefits from lower levels of obesity, higher healthcare spending, and less chronic multi-morbidity, which has also helped to keep their Covid death rates lower relative to the UK.For now then, Boris Johnson is banking on vaccines and boostersto get England through.In Scotland, nearly, people have had their Covid booster - enough to cover all care home residents, and around % of all frontline NHS, social care workers and over-s combined.The - age group have begun receiving appointment letters.Nonetheless, organisations including Age Scotland, have expressed concern that the programme is not moving fast enough at a time when over-s - a group which is entirely fully-vaccinated - are making up % of hospital Covid admissions, up from % in mid-September.Over , have now had boosters and .% of people aged -plus are fully vaccinated. However, protection against infection appears to wane around six monthsThe JCVI is now said to be considering moving boosters to five months, rather than six months, amid concerns about waning immunity, winter pressures on the NHS, and new evidence that they propel protection against symptomatic infection back up to %.If so, --year-olds who mostly received their second doses from mid-May would suddenly become eligible now, as opposed to mid-November.Meanwhile, nearly one in  eligible Scots - , people aged  and over - are yet to be vaccinated at all.Anything that can be done to enable or persuade this group to come forward still remains our best remaining weapon against Covid this winter."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13129287.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-high-street-plan-criticised-business-owner","story":"However, those heading up a project to revitalise the citys oldest, medieval street say tourists could be forgiven for thinking they have arrived \"at the edge of the world\".The area is home to some of the citys most important heritage buildings including the Toll Booth, which was built in  and housed the town hall, court and jail.However, business owners say shop closures - in recent years - neglected buildings and crime have turned High Street into a no-go zone.Now, a team of architects, who have informed regeneration projects in London, are hoping to change that by assisting council planners in an action plan to revitalise the historic area.High Street Heritage is being led by New Practice, is led by Marc Cairns and Becca Thomas, who have previously sat on the Mayor of Londons urban design .They are hoping the brand name for the project, Mon the High Street will appeal to Glaswegians and their propensity to champion the underdog.However, not all business owners were enthusiastic about the project.

Close to the SEC campus, where it is being held, a ring of steel has already been thrown up as preparations are scaled up.However, while there are warnings that its citizens may face disruption during the -day event through travel restrictions, strikes by rail and cleansing workers and potential demonstration issues, itrsquos first citizen, Lord Provost Philip Braat, believes this is a time when the city is on the cusp of being part of history.Read more: Glasgow art schools Mackintosh building to be faithfully reinstated after devastating fireldquoIt is exciting that the eyes of the world will be on Glasgow and itrsquos that Glasgow is probably the most talked-about city on the planet right now ndash and quite rightly so, the Lord Provost said.ldquoIt is great that Glasgow has been chosen as the host city for this historic event. Over the last few decades, Glasgow has built up this reputation as a centre for excellence and, with its expertise and knowhow, for being able to host some of the biggest exhibitions and conferences and sporting events. We just have to think back to the Commonwealth Games in  and to the Euros, more recently, so I think that hosting COP is a worthy reflection of that reputation. I am also very happy that it is here because, ultimately, after the past  months that we as city and society have gone through.Mr Braat believes there will be benefits to businesses and citizens at a much-needed time.He added: ldquoThere will be thousands of delegates and activists coming to the city and it will be a massive boon to the cityrsquos economy and in particular to the hospitality trade at a time when they need that injection of support. I think COP will deliver that.ldquoEven more importantly I think we have to realise that the summit and its outcome will benefit the world and it is of an existential importance to everyone, not just to this city, but to the whole planet. The result is absolutely critical so I am hoping that on November  to be reading headlines that we have the Glasgow Agreement. That is ultimately what we are aiming for ndash a in that positive, meaningful end result after two weeks of negotiations that will hopefully give us a signicant legacy and a signicant sustainable planet to take forward so that the next generations wonrsquot look back with shame on the current generation.As steps are made to get the city COP ready, the cityrsquos leadership has faced criticism in past weeks over its cleansing policy and claims of dirty streets and there was a backlash when Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken dismissed them, saying the city needed no more than a ldquospruce up ahead of COP.Read more: Clarkston falls silent in tribute to gas disaster victims  years onSpeaking yesterday, Ms Aitken said the council was focusing on dealing with fly-tipping ahead of the COP summit and acknowledged there are ldquohotspots where it is a particular problem.Ms Aitken said the pandemic has had a ldquosignicant impact on the cityrsquos cleansing services but she insisted the litter situation is improving.With road closures due to be in place, including part of the Clydeside Expressway from pm this evening, Mr Braat said he was very acutely aware of the possible disruption ndash not just in his role as Lord Provost, but also as the local councillor for the area where many of the meetings and side events linked to the summit are being staged.ldquoWe know there could well be other disruptions with regards to a potential rail strike, he added. ldquoEveryone has the right to withdraw their labour in situations where they are feeling aggrieved or want to seek financial alleviation, but I have to stress the point that these are part of national negotiations that Glasgow does not have any direction or influence over.ldquoThe impact and focus of any potential strike will be on Glasgow ndash and understandably so. But, from my perspective ndash and I utterly respect the unions making that decision ndash I also want to balance out with the disruption that it will cause to the citizens of Glasgow who simply want to go about their day-to-day business so I hope that all parties concerned will take that on board during any further national negotiations.ldquoThere will also be some unknown disruptions, whether it is activists who may block roads. I think they are very passionate about what they believe in and Irsquom delighted that they are taking action and that finally their voices are being heard but, ultimately, because of the signicance of COP, we donrsquot have any alternative option. We need to have COP. Whether it took place here in Glasgow or where in the world we would expect to have some disruption even for the simple matter of having an event attracting dozens of world leaders, which has an impact on security as well and it will have an impact on residents.ldquoHowever, I hope that residents will see the ultimate benefit of that. If we can say at the end of COP that we have delivered a sustainable, green world plan that secures the long term and longevity of our planet, I hope that disruption will have been worthwhile.Glasgow is a city which is no stranger to protest and marches for causes and the Lord Provost recognises itrsquos everyonersquos democratic right to have their voices heard.ldquoThere are officially sanctioned demonstrations taking place, including a youth march, and they are important because peoplersquos voices need to be heard, he added. ldquoActivists should be there ndash they are there with the passion that they want to see real change and that is absolutely right. I will hopefully be joining in with that because I want to add my voice to their voice to highlight to the world leaders that they must make the tough decisions and bold ambition to ensure that we deliver on a proper agreement.Mr Braat said the city had been preparing for COP for months during a time when it has been handling the Covid crisis.ldquoWhatever has been asked of us we have done on top of having to make sure that the citizens of Glasgow have stayed safe during the last  months, he added. ldquoAs a local councillor and resident in Glasgow, I am fully aware that the state of our communities and the streets we live in are very important to most people. If they are not clean, people will make their voices heard, but decisions relating to that are not in my gt as the civic leader of the city. There are other people who have been charged with those decisions and implementing them, but I am also aware that some of these decisions arenrsquot easy to take.ldquoI have been in that position myself with the previous administration when I was the city treasurer. You have to make sure that resources are available against competing demands from ious departments and stakeholders. Beyond that, I canrsquot interfere as that would be inappropriate for me as Lord Provost, but I want to say I really respect the work that all of the councilrsquos frontline staff ndash and that includes the cleansing staff, the social care sector, and anyone  in the council and in the wider public sectors ndash have done for the city during the past  months to get us through the worst times of the pandemic to the place we are now.ldquoI go out into communities throughout the city regularly and I listen to their concerns and I try to help as best as I can, whether that is feeding that information back to the relevant departments or rolling up my sleeves and helping out with litter-pick events. Thatrsquos what I see as a role I can inhabit ndash showing support and bringing a message of hope. I think the city is ready to host the best but also the most crucial and important COP in history.It is in not unusual for the Lord Provost to turn up in his jeans and get on with the job of helping communities, groupswhether it is handing out food packages during the pandemic or handing out bowls of soup at a charity project in the city, as he did just a few nights ago.This week, Glasgow council launched its draft Green Deal roadmap for the city, a nine-year mission to transform the cityrsquos economy in order to tackle the climate emergency.The Glasgow Green Deal objectives are to reduce emissions and therefore climate risk create sustainable jobs and quality places eliminate poverty and deliver justice through inclusion and equality.Mr Braat said the legacy of COP for the city will be building a greener, sustainable, Glasgow ndash and that companies will be chapping on the cityrsquos door to be here.He said: ldquoThe way forward for any city in the world will be in the green sector, producing clean and green technology and investing in clean and green industries. Many cities around the world will be desperate to seek inward investment from such companies, but I am convincedwe have the Glasgow Agreement the benefits we can reap from that will be immense.Coming into post in January  after his predecessor Eva Bolander stepped down following a row over personal items she had claimed for on council expenses as part of her civic duties, Mr Braat says he feels his term of office has been dominated by the pandemic.ldquoI might have had plans and ambitions that I wanted to do and it might have been slightly dferent but I like everyone  had to adapt to the role. I had the choice. Do I sit back or do I go out and make a positive dference and for me it was case of rolling up my sleeves and going out in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt on helping groups and volunteers with food deliveries. It was my chance to thank people for what they were doing. What I will remember about this term of office is being able to go out and might so many people and listen to their family stories and connect with communities across Glasgow. I thank all the community groups, volunteers, frontline and key workers from all sectors for what they have done for the city during the toughest of times.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13070944.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cop26-road-closures-today-clydeside-expressway-m8-junction-closed","story":"The citys Clydeside Expressway and parts of the M will be closed to drivers from pm tonight, causing ersions of up to five miles.Alternative routes for drivers who travelthrough Glasgow have been issued by Glasgow City Council.The expressway section which is parallel to theOVO Hydrowill be shut for three weeks alongside junction  of the M.Follow @transportheraldThe junction is being specically used to escortworldleaders anddelegates travelling through from Edinburgh and outside Glasgow.Diversions, which couldtake drivers as far away as Anniesland, will spark extreme congestion in the city during the conference.An aerial map of Glasgow shows the full citywill be at risk of congestion, and a ten-mile stretch of the M will be signicantly busier than usual.Here are the road closures:Local Area Traffic Management Planshave issued day-to-day maps detailing road closures and areas with high risk of congestion.Transport Minister Graeme Day said: ldquoMany months of travel planning, and preparations are now entering their final, crucial phase.ldquoThis event will be unprecedented for so many reasons and will bring its own unique challenges for Glasgow and beyond.ldquoI would urge commuters, business and the public to take some time to read the transport plan and familiarise themselves with the road closures and latest travel advice.

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAW Orkney will need to be at full strength to meet this demand, and this award takes us a step closer.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There was a strong local representation too with young people from schools right across Armagh involved in proceedings. Organised by the Church Leaders Group , the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh, the Presbyterian Moderator, the President of the Methodist Church and President of the Irish Council of Churches all had a hand in the service. A heavy police cordon was in effect in Armagh and around St Patricks Cathedral from the early hours of the morning. Media from across Ireland had descended on the city for the service too, which was televised across the UK on the BBC and across Ireland on RTE. Before the service began, the Assistant Organist, the Revd Canon Dr Peter Thompson, played as guests arrived. The Cathedral bells rang as dignitaries arrived, including the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and the leaders of the DUP, UUP, Alliance and SDLP. The Queen, who was unable to attend, was represented by the Earl of Caledon. The opening hymn of the service O Christ the same through all our storys pages - played to the melody of Londonderry Air - was followed by a reading of scripture by the recently appointed Dean of Armagh, the Very Revd Shane Forster.  He read  Corinthians :-: Soanyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away see, everything has become new! All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. The Dean also welcomed everyone to the service. We gather here today on this ancient hill of Armagh, where St Patrick established a faith community and church over fteen hundred years ago, to reflect on the signicance of this centenary year and the long road we have travelled which also stretches out before us, he said. In this the ecclesiastical capital of this island, a centuries old place of learning and outreach, we meet together at this time, people from erse backgrounds and traditions, with dferent beliefs and aspirations, to pray for the healing of past hurts and to seek God’s guidance and hope for the future.  Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us, and yet it has also on occasion brought us together. As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light filled, prosperous and peaceful future. His following prayer spoke of how we as a people had wounded each other and our communities in the past. We are sorry and ashamed and asked for your forgiveness, so that together we may move forward in faith, grow together in love, and faithfully serve you all our days. Soloist Helena Hendron, accompanied by the gentlemen of the Cathedral Choir, sang The Deers Cry, before a reading from Isiah :- by Rebecca Morris. A song of hope, Were the Future of Tomorrow, was sung by a childrens choir drawn from the local area. That was followed by a reading from St Matthew :- by Oisiacuten Walsh. The hopes, dreams and aspirations of the next generation were then given to the congregation by Lucy Addis from the Royal School, Armagh, Sean McCourt-Kelly from St Patrick’s High School, Keady, and Andrea Andrews, a pupil of La Cheacuteile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown in Dublin. Prayers were read, with the opening prayer read in Irish by Linda Ervine and Seacutean Cull. Intercessions were offered by Professor Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the conflict. Reflections were then given by the Church Leaders, with the exception of the Methodist Leader, who was giving the sermon later. ‘In Christ Alone’, a hymn written by Stuart Townend and Keith Getty, who has links to the Armagh area, was then sung by the congregation. Rev’d Dr Sahr Yambasu, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, then gave his sermon, followed by the Act of Commitment, led by Rosa McCloskey and James Chamberlain, a pupil of Markethill High School. The most symbolic act of the service saw Billy Wilson, a pupil of City of Armagh High School, carry a lantern, representing a light of hope, through the Cathedral where it was received in the santuary by the Church Leaders.

The signicant benefits of vaccination are clear. It protects you and those close to you,” he said.“Even though we have now introduced the booster dose for those vaccinated at the start of the programme, it isn’t too late for those who remain unvaccinated to get their jabs.”The Minister thanked the sporting organisations who have “actively supported both vaccination and wider public health messaging during the pandemic.”“Ulster Rugby, GAA and the IFA have all made important contributions,” he said.Dr Deirdre Savage, GP at Castlereagh Medical Centre, said: “We are very grateful to Ulster Rugby for their support as we aim to vaccinate , patients over the next few weeks.“The Covid booster and flu vaccines have a vital role to play in protecting people this winter.

He said failure to act against “this blatant breach” would make a mockery of the church.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “May the Lord have mercy on His people in Ulster who have been given such poor spiritual and political leadership in these evil times,” he said.The DUP has been asked for a response. When contacted, Rev Foster said he would leave it to the Free Presbyterian Church to decidethere would be any internal sanctions against Mr Givan.He was asked why Paul Givan shouldn’t attend as First Minister when the Queen had felt it was appropriate before taking ill. “The Queen is not a Free Presbyterian,” he said. “The Queen is not someone who has sat up and said ‘I believe in the doctrines of the Free Presbyterian Church’.“She’s the head of the Church of England which is a dogsbody for every form of filthiness. That’s the truth, theologically speaking.”Rev Foster added that he “lamented” the appetite for protest from his church had dropped away in recent years since former First Minister and Free Presbyterian founder, former DUP leader Rev Ian Paisley, performed a “political somersault and entered into an alliance with Sinn Fein”.Those attending Thursday’s widely reported event also included Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney as well as the leaders of the DUP, UUP and SDLP.Free Presbyterian Moderator Rev John Armstrong recently said that “this upcoming event has been arranged to promote the purposes of unscriptural ecumenism when it ought to have been a service of celebration and thanksgiving for the Lord’s hand upon our country over the past  years”.Read MoreAlf McCreary:OpinionSadly, the absence of the Queen and Michael D Higgins will be remembered long after centenary church service eventRelated topicsPaul GivanUlster Unionist PartySDLPBoris JohnsonSimon CoveneyMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureDrug dealer Noel Johnston was living ‘hand-to-mouth’ in last years of his leMancharged with murder of former RUC officer Brian Coulter in MagherafeltRow over Irish language road signs erupts… in the RepublicGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceTop VideosPlayWatch all the times Nigel Farage has been targeted by republican pranks\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayVideo: Hilarious sketch creates Irish version of Squid GameLatest Northern IrelandStephen LooneyOpinionGlentoran fans may call for Mick McDermott to go, but the Oval manager has the safest job in Irish League footballSwann concerned about ‘confusion’ over face covering messagingMan charged over Co Londonderry murderNathan Doak doesn’t need guided through games… he’s already class, says Ulster Rugby half-back partner Billy BurnsThomas Anderson on swapping Ulster Rugby for the world of high-end fashion: ‘It was sink or swim’LatestInvestment topping more than £ billion announced ahead of BudgetNation urged to get Covid- booster ‘to protect freedom and Christmas’Man arrested over Manchester Arena terror attack bailedJodie Whittaker on filming her final series of Doctor Who during the pandemicRobert Lewandowski on target as Bayern Munich march on with - win,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stock image FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe deal allows New Zealand farmers to undercut British farmers by shipping in meat produced to lower welfare standards. Stock imageAmy CochraneTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland farmers have said that a new trade deal struck by the UK and New Zealand could “severely undermine” the market in Northern Ireland by allowing an influx of cheaper meat to be imported.The Ulster Farmers Union added that the family farm structure here has become “vulnerable practically overnight” and certain farming sectors have been “sold-out”.The deal allows New Zealand farmers to undercut British farmers by shipping in meat produced to lower welfare standards.It has been suggested that the deal could reduce the size of the UK economy, but with the effects unlikely to spread evenly, it could mean that Northern Ireland – which depends highly on the agriculture industry – could be hit worst.UFU president Victor Chestnutt said: “UK farming and local food production has been completely undermined by this New Zealand trade deal.“Combined with the Australia agreement at the beginning of this year, government has granted access to a signicant increase of imported food allowing it into our market, with no guarantees about how it was produced orit meets our world leading standards.”Mr Chestnutt said that it is “extremely concerning” for the red meat, dairy and horticulture farm sectors and for the public.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Our consumers – who take pride in supporting local farmers for the work that they do producing high-quality, trustworthy, local food, looking after the environment and boosting employment in rural areas – have been sold out too,” he said.“No attempt of communication was made by government as to how they would work to protect our local food production while trying to get a trade deal with New Zealand over the line.“Farm businesses across Northern Ireland and the whole of the UK, are already enduring substantially higher input costs in comparison to those farmers on the other side of the world and are dealing with ongoing labour availability.“It seems that government are either oblivious to what farmers are dealing with or have chosen to dismiss it as they have created unfair competition within our home market which will affect the sustainability of our family farms in years to come.”The UFU president is now urging the British government to adopt similar approaches to New Zealand and Australia, which invest in strategic farming, in order to safeguard and strengthen British agri-food production.“As it stands, it is very hard to see the positives of this trade deal and other countries will be watching this development with a growing drive to secure a similar agreement,” said Mr Chestnutt. “Government must explain the rationale behind this new trade deal with New Zealand immediately, highlighting how it will benefit UK agriculture, our world leading standards and the future of local food production.”Most ReadSam McBrideOpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureDrug dealer Noel Johnston was living ‘hand-to-mouth’ in last years of his leMancharged with murder of former RUC officer Brian Coulter in MagherafeltRow over Irish language road signs erupts… in the RepublicGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceTop VideosPlayWatch all the times Nigel Farage has been targeted by republican pranks\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayVideo: Hilarious sketch creates Irish version of Squid GameLatest Northern IrelandStephen LooneyOpinionGlentoran fans may call for Mick McDermott to go, but the Oval manager has the safest job in Irish League footballSwann concerned about ‘confusion’ over face covering messagingMan charged over Co Londonderry murderNathan Doak doesn’t need guided through games… he’s already class, says Ulster Rugby half-back partner Billy BurnsThomas Anderson on swapping Ulster Rugby for the world of high-end fashion: ‘It was sink or swim’LatestInvestment topping more than £ billion announced ahead of BudgetNation urged to get Covid- booster ‘to protect freedom and Christmas’Man arrested over Manchester Arena terror attack bailedJodie Whittaker on filming her final series of Doctor Who during the pandemicRobert Lewandowski on target as Bayern Munich march on with -

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings. He continued: The efforts that have been made by so many in recent months to drive up vaccination rates and step-up compliance with mitigations do seem to be working. It is vital that we dont let up. We must maintain our focus and collective endeavour.

There will be a range of goods and items on sale with over  exhibitors and visitors will be able to have a tea or coffee. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle Valley site is easily accessible from both the cityside and the Waterside and there is ample parking in the council car park adjacent to the location. The car boot sale is another initiative by Destined following the lting of the Covid restrictions and will be a fundraiser to support the activities of the group. Destined members with a learning disability will again highlight the positive work of the organisation by being centrally involved in the event by organising the stalls, managing the entrance and exit to the site for vehicles and pedestrians, hosting a tea coffee stall and offering for sale a number of items.     Paddy Arbuckle, the event organiser, said “We had planned to utilise the facilities here at the Foyle Valley prior to the lockdown but Covid got in the way, so we are really pleased that we could do this as a fundraiser to help our programmes.” For further information contact paddy@destined.ie  Long Tower nine-week Novena begins this Sunday  Martina Purdy will be one of the guest speakers at the  annual Novena    ‘Perfecting your pitch’ workshop organised as part of business recoveryinitiative in North West     Foyle to lose Eglinton and Claudy in proposed boundaries shake-up  Public urged to share their views  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Owner and barber, Claire Elish Craig, was nominated by herdaughter, Chloe, who posted on Facebook for Clare’s clients to fill out a survey and allow for Clare and her barbers to be nominated. googletag.cmd.push The decision is now down to an external judging  after Clare submits supporting evidence for her nomination. Clare said that the response to the survey andnominationfrom her local clients was “overwhelming. The business, open since , is Clare’s first barber shop. She said: “I have been hairdressing and barbering since I left school, some  years ago now. “I trained with James McGarvey who was my old mentor and master barber. He retired at the age of , that’s when I went out on my own. “I went on to do my advanced level and accessor award in barbering. I have given my all to this trade.     “I feel I have carried a lot of the values over from James offering value for money and a friendly ear for our customers.” Clare’s husband, Michael, has been a great support for her business, “My husband has his own job working with special needs children inArdansheeschool, but he is always organising things for me, my back bone.” The Derry couplehavethree children, and now threegrandchildren. Clare says her first born granddaughteris “a shining light.” Clare said: “She has shown us that nothing is impossible with all the obstacles that she overcomes. “Through the past year and a half, it’s been a nightmare for business. “We were closed for months, then opened briefly, then closed again. The cost to make the shop safe for customers, mentally, I thought, is this it  Will we ever be able to get back to business  Will the business still be there whenever we are allowed to open  “I was extremely scared with Covid when it was time to open again. I kept asking, will my customers be safe  Will my staff be safe  Am I doing the right thing  It was definitely very tough.” When asked what winning the award would mean to her, Clare said: “All the years barbering, to me personally, it would mean the world. “A lot of my clientswho were teenagers when I started, are now coming with their own children. In some cases, I have three to four generations from the samefamily. “My shop is just not another shop, it’s an integrationinto the local community where people come to have ahaircut,a chat, unload their worries, and I to them, and they sometimes have the occasional beer.” The award ceremony will beheld December  at the Europa Hotel in Belfast. Clare added: “I want to give a special thanks to my daughter, Chloe, for nominating me.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Capita were requested to attend a meeting at Derry City  Strabane Council to explain errors made by the company that affected people being able to access benefits that they were entitled to. googletag.cmd.push The firm was hired by the Department of Communities in  to carry out Personal Independent Paymentassessments. However, an Ombudsman report last June found Capita had “unfairly rejected” the applications of many claimants in the north of Ireland. The Public Services Ombudsman, Margaret Kelly, said that “repeated opportunities were missed to make the right payment as early as possible in the process” with evidence from medical professionals not being sought out and used by Capita in their assessments. Brendan Flynn of Capita addressed Derry City  Strabane District Council and apologised for the firms actions. He said: “Theres always a risk that we wont get things  per cent right all of the time.     “On the occasions where things do go wrong, we apologise, and we will continue to apologise and seek to put things right as soon as we become aware of any issue where we might have failed. We look to put in place safeguards, checks and balances and the continuous improvement processes to ensure those errors dont happen again.” However, Capitas apology cut no ice with Cllr Harkin who accused the firm of acting “callously” and called on Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey to strip them of the role of assessing benefits for people in need of them. He said: “Capitas administration of Personal Independence Paymenthas done great harm to vulnerable people seeking access to benefits.  People Before Profit demonstrating against PIP assessors Capita outside the Guildhall in Derry “The company has acted callously in its pursuit of profits. They should have no role in assessing whether or not people should be able to access any benefit. Capita isnt fit for this role. “Given Capitas atrocious record, its simply stunning that the Communities Minister decided the corporation should be rewarded with another multi-million pound contract through to . Coming into the role, axing Capita should have been number one on the list. “Its also unacceptable that the Minister refuses to implement the human rights Peoples Proposal, backed by  Councils including Derry and Strabane, to ensure dignied treatment to everyone seeking to access benefit help. “If this was a DUP Minister, Sinn Feacutein would be roasting them. Instead they tell us they have confidence in the Minister. “We are calling for Capita to hand over its profits to the Derry and Strabane hardship fund and other organisations working to mitigate the impact of poverty. “They should be ashamed to be lting profits following the devastating Public Service Ombudsman report. Companies solely interested in turning a profit shouldnt be getting their hands on extremely lucrative government contracts. “Capita needs to be booted out. The Peoples Proposal needs to be fully implemented. “We need to end the corrupt cycle of powerful corporations getting their hands on huge government contracts with the sole goal of squeezing out as much profit as possible no matter the damage caused to vulnerable people.” In response, a Capita spokesperson said: “We recognise and understand that the assessment process can be a stressful and anxious time for claimants.” “Our assessments are just one part of a wider process of evidence gathering on behalf of the Department for Communities and final PIP award decisions are made by the department. “All our assessors are qualied healthcare professionals including former NHS nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and paramedics, specially trained in assessing disability needs. The spokesperson said a sample of claimants are surveyed monthly following their PIP assessment by an independent research company. Over the last  months, more than  per cent of those surveyed have said they were satisfied or very satisfied with our service, the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said they were committed to improving the quality of PIP assessments and have already begun in doing so. They said: “These include the completion of PIP award reviews in-house, where sufficient evidence is available. This has reduced referrals to the PIP assessment provider by  per cent. “The department also employs health professionals who monitor the quality of assessments reports, and from August  the independent audit of cases has been brought in-house to provide a more robust oversight and scrutiny of the quality of service provided. “Where assessments are required, officials are working closely with the service provider to reduce the need for a claimant to attend for assessment. “Officials are also taking forward initiatives to enhance customer service in response to independent reviews that have recently completed, including the second independent review of PIP and a review of the management of the PIP assessment service contract by the NI Audit Office.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

The Verge hasreported that the site, which is worth nearly  billion as of last year,is planning to rebrand itself with a new name next week. It is understood that the site received the information from a source with direct knowledge of the matter. googletag.cmd.push Specically, the source claimed that Facebooks Chief Executive Officer, billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, plans to talk about the name change at the companys annual Connect conference on October . However, the source added that the new name could be unveiled sooner. In addition, the source claimed that the name change will signy the companys new mission to on expand the metaverse, which is believed to itsambition to be known for more than its social media presence. Previously, Zuckerberg told the site in July,that Facebook will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company over a number of years.     In response, Facebook said it does not comment on rumour or speculation. The rebranding would position Facebooks social media app as one of many products under a parent company, which will also oversee groups like Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Many news sites, including The Irish Independent and, as well as The Verge itself, have noted that therumours come at a time when the company is facing increasing US government scrutiny over its business practices. Earlier this month, a whistleblower named Frances Haugen leaked documents that showed that celebrities, politicians and high profile Facebook users were treated dferently by the company. Reports detailed that these leaks revealed that moderation policies were applied dferently, and in some cases not at all, to such accounts - a system known as XCheck . Another leak showed that Facebook was also facing a complex lawsuit from a group of its own shareholders. Soon after,Facebook and its subsidiaries, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Mapillary, and Oculus, became globally unavailable for a period of six to seven hours. A separate whistleblower and former data scientist for the company, Sophie Zhang, recently testied to the British parliament that the social media site is allowing authoritarian governments to manipulate political discourse.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

He creates dark ambient as An Trinse, lo-fi Techno as TFT and has the monthly show ‘First Trans- mission’ on Threads radio. He also works as a designer and animator who has created multi-disciplinary work for clients including Nike and Adidas.  What influences you  googletag.cmd.push “With the An Trinse project I’ve always thought of it as being indebted musically to the surrealism of Nurse with Wound and later Coil with a heavy dose of Irish history in there. “My techno records as TFT are much more straightforward and fit into the classic Dutch Clone Viewlex template or L.I.E.S. I’ve enjoyed handing over the visual side to Ben Lee who is an incredible designer. The current visual work with Maxwell Sterling stems from getting obsessed with Peter Greenway a long time ago and suddenly having an outlet for this baroque sensibility. “Max’s work is so rich and cinematic I was instantly inspired to find a way to create a version of the layered theatrical world of Prosperos Books mixed with images generated via AI with painterly elements and I think we have arrived at a pretty inidual visual soup.”     Any Irish stuff out there  “Some of my favourite Irish music of the last few years has come from the label Fort Evil Fruit, they have built up a formidable discography over the last decade across the spectrum of experimental sound. “Also, a big fan of From the Bogs of Aughuska as we share a love of the crossover of Irish History, drone, and black metal who I always thought deserved more attention, but I guess it’s a bit of a niche interest. “Recently been loving the unpronounceable Lighght from Cork who makes really eclectic danceable electronica”. How was your lockdown  “I can’t pretend I didn’t think it was the end of the world at the start but once we settled into the long-drawn-out boring apocalypse it has shaken up my work a bit. I was in great form, had just completed an An Trinse audio-visual show which premiered at one of CTM festival in Berlin’s associated events in January and was hoping to tour the projects throughout the year plus was in the process of setting up a celebratory gig for my split album with Il Santo Bevitore. “I had also just worked on the visual direction of the NME awards which was one of the biggest projects I had overseen. “That all went in the bin along with my main revenue source working as an editor and animator in the creative industry, so it was a very scary few months till everything stabilised a bit. I tried to use the time to collaborate with artists on music videos which crazily ended up helping on Kylie Minogue’s online show and directing a piece for Yousef and Gorgon City. “I also ended up exhibiting work in some online exhibitions which has led to my current work with the Most Dismal Swamp collective but there was a lot of staring at the wall wondering where it was all going. “Later in the year, I did some online gigs including a collaboration with Bratislavan artists Monika Subrtova which felt gooda little weird staring in a camera in an empty room. The project with Maxwell came out of lockdown as well, we were both working on a video project with architecture collective The Decorators who were similarly trying to find ways to show work when everyone is stuck in the house. “That project has just been shown at the V  A museum at the London Design Festival which was a bit of a dream come true.” New normal  “I’m hoping that the show me and Maxwell are doing at MIRA festival in Barcelona is the start of something positive for the new year. We were slightly shocked to get booked so early as we had so far only presented an embryonic version of the show once and was a bit of a disaster technically. “We have done one more show since and its light years ahead now and very excited about presenting it on m screens.”  Any music over there you’d recommend  “Well i would definitely say check out Max’s new album ‘Turn of Phrase’, I’m extremely excited about working on the live presentation and its without doubt one of the best albums of the year. “My pal Yaws is also putting out some wild bendy tempo electronics that you will struggle to pin down. “Also,anyone is interested in the world of digital art and experimental music, I would check out Clot magazine ran by my wonderful other half.” www.clotmag news performance-maxwell-sterling-stephen-mclaughlin-a-v-at-space--london  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

And while it is important that the jobs of staff are secure, itrsquos also important that they have a sense of consistency and the opportunity to advance in their careers, he said.ldquoThe sad reality is that many of our staff are now burnt out a result of their work over the past  months. We need to sort out how our healthcare heroes are paid a wage that reflects the work they do and that they have proper working conditions.Mr McGrath said taking a critical look at how the ongoing waiting list is funded is also critically important which he also described as a priority moving forward.ldquoThe simple matter is that people are having to wait too long to see a consultant and the waiting lists are getting ever longer. This cannot go on, he declared.ldquoComing from a rural constituency we need to address how rural healthcare services are delivered and methodologies such as the community pharmacy can be supported in a way that enables them to challenge our rural health care needs.ldquoWhere this concerns the Downe Hospital specically is that it is essential that we have the services that meet the needs of the community. What I hear from people on the ground is that the Downe is ready to play itrsquos role,it was only supported from central government to do so.Mr McGrath said he is also conscious that many people are fearful about the future of GP services and are concerned that they cannot see their doctor.ldquoOur GP services have never been busier and our doctors work all day, every day. But the system is broken and needs to be fixed. There are many issues that are so important and need investigated and enhanced such as mental health, youth mental health, perinatal care, cancer services and more.ldquoAs I take up my partyrsquos health spokesman role, I am fully aware of the responsibility it involves and will now be endeavouring to meet with all of those stakeholder groups who I know will be instrumental in being a part of this. Irsquoll be meeting with the public to hear their thoughts as well.Mr McGrath added: ldquoA post-Covid society offers us many opportunities, but we have to seize them and make them work.

This time it was Eilis Murphy who found her effort crossing the line after evading any resistance the Kilcoo defence had to offer.However, it was not to be plain sailing for Downpatrick, as immediately the Magpies sought to get a foothold on the contest.Kilcoo responded through a Caitriona Kane free, which was a reoccurring theme throughout the match. And one minute later, Kane once again converted from a free as her side began to enter the tie.There was a notable battle between Downpatrickrsquos Turley and Kilcoorsquos Laura Morgan, as the two tussled in what was a case of who wanted control of the possession more.Some neat triangle passing allowed Hoops forward Aisling Flynn to notch her first point of the game, before Adair Trainor overturned possession to release Cara Tumelty, who added further to RGUrsquos tally.Kilcoo displayed their class through Kane after an array of eye-catching passes found its way to the boot of the number , resulting in an applauded point.The scoreline would have been much closer at this stage had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of player-of-the-match Kirsty Carling, who saved magnicently to deny a certain Magpies goal.Yet again Downpatrick did not allow themselves to be discouraged by the opposition, as Tumelty responded promptly with another point to close the scoring before the first water-break.The Hoops picked up where they left off as Tumelty pointed from a free after the restart, although her next effort just went the wrong side of the posts.Mulholland was in fine form as she dribbled past two opposing Kilcoo players to allow Tumelty to score a trio of unanswered points for her Downpatrick side.With  minutes gone, Kilcoo began ramping up their attacks and were nearly rewarded when Ceallach McEvoy played a lovely weighted pass over the RGU backline to allow Johnston through on goal.Showing the Downpatrick defence a clean pair of heels, Johnston seemed certain to put the ball in the back of the net. But, it was that woman Carling again who pulled off a terric save from point-blank range to a keep daylight between the sides.Mulholland pointed from a free at the other end of the pitch before Kilcoorsquos Kane replied with the same to keep her team present in the contest.The halftime whistle sounded to leave the scores - to - in favour of Downpatrick.It was very much a game of two halves as the teams ed to the pitch after the interval with Kilcoo immediately winning the throw-in before setting off on the charge downfield.Kane kicked over a point from range before Johnston secured another for the black and white outfit.A couple of wides occurred for both sides within the next few minutes, although the weather did take a turn for the worse, with rainfall and windy conditions beginning to increase.Kilcoo continued their onslaught with a Morgan point from open play, as Downpatrickrsquos Flynn saw her effort drt narrowly off the mark. But theMagpies continued their pressure and were soon awarded with a free  metres from goal.Dearbhla McGreevyrsquos effort ped just under the crossbar and was now causing all sorts of bother for Downpatrickrsquos Carling.The Hoopsrsquo number one watched the shot all of the way but could only slap the ball into the path of the onrushing Ceallach McEvoy, who bundled it over the line in the last piece of action before the second water-break.A terric  minutes for the Magpies meant that there was just a single goal separating the sides in the last quarter with the score - to - in favour of the Hoops.There was now a tense atmosphere both from the players on the pitch and the surrounding supporters, who had turned out to watch the final.Downpatrick goalscorer Murphy kicked over a point to finally get her side off the mark in the second half, although this was promptly answered with a fine solo point from the ever-present Johnston.As the clock ticked down, the tie was still very much in the balance when Tumelty registered another point to add to her impressive personal tally.With one last throw of the dice, Kilcoo charged down the pitch but was met with a plethora of green and white shirts who forced Kane to shoot from distance and settle for the point.That signalled the last score of the game as the final whistle was blown to cue pandemonium from the Downpatrick outfit and their management team.After the match, Downpatrick joint senior ladiesrsquo manager J R Loudon reflected on his sidersquos performance and season as a whole.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable, we took these girls way back in February and this was their end goal, he said. ldquoTheyrsquore a great bunch and we have a  of around  to  players. The feeling in the club as a whole at the minute is fantastic.ldquoMost of these girls are of minor age as wersquove lost a lot of our more experienced players to other commitments, so what they have achieved is remarkable.The manager added: ldquoWe knew Kilcoo were going to play using a sweeper, so we wanted to force their lsquokeeper into a long kick out that we were confident we would win.

This is just one of a number of similar incidents against council staff which have taken place in the area over the past few months.It is believed the people responsible for the recent attacks are members of a teen gang that has been running havoc in the village since before the summer.The same gang has been blamed for the brutal killing of a cat, which was burnt alive in the village last month. Its burnt carcass was left on display with a beer can between its paws and a cigarette in its mouth.One local resident recently claimed that people in the village are living in fear of the gang that continues to vandalise and destroy property in the village.

Today, the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee is due to endorse a plannersrsquo recommendation to give permission for four new homes to be built on a quarter acre sloping site it owns at one of Killyleaghrsquos biggest housing developments.Council officials have earmarked a strip of open space land in front of homes at Grove Gardens at the Kerry estate located off the Downpatrick Road for the new homes.Ten letters and one petition objecting to the proposal were submitted to planners with the scheme part of the local authorityrsquos plan to sell off surplus land and buildings it owns across the district to generate cash.While the council does not build homes, residents opposed to its plan believe that the local authority is seeking planning approval which will signicantly increase the value of the land which it can then sell to the highest bidder.The plannersrsquo recommendation to grant outline permission for the land at Grove Gardens has angered residents and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker.It was confirmed earlier this year that none of the statutory agencies consulted about the proposal had objections, with the local authority pointing to the need for additional social housing in Killyleagh and a lack of available land to build new homes .In addition, the council contends that redeveloping the small portion of land at Grove Gardens would have ldquominimal impact on existing open space land and that the housing proposal will improve the estate physically and the attractiveness of Grove Gardens, ldquoproviding a quality and sustainable residential environment, better parking provision, a new vehicle turning area, additional footpaths and wider roadway.However, itrsquos a view not shared by residents or Cllr Walker who lives in nearby Grove Park.He said while arguments not to develop the land have failed, he is encouraging residents to object to any subsequent planning applications for full permission which will inevitably be forthcoming.ldquoThe case has been made by residents and myself that this piece of ground is simply not suitable for four homes, but planners disagree with us which is disappointing, he continued. ldquoWhile opposed to this proposal, I remain a passionate supporter of social housing and have worked alongside others to provide much-needed new accommodation and identy potential development sites.ldquoWhat we are talking about here is a proposal to make Newry, Mourne and Down Council a quick buck. This particular area of land is not suitable for social housing. I have no doubt thatan application to build private homes at this part of Killyleagh it would be refused.The Rowallane politician said while social housing provision is ldquoabsolutely critical given recent news that there are , people across the district looking for homes, the Grove Gardens site is inappropriate.He said that several years ago, along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, the pair were able to persuade roads officials to widen the road in front of existing homes at Grove Gardens to ensure emergency vehicles could gain access.Cllr Walker said while the local authorityrsquos outline planning application will be rubber-stamped later today, there is still some way to go before builders can move on site. He added: ldquoExisting homes at Grove Gardens would overlook the planned four semi-detached properties and I believe there is an issue in relation to peoplersquos privacy. Clearly, the planners donrsquot agree with me.ldquoI remain perplexed that planners view a piece of sloping ground as suitable for new housing. It is not in my opinion and, along with residents, I do not support to this proposal.

A local campaign group mdash Portaferry Stop The Chop mdash applied for a tree preservation orderafter Ards and North Down Council rejected their alternative plans which would have reduced the number of planned parking spaces by nine, but saved most of the mature trees.The Department for Infrastructure confirmed this week that it is considering whether or not to make a TPO to protect trees, with a spokesman confirming that before deciding the matter, the Department must first consult with the local authority.ldquoFollowing formal consultation, the Department is now awaiting the views of council, the spokesman added.The matter will be discussed at the full council meeting next Wednesday with the organisation planning to invest pound, to clear the Portaferry site in order to create a new car and coach car park, new toilets, paths and lighting improvements in the Ropewalk area.The project aims to provide improved facilities for visitors to Exploris and the village and is viewed as a much-needed improvement in the wake of the planned poundm aquarium at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. This proposal will mean that Exploris will no longer be the only aquarium in Northern Ireland.The new car-park, which has received funding from the Department for Infrastructure, should have been completed by November, but the council succeeded in getting an extension to the funding until January. However, Cathie McKimm from the campaign group, claimed that the council had wrongly given itself approval to remove the trees.ldquoThe council had not done environmental screening in its plans, which they are now doing and gave themselves unlawful permission to chop down the trees, she explained.ldquoWhen we wrote to the DfI, the planning headquarters wrote back to say that under the new legislation introduced in  when responsibility for planning transferred to councils, Ards and North Down was not allowed to give itself permission to chop down trees on land that it owned in a conversation area.She said that the council applied on September  to remove the trees which was followed up by the campaigners applying for the TPO.ldquoAll we know is that the trees are not saved yet, the original proposal is still on the table, said Ms McKimm.ldquoI have no confidence in this council to listen to what the community wants. Nearly , people signed a petition against this proposal and we reckon  per cent of those are from the Ards and North Down Council area.The group held a free concert, headlined by musician Colum Sands, at Portaferry Community Centre last Sunday in order to raise more public awareness of their concerns for the trees.Last year, the Co Down songwriterrsquos story-poem about the award-winning Invisible Tree of Rostrevor Oakwood, was given voice by neighbours and environmental campaigners aged from nine to  in the short film, Rhyme for Justice .Ards poet, Moyra Donaldson, wrote a poem for the  trees at Portaferry which was read out at the event, along with other poetry inspired by the local area.Lily Devlin, who started the campaign to save the tree, said that she and other campaigners in Portaferry have been ldquohumbled and inspired by the great support they have received in their campaign to save the trees, not just from local people and those from the Borough, but from all around the world.Speaking on behalf of the group she said: ldquoOver , people have now signed our petition mdash a testimony to the strength of opposition to the plans to destroy beautul trees in the heart of our historic town, for a car park, of all things.ldquoWersquove been trying as best we can to reason with the council over this absurd decision and get it to reconsider its plans but, to date, it has not taken its proposal to fell  trees for new parking off the table.A council spokeswoman confirmed that an updated report on the Portaferry Ropewalk Improvement Scheme will be brought to the full meeting next Wednesday and will include consideration of the Department for Infrastructurersquos proposals for a TPO in the area.She stressed that the council had not been aware of the need to get planning permission from the DfI for the removal of the trees until August.ldquoThis legislation had not been referenced by DfI Planning in any previous correspondence with the council about the proposed Scheme, she said. ldquoThe legislation requires the council to gain consent from DfI Planning for works carried out to any trees on land owned by the Council and within a conservation area.ldquoThis is anomalous with the Scheme of Delegation that DfI Planning has already approved for the council in relation to the decisions the Planning Committee can determine.

In the absence of both John Donnan and James Simpson, Bradley Luney started in the second row and Jack Milligan came in at out half with Greg Hutley moving into midfield to cover the loss of Tagen Strydom.Shane Ball and Paddy Wright swapped positions as Adam Craig and his coaching team searched for the right formula in attack.Trinity were fresh off a demolition of UCD in the colours match and were able to choose from a full squad with Leinsterrsquos Liam Turner in midfield and highly regarded Ulster Academy prospect Harry Sheridan in the second row.Leinster senior squad regular Jack Dunne continued his rehab from injury with a place on the Trinity bench.Ballynahinch started badly with handling errors and a misfiring line-out inviting pressure.Despite some high quality scramble defence, they found themselves seven points down after a series of Trinity carries pinned them on their own line and quick hands and some good footwork took Max Faria over for a converted try.This was compounded by the loss of Milligan and prop Ben Cullen to injury.Another excellent defensive set allowed Ballynahinch time to dig in and they began to take the game to the students as the half wore on.A strong maul earned them a penalty on  minutes which Hutley knocked over from  metres to get his side on the board.Turner made a brilliant break just before half time but more superb scrambling kept the half time deficit at just four points.Ballynahinch had much the better of the opening exchanges of the second half and after going close to scoring a try, another Hutley penalty left the game delicately balanced.Turner then stamped his class on proceedings with a superb outside break on the Ballynahinch -metre line, opening up the defence for winger Marcus Kiely to score. Trinity then turned up the heat in the forwards and sealed the result with a close range try from a fine line-out move involving Dunne and Sheridan in the st minute.Thirteen points down with  minutes to go, Ballynahinch could have folded but they gamely stuck to their task and showed all their fighting spirit by attacking the Trinity line.They were rewarded with a try from Hutley on the gamersquos final play as he exploited the numerical advantage in the Trinity backline following a yellow card. He then calmly knocked over the conversion to salvage a point for his side.Despite opening with three defeats, Ballynahinch have shown improvement with each match and will be confident that they can soonto winning ways.They have a week off to regroup and rehab some injured players before the visit of table-topping Garryowen to Ballymacarn Park on October .Ballynahinch: B Cullen, T Stewart, K McCall, T Donnan, B Luney, Z McCall, O Loughead, C Irvine, C Gibson, J Milligan, A Cairns, G Hutley, R Wilson, P Wright, S Ball, J Hanlon, H Simpson, T Martin, D Souza, C McAuley, R Patterson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"UUP selects Macauley to contest Assembly election  ","story":"THE Ulster Unionist Party has selected Jill Macauley to contest next yearrsquos South Down Assembly election.A former Newry, Mourne and Down councillor, Mrs Macauley has secured the backing of her party and received a ringing endorsement from leader Doug Beattie.Mrs Macauley mdash who is a member of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council mdash said she is ldquodelighted to have secured her partyrsquos nomination to contest one of the five seats up for grabs.At the  Assembly election, Harold McKee was the UUP flag bearer and polled , votes, with the party confident that it can make a serious push for a seat when voters go to the polls next May.Based in Rathfriland, Mrs Macauley is one of the UUPrsquos most senior figures and having served as a councillor in two local authority areas, she now feels the time is right to ldquostep up and give the electorate of South Down a chance for change and a chance for positive and hardworking -pro-Union representation at Stormont.She described her work as a local representative as a ldquoprivilege, allowing her to meet and work with ldquosome wonderful people and great organisations within the constituency who do sterling work to support local communities and those most in need.Mrs Macauley revealed she has been working hard over recent months to grow the local UUP membership and said the optimism and resolve for a ldquomore confident and inclusive unionism has allowed her to continue working effectively with her party colleagues on a range of issues.She said these included the childrenrsquos funeral fund, transfer test, school unorm costs, disability and special educational needs improvement and period poverty.ldquoWe have a fantastic hardworking team of local councillors, working on the ground, always accessible and working for the greater good of local people, said the Assembly candidate.ldquoI want to thank my fellow councillors for the help and support they have given me thus far and encouraging me to step forward for election to the Assembly and the opportunity to lead our local team, as we strive to continue to be the strongest voice for Unionism right across South Down.Mrs Macauley said she hopes to prove that she is on their side and will be a strong voice for positive, confident Unionism.She added: ldquoFrom Katesbridge to Kilkeel and from Warrenpoint to St Johns Point, I have a bold, positive, ambitious vision for our people of South Down and am prepared to work with anyone to make that a reality.ldquoFor too long, we have been trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and ision, resulting in every election becoming a constitutional show of strength rather than a mandate for socio-economic change.

Did the other church leaders not know he was going to speak in that way  If they did, why did not one of them gently contradict him with another view  Photo by Jonathan Porter   Press EyeIn no way did it celebrate Northern Ireland. It was a cross-border church service about partition. Indeed the organisers were at pains to say it was not a celebration.Fine. Butit is going to be entirely neutral about Northern Ireland, then a separate service of thanksgiving of our country should have been held this year.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It would be essential to have a royal at such a service of thanksgiving for one of the four home nations of the United Kingdom.On Thursday there was no royal presence, all the more regrettable given the snub of the service by President Michael D Higgins of Ireland, a man who has several times scolded Britain for its history.The most striking comment at the service was by the Roman Catholic Archbishop Eamon Martin, who spoke pointedly of the pain and loss in his community at partition.BBC Northern Ireland led Thursday’s TV evening news bulletins not on this much-discussed service but on a tragic story about a sex attack victim. It then introduced its report on the service by highlighting the criticism of Archbishop Martin.While I think this showed troubling editorial judgement, the BBC could argue that the archbishop’s criticism was the most notable comment of the day. After all, Archbishop Martin was not countered, even obliquely, by the other churchmen who spoke. Why not Did their communities not also suffer great pain, for example in the Troubles Given the scrutiny of this event, did they not know Archbishop Martin was going to say that  He wrote an article in the  this week that included stinging criticism of Northern Ireland’s history.Andthey did know, did not one of them think that a dferent and positive assessment of Northern Ireland should be aired in light of that very public criticism, which became BBC NI’s lead line This was by far the biggest Northern Ireland centenary event to date after a year in which there has been no major occasion to rejoice in the country that the great majority of the population here love and identy with .If it was not for the Covid restrictions of this year, the timid handling of the th birthday of Northern Ireland would be a scandal. But even given that context of limits on gatherings the approach to the centenary has been pitul. We now have big sporting events and rock concerts taking place. Yet the centenary of this wonderful country of almost two million people has been much less visible than the publicly funded annual West Belfast festival, which ended this year in another concert at which a crowd chanted IRA slogans. Today we report on the barriers that Sinn Fein has put in the way of centenary events . But they are allowed to have a veto, so we need the UK government to step up to the mark. Yet its showcase service seemed to have little direct association with Northern Ireland. It was asit was about the northern half of Ireland or maybe just about Ireland. Perhaps it was about global peace.It had lessons in Irish, prayers in Irish, other phrases in Gaelic too. Some fine Irish music. All good. But I saw little that was recognisably British at the service. If it was important to have Irish culture represented, then why not British, given that the unionist population takes such comfort from the existence of Northern Ireland  The Union flag — representing the nation which has sovereignty here by popular consent — was missing apart from Boris Johnson having it on his mask. Nor did I hear much that you might describe as distinctively Northern Irish .The Methodist president Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu referred to the slavery of St Patrick and the later slavery from Africa, saying people’s colour was used to diminish their humanity. He condemned the partition of that continent . Rev Dr Ivan Patterson talked of the need to hear the voice of NI’s dferent ethnicities and traditions. This is true. But the service did not mention our generosity to immigrants, and the new lives Northern Ireland has offered them.There were references to climate change but none to the scientists, engineers and business folk who shaped our  years as a distinct jurisdiction on this island. Or the leaders who, for the first  years of NIput it decades ahead of the  independent counties in matters from infrastructure to the welfare state to elementary rights such a orce. No references to the sports people, actors or other luminaries who have reflected our sense of ourselves as a distinct society.You might say a church service is not a rollcall of achievements. But it should at a minimum have had a specic reflection for the many people who from  gave their lives in service of Northern Ireland, a country that was expected not to survive but has lasted a century.I felt almost surprise when the Anglican Archbishop John McDowell described his working class unionist roots as “an immensely rich culture”. He was quick to add that his mother had “a strong sense of Irish identity” too.A rare moment of recognition of our country was when the Presbyterian moderator Dr David Bruce said “I love” Northern Ireland . In fact it was one of the few times I heard the words Northern Ireland uttered.If church was not the place to champion Northern Ireland, what other planned event will  The Feile crowd was estimated at ,. Where is the NI centenary event of such scale  It was bad that no royal was present. The Queen is blameless for that. Aged , Her Majesty is  years older than the retirement age of  for working women of her generation, yet her ongoing commitment to public duty is beyond doubt. It transpired that she spent Wednesday night in hospital and we all wish her well.But why was no senior royal’s diary cleared long ago for October , so they were on standby in case a monarch of such advanced years was unable to travel I consider all of the royals blameless for the absence. I have reported on most of them on visits here and do not doubt their commitment to this part of the UK. It is the government that should have made clear to the royal family the value they attached to an NI ceremony, particularly after the Higgins snub.Instead, our biggest event was a service that seemed to follow a Northern Ireland Office view of NI as a place that is neither British nor Irish, and the history of which is best left unmentioned, unless it is criticised as sectarian.See Billy Kennedy, page  of the Weekend Print edition• Billy Kennedy: Queen’s absence left a huge void at centenary service• ‘Sinn Fein determined to start culture war with unionism’: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

The Queen’s health-related absence from Thursday’s service sent nationalist commentators into hyper driveThey could send one of their members over to London armed with a pair of binoculars and a notebook to look out for ravens.Specically, they could position themselves outside the Tower of London and watch for any signs that the six resident ravens there might about to leave the famous castle on the north bank of the Thames. Because as the legend goesthe conspiracy of ravens eventually depart for good from the Tower then not only it but the entire kingdom will fall.Andthe ravens fly away the #Think  or New Ireland ‘twitchers’ will see that as somehow proof positive that the Union is now definitely doomed.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIf you think that imagined scenario is a little bit outlandish then reflect not only on some of the wilder speculation on social media but even within the pages of a Sunday newspaper last weekend about the Union’s future. One writer speculated that when the Queen eventually dies the Union could be plunged into peril. While across outlets like Twitter nationalist commentators and the usual trolls went into hyper drive when it was announced that the Queen would not be attending the ceremony at Armagh Cathedral to mark the th anniversary of Northern Ireland’s foundation.Never mind that the monarch is -years-old and apparently in such frail health that her doctors recommended she miss the event. Following that medical advice it emerged later that the Queen had been admitted to hospital in London for tests.None the less some in the media conjectured that the Queen’s non-attendance was in reality linked to Irish President Michael D Higgins’ boycott of the ecumenical religious service that somehow the absence of the British monarch avoided the “embarrassment” of only having one head of state at Armagh from these islands for all those photo-ops inside and outside St Patrick’s Cathedral.Meanwhile, on social media networks incredulity was stretched even further by those who interpreted the Queen’s non-appearance as somehow a slap in the face by the London establishment for unionists.Like the biblical star shining in the east the monarch’s absence was seen as a sign that the Brits have started their exit strategy from Northern Ireland. Which is almost as ludicrous in terms of logic and evidence as the thesis advanced last weekend that the passing of the current monarch also heralds the break-up of the UK.Amid all this frenzied wishful thinking it is important toto the facts. This type of hysteria has been fuelled by Brexit and especially the weaponisation of EU membership to advance the cause of Irish unity. However,you analyse the results of four credible opinion polls from the year the UK voted to leave the EU it is clear there has been no real tangible “Brexit-effect” on support for staying in the UK.The  Ipsos Mori poll taken after the Brexit vote showed support for the Union being over %.A year later a survey for Queen’s University Belfast found almost exactly the same backing for the Union, again more than %.Two years later in  the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies also found more than % in favour of staying in the UK.In  the Northern Ireland Le and Times Survey reported that % still opted for the Union rather than a united Ireland.The reasons for this solid base support for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK it is fair to presume are not based on intangible factors such as widespread genuine admiration for the Queen or love for the monarchy.Other far less ethereal or symbolic causes come into play here: the desire to stay in a nation with the fth largest economy in the world the free at point of use NHS the support system via the Barnett Formula provided by the UK Treasury to poorer regions including Northern Ireland a state that is multi-cultural and erse and the deeply ingrained visceral historic, familial, social connections that straddle both sides of the Irish Sea.Conversely the two-tier, American-style semi-privatised health system in the Republic the Irish State’s mounting national debt, the highest in Europe a punishing personal taxation regime and a resurgent neo-nationalism brought on in part by the decade of commemorations are among the repellent factors that will convince many to remain within the UK rather than link up with the Republic.These are the dynamics that will determine the future of the Union rather than who sits on the throne across the water. To posit the end of the longest reign of any British monarch could hasten the break up of the UK, or even that her non-attendance at a single event is a signal that it is already happening, is as absurd as waiting for the ravens to fly off from the Tower of London.• Ben Lowry Oct :Centenary church service should have celebrated Northern Ireland• Ruth Dudley Edwards Oct : I stand by my assessment of Fathers Gerry Reynolds and Alec Reid• Henry McDonald Oct : I am an atheist but I miss hearing Preacher Man on the streets of Belfast• Owen Polley Oct : The EU didn’t even try to address the assault on NI’s place in UK• Peter Robinson Oct :  Any unionist praising the Good Friday Agreement is a heretic• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Oct : Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’• Henry McDonald Oct : The biggest task for unionists is to get out their non voters• Henry McDonald Sep : For all the gushing attitudes to the EU in Dublin, Brussels can’t rely on Ireland to help it with an EU army• Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Yet across Northern Ireland, people can be reassured that they are bathing in clean and safe waters.Second, lockdown has produced a renewed interest in the province’s outdoors. It is one of the upsides of the Covid rules that we have reconnected with NI’s countryside and waters. In particular, there has been an upsurge in outdoor swimming at locations such as Helen’s Bay on the northern coast of Co Down, one of the beaches rated excellent.Swimmers are taking a dip through the winter there.Now that the beaches are reaffirmed as being of bathing quality, our politicians should be thinking of how we can increase insufficient parking space at popular beauty spots where cars are often being turned away. We should encourage those people who want to enjoy the simple pleasures of rural and coastal Northern Ireland.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, despite broad support, the project was vetoed by Sinn Fein on the grounds that it reflected “only one political perspective”. Earlier this month Sinn Fein, the largest bloc on Mid Ulster Council, blocked three landmark buildings being illuminated blue and green, along with a number of others across the UK, to mark the NI centenary.SF councillor Niamh Doris said she opposed the “celebration of something that deserves no celebration, which is the partition of this island”.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLeaving the main car park and tramping pavements along Heol Gorllewin to pass the Prince of Wales pub, which features in the tale of the Maid of Sker, the group then entered the southern part of the vast Kenfig Burrows. These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why. What did I want from le  What was important to me  I had no idea.Ms Hall, who has three daughters ndash aged , , and one ndash began to lose interest in herself and others and stopped taking care of herself she isolated herself and drank too much alcohol, trying to hide from le.She was getting ill but thought it would pass. Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book. I hope it helps one or more people ndash I had to hit a wall to get help, but you donrsquot have to do that!Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work is available at Grfin Books in Penarth and online via Amazon.Itrsquos had positive feedback which you can read at https:amzn.to vqNVbuGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
