This was set up by her mother Slavica Ecclestone —Bernie\u0027s former wife — in 1997 and raised £3 billion by selling shares in Formula One.Slavica and her daughters, Tamara and Petra, are the beneficiaries of the trust.The three women have been made so wealthy by the trust that Slavica — who orced Bernie in 2008 — blew £12 million on Petra\u0027s wedding to first husband, James Stunt.And there is nothing that goes down quite so well on Instagram as monumental excess.Tamara habitually shows off the fruits of her unfettered spending on social media, including a lavish £150,000 birthday party in June at which naked cowboys served tequila shots.There was speculation yesterday that her status as the blingiest woman in London might have made her a target for raiders, alerted to her leaving the property hours earlier when she posted pictures of her family aboard a private jet en route to Lapland.But friends insist the robbery is not connected to social media. \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s got anything to do with her posting a picture of getting on a jet,\u0027 said the source.Be that as it may, father Bernie has been repeatedly dismayed by his flashy daughters — and their flashy husbands.The son of a Suffolk trawlerman, the 89-year-old former chief executive of Formula One is a workaholic and has no time for ostentation. His favourite meal remains egg on toast with brown sauce and, when they were growing up, his daughters didn\u0027t have a nanny or housekeeper.Bernie built up his fortune during his 40-year reign over world motorsport. In 2017, U.S. giant Liberty Media completed its £6.4 billion takeover of the sport, and Bernie was appointed chairman emeritus.Over the years, the Ecclestone family has fallen victim to numerous criminals. Bernie was mugged in 2010 on a London street, with £200,000 of jewellery taken.In 2016, his mother-in-law was kidnapped in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but released ten days later without any ransom being paid.Daughter Petra had jewellery worth £450,000 taken in 2013 from her house in Belgravia by a burglar posing as a prospective home buyer. He was later sentenced to eight years in prison.Meanwhile, the men in the lives of Tamara and Petra have also had brushes with the law.Jay Rutland, a former City trader who works for an art gallery, was accused in 2016 of helping a fugitive drugs baron — serious allegations that could have landed him in jail for up to seven years had the charges not been dropped for lack of evidence. Mr Rutland strenuously denied the allegations.         Husband Jay was in a less ecclesiastical mood, opting for a more pointed barb on the social media site which seemed to imply he knew who was behind the raid: \u0027I know u are lying, but continue\u0027 Three days after returning from their honeymoon in June, 2013, he was robbed at knifepoint at a petrol station in East London and had his £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet stolen.Meanwhile, Petra\u0027s first husband James Stunt has been accused by Petra of being a fantasist and an art fraudster. Stunt, from Surrey, is a bullion dealer and art collector and his godfather is Terry Adams, the convicted money launderer and alleged gangster.Now bankrupt, Stunt told police he was the victim of a £90 million heist in his Belgravia home in 2017.But officers closed the investigation months later and no arrests have been made.Last month, open hostilities broke out between Petra — now engaged to former car salesman Sam Palmer — and Stunt.Petra married Stunt in 2011 and they had three children before orcing in 2017.She called Stunt \u0027horrible and narcissistic\u0027, adding: \u0027The man is not a billionaire and never was. Naively, I funded his life for our entire marriage.\u0027She added that Bernie had loaned him £10 million for his \u0027failed gold business\u0027 and said that Stunt \u0027spent most most of his days in bed high on prescription drugs\u0027.She said that he had threatened to kill her and expressed the hope that her unborn baby died of Aids. She added: \u0027The sad reality of it is James is not a gangster . . . he\u0027s just a prat.\u0027Stunt later responded to her accusations, describing them as \u0027falsehoods\u0027. He added: \u0027Petra, it\u0027s very sad that you\u0027ve had to tell so many lies.\u0027One daughter at war with her ex the other heartbroken by theft.As Bernie is no doubt sick and tired of being reminded, money sure can\u0027t buy happiness."},{"url":null,"title":"John Bercow cashes Speaker fame signing dinner speech agency","story":"Share this article It came days after his general election night punditry on Sky News – for which he was reportedly paid £60,000 – when he again used the phrase.Mr Bercow has wasted no time in launching a media and public speaking career since he stepped down from the Speaker\u0027s Chair on October 31.

As his shots are published, he recalls the politics, parties and soaring price tags of ‘Matey Boy’One Christmas, Steve Lazarides and Banksy decided to kill Santa. “Reject false icons,” read the slogan hastily spray painted across their shopfront, behind a highly festive effigy they had created of Father Christmas dangling from a noose. Dotted around were signs intended to lure passersby into their shop, in the hope that they would join in the party and buy some artworks. The signs, however, may have had the opposite effect. “Santa’s Ghetto,” read one. “Stinking art piss,” read another.“There were a few complaints about what we did to Santa,” says Lazarides, once Banksy’s right-hand man. “And about the noise. We didn’t care. It was a group show we did every year, so artists could make a little dough and punters could pick up some affordable art for Christmas stockings.”Lazarides worked with Banksy for 11 rollercoaster years, initially documenting the artist at work back in 1997, then becoming his agent, strategist and even minder. The Christmas art shop had been rented from one of Soho’s last porn barons – but disaster struck. Liquid leaked through from the floor above, soaking an impromptu chandelier made of traffic cones. “I went to investigate,” says Lazarides. “It was a toilet overflowing. The crowd at the party thought it was part of the show. It wasn’t. It was literally stinking art piss.”The art he and Banksy sold at Santa’s Ghetto was certainly affordable back in the noughties – but it could not be classified as such today. Lazarides recalls carrying armfuls of original Banksy prints to the shop, where they’d shift for £25. “At today’s rates,” he says, “I reckon each armful would be worth about half a million quid.”One work, called Bomb Middle England, depicted three elderly women playing bowls with balls that had lit fuses coming out of them. In 2007, Sotheby’s sold a version of this image for £102,000, at the time the most ever fetched for a Banksy. It has since been eclipsed, with the title now held by the 2009 painting Devolved Parliament, which went for £8.5m earlier this year.While Lazarides is happily reminiscing about the Santas of Christmases past, Banksy is on the streets of Birmingham making art about the scandals of Christmas present – in the form of his mural and video of two reindeer pulling, not Santa in his sleigh, but a homeless man called Ryan lying on a bench in the city’s jewellery quarter.“How do you define greatest?” says Lazarides. “By money? No, by recognisability. And by that criterion, he is the greatest. Forget Warhol, forget everybody except Rembrandt and Van Gogh. He’s a genius.” As proof, he cites Girl With Balloon, the painting that shredded itself moments after being sold for more than £1m at Sotheby’s last year. (“Performance art of the highest order.”) And then there’s the union jack stab vest Banksy designed for Stormzy’s showstopping Glastonbury performance last summer.Lazarides has now self-published a book of his photographs from the time he travelled the world tasked with making sure Banksy didn’t get arrested or duffed up and didn’t run out of spray paint. “I had the time of my life,” he says as he sits on the roof of his London office, talking about the man he calls Matey Boy. “We were lawless and did just what we wanted. Matey Boy had a political agenda that you can see very clearly in everything he does, but I just had a fucking blast.”He met Banksy on an assignment for Sleaze Nation magazine, where Lazarides was a photographer. “I was from Bristol like him and loved graffiti art – it was for the dispossessed, those of us who didn’t go to galleries or have private educations. So it was a meeting of minds from day one.”How come you two were never arrested? “The secret,” he says, “is hi-vis jackets and traffic cones. Nobody stops you if you have them.” However, there was a morning in New York’s Meatpacking District (“before it was gentrified”) when a few transgender sex workers took exception to Banksy painting a wall. “Some of them misconstrued what he was writing as homophobic and called the cops. That’s about as close to getting arrested as we got.”He and Banksy had various scams to help them get away with things. “Once I gave him a letter saying he had permission from a film producer to paint a wall. And I would be the film producer, armed with a burner phone. If I got a call, I was primed to say, ‘Sorry mate, I meant him to do the other side of the street.’”The book is called Banksy Captured and consists of Lazarides’ photographs of the art world’s favourite enigma at work, whittled down from his collection of 12,000. The book’s first edition of 5,000 copies sold out within days of publication, promoted through Lazarides’ website and Instagram. Orders were processed by his “fulfilment ision”, meaning his mum and stepdad working in a Bristol warehouse. “She got made redundant from the chip shop, so this gives her another career.”Now copies of the book are selling for up to £600 on eBay. A second edition is ready go and a follow-up volume will go on sale in the new year, this time featuring Banksy’s work in Los Angeles and beyond. “I might even do a third,” says Lazarides, “if I can find where the files on my hard drive have gone.”Banksy has given Lazarides the go-ahead to publish these intimate images. But that brings us to the big question: who is Banksy? Bristol artist Robin Gunningham, Massive Attack’s Robert del Naja, Gorillaz founder Jamie Hewlett, a creative collective? “I’ll never give him up,” says Lazarides. “It’d be like telling a four-year-old Santa doesn’t exist. If he did reveal himself, no one would believe him. They’d be like, ‘Course you are, mate, course you are.’”All of which makes it somewhat surprising to hear that Lazarides and Banksy don’t talk any more. Was there a falling out? “Not really. I’m bipolar and he’s obsessive. We’d gone as far as we could together. There is, I think, still a great mutual respect between us, though. There are texts, emails. We don’t talk because we don’t need to.”Among the pictures in the book is a shot of London’s Hayward Gallery defaced with Banksy’s eloquent spray-painted comment: “Boring.” Lazarides says: “That sums up how we felt about the art world. My theory is that one of the reasons why he’s the world’s most famous artist is that he isn’t making people feel stupid, unlike most current art. I never got into art theory, never did a degree. And I never liked being told what I liked. So much art is about that snobbery.“There are so many people working galleries who couldn’t give a fuck about art, who’re only in it for the money. I tested that theory recently in Hong Kong at a gallery I won’t name. I said to the guy, ‘Tell me about this painting.’ He said, ‘Well, it’s worth $6m.’ That’s the art world.”In this, Lazarides is gamekeeper turned poacher. He opened his first gallery on Soho’s Greek Street in 2004, later expanding his empire with two other galleries nearby. The aim, he says, was to ensure street artists he admired didn’t get exploited by the art world. “Know what happened to the kids who invented tagging in the 70s? They got bought up by the white-bread downtown art world – and got fucked, turned into freak shows. I wanted to make sure it didn’t happen again.”In this way, Lazarides turned Banksy into a bankable commodity for collectors and helped a whole new generation of street artists – Invader, JR, Vhils, the Miaz Brothers – to sell their work. Last year, he launched Lazinc in Mayfair with, reportedly, a seven-figure investment by Qatari billionaire Wissam Al Mana (the estranged husband of Janet Jackson).How could street art be sold in Mayfair without losing its soul? When he was asked this last year, Lazarides denied that his artists sought to smash the system. “Even Banksy isn’t really anticapitalist,” he said. This September, though, he quit Lazinc, citing art world snobbery and saying: “I never wanted to sell fucking paintings. The only reason I did it was to promote a subculture that was being overlooked and is now gone.”Where’s it gone? “There’s energy out there,” says Lazarides. “It just needs harnessing without snobbery and cynicism. I’m 50 now and a boring old fart. But I want to be knocked on my ass by some 20-year-old genius.” He thinks he can make that happen by getting out of Mayfair and working at it totally online, convinced that bricks-and-mortar commercial galleries have only five years left. “I’ve got no overheads. I can hit and run.”He’s selling prints of his photographs on his website, with prices starting at £450. “Affordable art, like we did back in the day. I want to use this as a model for how to sell artists’ work. No third parties. Just me and the public. I can be an art world gangster again.”• Banksy Captured is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11745d071fe880a0f9dc89907104ea72078be0eb/75_0_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d99988b9e14d57553794decbd4035de1","title":"london resort theme park thames estuary brexit","story":"With its rickety rides, fire-breathing dragons and Arthurian castle, the enchanted realms proposed for the Thames Estuary park are little Britain writ large. Will its High Street have a closed down library?A circular building topped with a union jack dome rises from the trees on the Swanscombe peninsula in Kent. With its flag tightly wrapped around a glass bubble, it looks like a little Brexit capsule, safely sealed off from the free movement and free markets of the outside world.This is the proposed entrance pavilion to the London Resort, a £3.5bn theme park planned for the Thames estuary. This walled kingdom of themed “lands” would rise from the muddy marshes by 2024, just as Boris Johnson nears the end of this term as PM. The first images of this planned dreamland were unveiled a few days before the election and the project now seems like a fitting metaphor for the result. Why elect a government that would address social welfare, tackle rising homelessness and fix the NHS, when you can build a parallel fantasy world instead?Working in partnership with Paramount Pictures, BBC and ITV, on behalf of a Kuwaiti developer, the team have concocted a perfect vision of little Britain that will bring a tear to even the most steely of Corbynite eyes. After being drawn into the great union jack glass tent, visitors will be funnelled into High Street, a place “full of shops and restaurants” – like actual British high streets used to be. Maybe there’ll be an empty library and an interactive food bank experience, too.From High Street, punters can progress to The Studio, described as a “gritty, modern-day warehouse district”, similar in fact to the cluster of industrial sheds that are already on the site. To the north lies The Woods, “an enchanted realm” with a whiff of Thomas Heatherwick, where elfin creatures roam the forest and garden bridges miraculously sprout from rivers.Next is The Kingdom, promising a full-on feudal experience. It will be the best of British, where the landed gentry lord it over the peasants from heavily fortified castles, recalling the good old days before we joined the EU, and to which we’re returning having taken back control. Images show a magnificent Arthurian pile, topped with crenelated towers and flanked by fire-breathing dragons. A rickety wooden rollercoaster swirls around in contorted loops, while a medieval trebuchet-shaped ride swings ominously to and fro in the background.The menu of enchanted escapism goes on. Next comes the The Isles, a place of “giant creatures, mythical beasts and adventures at the crossroads of imagination and reality”, as well as The Jungle, where ancient ruins of a long-lost civilisation (the welfare state?) will be visible through the tree canopy. Marvel at overgrown relics and “strange mystical artefacts” (is that social housing?) transported to the present by inquisitive explorers.The final land, Starport, will catapult visitors into a thrilling future, with high-octane rides, alien encounters and sci-fi stardust. The developers say it will launch people into adventures that are out of this world, “leaving them mesmerised at things that should be impossible but are not”. Sounds painfully familiar.First mooted in 2012 and subject to endless delays, the London Resort now looks to be back on track. Having dropped out in in 2017, Paramount is back, and the project is now headed by PY Gerbeau, the theme park whizz credited with turning around the fortunes of both EuroDisney and the Millennium Dome. The park’s long-awaited arrival now seems a welcome prospect. By 2024, it might be the escape from reality that we will all desperately crave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf755506d35920fe0711a1dab45f5e1ecd68563d/0_228_1181_709/master/1181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88ccf1450e8006c18432fef3afe97394","title":"post boxes of the lake district in pictures","story":"On one of his yearly trips to the Lake District with his family, Tom White spotted his next project in the post boxes scattered throughout the national park.

More than 700 Max jets are now grounded worldwide. It is the first time in 20 years that Boeing has halted 737 production and the move could have significant repercussions for the US economy.Boeing is the US’s largest manufacturing exporter and a shutdown would impact suppliers across the country, hitting the country’s already troubled manufacturing sector. The suspension has already led to the cancellation of thousands of flights scheduled by airlines that were awaiting new planes or had bought ones that are now grounded.The Seattle Times reported on Sunday that the board was considering a proposal from top management to temporarily shut down 737 production in Renton, Washington from January. Boeing as yet has no timeframe for restarting production but plans to redeploy its 12,000-strong Renton workforce.Boeing has said if it did not receive approval to begin deliveries before the end of the year it could be forced to further slow production or temporarily shut down the Max production line, a move that would have repercussions across its global supply chain.On Thursday, Boeing abandoned its goal of winning approval this month to unground the 737 Max after its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, met FAA administrator Steve Dickson. Dickson said on Wednesday he would not clear the plane to fly before 2020 and disclosed the agency had an ongoing investigation into 737 production issues in Renton, Washington.Dickson said there were nearly a dozen milestones that must be completed before the Max returns to service. Approval is not likely until at least February and could be delayed until March, US officials told Reuters last week.Boeing had said last month it expected the FAA would allow it to resume 737 Max deliveries in December.The FAA told congressional staff in an email last week Dickson was “concerned that Boeing continues to pursue a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic ... More concerning, the administrator wants to directly address the perception that some of Boeing’s public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc49a067a841d26d707d1f89579272278392972/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78de5f4c7310ec8157eb2fe1ff08ba7c","title":"market value of top uk firms up 50bn as post election rally continues","story":"FTSE 100 posts biggest one-day gain since week after EU referendum in June 2016Britain’s leading companies have seen their stock market valuation rise by almost £50bn after the post-election rally in share prices gathered pace.In a second day of hefty gains, the FTSE 100 index shrugged off evidence that the economy was struggling in the run up to polling day and closed 165 points higher at 7,519.05.Shares in the City’s leading quoted prices have risen since the election despite the strengthening of sterling, which depresses the value of profits made by the large number of FTSE 100 companies that do business outside the UK.The stock market has been boosted by a combination of factors – the prospect of an end to Brexit uncertainty, the removal of the threat of re-nationalisation following Labour’s defeat, and hopes that the interim trade deal between the US and China signals a rolling back of protectionism.London’s strong performance was part of a global trend that saw all three of Wall Street’s major share price indices lifted to record highs amid optimism of stronger, faster growth. Chinese share prices hit a six-week high and oil prices also rallied.Adding to the upbeat mood were weekend remarks by US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who said an interim trade deal was “totally done” and that it is expected to nearly double US exports to China over the next two years.Some investors cautioned against overconfidence. “It’s good news but we can’t celebrate yet,” said Mark Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners and former executive chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group. “This agreement is dependent on the degree to which the Chinese comply,” Mobius said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb162fe2d0090c46c3ae04ac1d5757fb32605b1/1_88_1715_1029/master/1715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64b582553d000d39eaaf81aabbcb9899","title":"transport operator firstgroup weighs up sale of us businesses","story":"U-turn comes only months after group said it would focus primarily on US bus operationsFirstGroup is considering a sale of all its North American businesses, in an apparent reversal of strategy only months after the struggling transport group said it would focus primarily on its US bus operations.The group said it had appointed advisers to explore options, including the potential disposal of First Student, which operates about 43,000 yellow school buses, and First Transit, which provides outsourced public transport.The third US ision, Greyhound, which operates the famous intercity coaches, was put up for sale in May.The turnaround comes after FirstGroup was announced the winner of the West Coast Partnership franchise in the UK, which secures a longer term future in rail.

Last month they called on the group to jettison the plan announced in May and sell off the US isions.Gregory said: “Today’s announcement to formally explore all options to maximise value from our North American businesses reflects the resolute focus of the entire board on realising value for all shareholders.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200deffc48d715c8e35f89166b4c0a8a01ced9ac/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32351b69f255de4e47b2e18a517278d3","title":"lib dems tories split vote labour","story":"The party’s only achievement was to split the vote. It should now merge with Labour and become a moderate influenceNo, it was not just Jeremy Corbyn. Last week’s crushing defeat of the left was also caused by the Liberal Democrat party splitting the vote. Yet again, by offering itself as the vote launderer of British liberalism, it has served as merely the fellow traveller of British Conservatism. Boris Johnson owes it a huge debt of gratitude.As for the election being a “second referendum” on Brexit, anti-Brexit or second referendum parties won more votes than did Johnson, even assuming all Tories were pro-Brexit. Yes, leave voters appear to have swarmed to the Conservatives, notably in the north, and are thus probably short-term. But the Lib Dem vote soared by 1.3m or 4.1 percentage points, while Corbyn’s fell by 2.6m. Johnson’s rose by only 304,000. The reality is that the left-of-centre vote was calamitously split. Polling during the campaign saw Labour surge only when the Lib Dems appeared to collapse.With the exception of the Tony Blair era, Labour has been persistently vulnerable to moderate leftwing sentiment defecting to the Liberals. Somehow such voters feel they can exonerate themselves from guilt by association with socialism without overtly siding with conservatives. They can comfort themselves that they voted “a curse on both houses”. In reality they did not. They effectively voted Conservative, or in a very few Lib Dem seats, they voted “hung parliament”.With the Lib Dems leaderless and in disarray, it must be time for them to do the honest thing and disband. They should reverse the old 1983 SDP marriage, and merge with a revivalist Labour. It would galvanise Labour’s moderate wing and dilute the influence of the Corbynites.The Liberals have never looked like winning an election since Lloyd George’s day. They have offered an electoral dustbin between political polarities, a media-cosseted Westminster club with a peerage auction for richer donors on the side. Liberals failed to capitalise on regionalism or nationalism. They were never truly radical, and in coalition were a broken reed. For the past year, the party has been a convalescent home for wounded warriors from the major parties, a gesture voters have treated with derision.This party is an anachronistic political spoiler. Its time is surely over. Liberal Democrats should disperse and confer their moderating influence on two bigger parties, who badly need it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70dc7311c7d0cb33fdbf9b6ec0a51b3cffdc09a1/0_50_5512_3307/master/5512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08c2d0375cd43b58e5cbed17527aca0","title":"task labour members face listen candidates","story":"It’s vital the party gives an honest hearing to all the candidates before choosing the new leaderAs the Labour party gears up for another leadership election, the field comes into focus: Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are certain to run. Richard Burgon has both said he will and he won’t Keir Starmer hasn’t and will. Emily Thornberry was always hotly tipped, though may have been torpedoed when Caroline Flint allegedly accused her of calling “red wall” voters stupid. Yvette Cooper is still in the mix, as are Angela Rayner, Clive Lewis and David Lammy. They criss-cross all the obvious faultlines – Blairite versus Corbynite, authentic Labour versus metropolitan elite, Len McCluskey stooge versus independent mind and, of course, leaver versus remainer. Beyond those caricatures, however, are some genuinely interesting questions about the party’s future.Phillips is the right’s candidate. This may seem unfair, as on some issues, such as migration, she has taken a far more progressive position than would be considered typical of the right of the party. Indeed, she has surpassed much of the left on this. But her positioning is centre-right. She has charisma if any centrist candidate could muster their own entryists (centryists, we’re calling them), it would be her. Indeed, that’s her only obvious path to victory – a mass join-up of Jess Phillips superfans – since it’s hard to imagine existing Labour members swinging to such a different candidate.Lisa Nandy was deeply opposed to a second referendum, wedded to the line that the first one was the ultimate act of democracy, and had to be protected from those trying to stop it. However, unlike almost anyone else of that view, she is personally popular with remainers as well as leavers. Calling her the Blue Labour candidate would be an oversimplification, but there’s certainly an element of that ideology to her worldview, which appears to be that the white working class of the left-behind north are fundamentally different to their peers in the cities, and only when the Labour party understands and prioritises them will it rediscover its soul. Her problem will be what happens when she’s head-to-head with Rebecca Long-Bailey, if Unite still backs the latter.But will it? Long-Bailey is currently the favourite, the choice of both McCluskey and John McDonnell. Until six months ago it was taken as read that the members would naturally fall in with whomever the inner circle anointed. So, it seemed, there would be a coin-toss between Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner, who were both put at the centre of the election campaign. But what a poisoned chalice that was: they are both now tainted with having to make the case for Labour’s weak Brexit position, neither fully leave nor fully remain, and both undermined by that squirrelly equivocation that is the hallmark of the loyalist (the same holds for Burgon).The bitter rows over what was wrong with Labour’s Brexit position are easily resolved by the data: it lost nearly twice as many votes to pro-remain parties as it did to the Conservatives and Brexit party combined. But even had the deserters been mainly leavers, that would have been no vindication for those who were sent out with a neither-fish-nor-fowl offer that nobody wanted to eat. That doesn’t mean that Long-Bailey and Rayner are without promise, but they could both use some clear blue water between themselves and Corbyn if they’re to be judged on their own merits. There are rumours that Rayner is considering going for deputy instead, perhaps mindful of this. Nobody will have Corbyn’s 2015 boon of being the only leftwing candidate on the ballot.It is very difficult to see how Yvette Cooper could present herself as anything other than a return to the pre-Corbyn era – as disappointed as they are, there’s no sign party members are wishing for that. Thornberry has better differentiation from the old days, but was more compromised by her time in the shadow cabinet, especially in the runup to the election, when the party Rees-Mogged her.Keir Starmer has been the face of remain, but given the views of the members, that isn’t the problem that Lexiters think it is: rather, he faces the irrefutable charge of not being female. Some of this is plainly disingenuous. The Corbyn circle had no problem at all employing a lot of white men, plus their children andor ex-girlfriends, yet is happy to point the finger at other factions. While “it has to be a woman” isn’t a universal view across the party, there’s certainly a sense that you need a very good reason not to be one. Starmer’s other task will be to persuade members that he’s not a technocratic, centrist, north London lawyer rather, he’s a political radical who has seen the merit in the Corbyn project and wants to extend it beyond the man. Clive Lewis is seen as leftier, and has great green credentials, but he’s quite a maverick and may yet decide that there are other positions in which he could be more radical and adventurous.David Lammy is popular in his own right, and an increasingly impressive orator, with years of parliamentary experience. Plus, there’s this blindspot about race in the debate: Labour’s ethnic-minority vote was rock solid, but there have already been calls for the party to focus its efforts on the “white working class”. A good way to corrode the soul of a party – perhaps the best way – is to bank the people who actually support you and chase everyone else. Lammy doesn’t bank these voters. And now we have a card-carrying bigot in Downing Street, a strong anti-racist opposition leader will be vital.

And I thought it wasn’t right. Even after all the years since, it wasn’t OK for women to be amazing.”So began an energetic campaign to right that wrong, initiated by Evie’s mother, Anya Pearson, and using the slogan “Mary Anning Rocks”.In a little more than a year it has attracted the support of thousands of people online, raised thousands of pounds and recruited an impressive roster of patrons including Sir David Attenborough, Prof Alice Roberts and the novelist Tracy Chevalier .This week they are hoping for another boost to the campaign. In a happy coincidence, Ammonite, a film about Anning starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, was filmed in Lyme Regis this year, after which the filmmakers made a donation of £15,000 to the town. On Tuesday Lyme Regis town council is due to decide how that money should be spent, and many local people have argued in favour of the statue.Pearson said she started the campaign because “to be honest I felt ashamed about it. I saw my daughter get really angry that this incredible woman had not got recognition in her home town. I just couldn’t get my head around it.“It’s very easy to sit back and just accept these things, but sometimes it just needs somebody to take up the mantle.”Her motto was “Go big or go to bed” – and go big she did. The Natural History Museum has thrown its weight behind the campaign, with its head of Earth sciences, Prof Richard Herrington, declaring that a statue in Lyme Regis “would be a fitting tribute to a woman who changed the face of geology”.Despite so far having raised only a fraction of what they will need, Pearson is already talking to a number of leading sculptors, insisting there is one point on which the team will not compromise. “We want a female sculptor. End of.”Mary Anning Rocks is not the only good cause hoping for a slice of the filmmakers’ cash: seven other groups have put in bids, including a local cancer charity that wants to erect a respite beach hut, and a scholarship fund in Anning’s name to help disadvantaged local young people study Earth sciences.Even if the statue campaign’s bid is successful on Tuesday, it will still have some way to go in funding a project expected to cost a high five-figure sum at least. The campaigners plan to start crowdfunding in earnest in the new year and hope the film’s expected release in 2020 will turbo-charge their efforts.A spokeswoman for See-Saw Films, the company behind Ammonite, said it had made the donation “because it was very important to us to shoot in Lyme Regis where Mary Anning lived and we had such great support from the residents of Lyme”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/963c297ba7bdd3913ecb295283c64a1d50d8f57f/21_132_5123_3075/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffdddba8271dc29f14495e37c0cf6dfc","title":"jeremy hardy remembered by rory bremner","story":"17 July 1961 – 1 February 2019The impressionist and comedian on the beloved comic whose deadpan style and fearless politics marked him out as one of the most original voices of his generation• Nell Gifford remembered by Helena Bonham Carter• Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2019 in fullOn my first ever tour, of small theatres and student unions in 1984, Jeremy Hardy was my support act. It should have been the other way round. “Middle-class comedian from Surrey”, the poster described him, quoting some underwhelming review. But that was Jeremy’s style. He wore it like the cardigans he would wear on stage, always unfussy, unshowy but funnier than all the rest of us put together. “People say I’m self-deprecating,” he’d say, “but I don’t think I’m very good at that.” He’d shuffle on to the stage, sometimes in front of a quite intimidating late-night crowd, and announce himself. “My name’s Jeremy Hardy. I’m going to make you laugh. Going to make you cry. Play your cards right, I’ll make you breakfast.” Fellow comics would watch and wonder at his ability to charm and defuse audiences with the sheer quality and originality of his material. It’s no exaggeration to say his downbeat, deadpan style inspired a whole generation of standups on the 1980s cabaret circuit.But his apparent diffidence masked a brave and fearless commitment to justice and political causes, from the miners to the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six, and later the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, about which he made a memorable documentary.Brought up in Mytchett in Surrey (“a small suburb of the M3”), he enjoyed and parodied that peculiar Englishness of the old black-and-white films (his favourite self-image was as Wilfrid Hyde-White, being wheeled round the ward in his pyjamas, saying: “Everyone’s been very kind”). But his distaste for the twee and complacent attitudes and the cant of the privileged middle classes found an outlet in the inspired, brilliant and peerlessly funny “rants” that marked his radio appearances from Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation to The News Quiz. No subject was spared his irreverence: politics, social attitudes – even the crucifixion (“People blame the Jews. But I’ve got lots of Jewish friends and they’re all hopeless at DIY. They could never get a cross to stand up like that, not for three days”).Apparently spontaneous, his flights of imagination were in fact brilliantly conceived, fuelled by genuine rage or exasperation and unfailingly, show-stoppingly funny – Peter Cook funny – often featuring voices and accents for which he had a remarkably good ear. Particularly remarkable, considering his appalling singing, which became a highlight of his appearances on Radio 4’s I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue.Radio was Jeremy’s medium, suiting his unassuming style. Fame and fortune mattered less to him than causes and friendships, his support of Jeremy Corbyn combining the two. Even in the late stages of his illness, he joked of appearing at rallies as “the two Jeremys”. He was so admired and loved by his fellow comedians, his sense of mischief lighting even the darkest moments. At his great friend Linda Smith’s funeral, as mourners were asked to cast flower petals into the sea and “take the moment to remember Linda”, he turned to Mark Steel and said: “Thanks for that. I was thinking of remembering General Franco.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

The EU pledged to end overfishing by 2020 as part of changes to the common fisheries policy agreed in 2013.“What we’re seeing here is a very similar dynamic to previous years,” said Andrew Clayton, a project director at the Pew Trusts. “Despite the legal deadline and the independent scientific advisers publishing their advice months ago, heavily lobbied member-state delegations seem to be haggling for higher quotas, using new ‘science’ and socioeconomic justifications to inflate catch limits in the short-term. We’re hearing that the tonnage numbers are already creeping up on day one of the talks.”Quotas for North Sea cod were halved at a meeting last week after warnings that stocks had plunged. The European commission had argued for a deeper cut but the fishing industry and ministers would not agree.The annual Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting to decide quotas was supposed to be a thing of the past, under the reforms of the common fisheries policy that were enacted in 2013 after years of talks. Under those changes, by 2020 the setting of fishing quotas was to have been governed by scientific advice on the maximum sustainable yield, and the quotas set for several years at a time in advance.But ministers failed to embrace those changes in practice, and the horse-trading of these annual meetings is ongoing, with decisions taken on a short-term and political basis based on countries’ perceived self-interest rather than the best long-term plans to conserve stocks.Decisions from this year’s meeting are expected in the early hours of Wednesday morning.One of the big issues at these talks will be the impact of the discard ban, which is meant to stop the wasteful practice of fishermen throwing away healthy, edible fish at sea because they exceed their quota. Evidence from civil society and government monitoring suggests many fishermen appear to be ignoring the ban.Fishing groups say the ban is respected but are concerned about “choke species” – species for which fleets are granted little or no quota, but which if found in a catch mean the vessel must stop fishing for the species for which it does have quota.Barry Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said Brexit was unlikely to be a big factor in these talks. “I think the UK will be aiming for a balanced approach that makes progress in fishing all stocks at high sustainable yields but which also avoids chokes in mixed fisheries,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f61a7969dea6f5dcd96bddd93cfc0cc2f3ed113/0_513_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b9ade12a30e151dbbf01c02e179a90f","title":"two giant fatbergs removed from sewers in central london","story":"Water company issues Christmas plea for customers to stop pouring fat down drains Two huge fatbergs together weighing almost 100 tonnes and threatening to cause floods in homes and businesses over Christmas have been cleared from sewers in central London.Thames Water said a fatberg weighing 63 tonnes – several tonnes of which was concrete – was cleared from a Pall Mall sewer after being broken up by engineers with power tools and by hand.Another weighing 30 tonnes and stretching 70 metres was removed from the sewers of Cathedral Street, near the Shard.The two fatbergs were threatening to cause wastewater flooding over the festive period, the water supplier said.Fatbergs are formed when fat, oil and grease are poured down sinks and drains and combine with items that should not be flushed down the toilet, such as wet wipes, nappies and cotton buds.Thames Water asked people not to “feed the fatberg” over Christmas, saying the two discoveries served as a timely reminder about the importance of properly disposing of cooking fat.Stephen Pattenden, Thames Water’s network manager, said: “Fatbergs are like monsters from the deep, lurking and growing under our feet, and the team worked around the clock to defeat these two before they could cause damage to our customers or the environment.“We’ve all seen the problems and damage they cause, and I’d therefore ask everyone to please make sure they don’t pour fats and oils down the sink.“By letting the fat cool, putting it in a proper container like a glass jar and then in the bin stops a fatberg growing into a monster.”The two fatbergs were disposed of months after Thames Water had to remove a 100-metre “Concreteberg” from underneath Islington, while a 40-tonne fatberg the size of a double-decker bus was cleared from a Greenwich sewer in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b2d7d640cc671bc41212659b08fe19924c45e1/0_97_2562_1538/master/2562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af060242ebd67396501ed7e5042eef46","title":"number of brumbies in alpine parks more than doubles in five years","story":"Conservationists condemn New South Wales government as feral horse numbers increase by 16,000 since 2014The feral horse population in Australia’s alpine national parks has more than doubled in the past five years, with conservationists blaming what they have called a disgraceful lack of management by the New South Wales government.The updated population figures come from an aerial survey of the alpine national parks and surrounding state forests in NSW and Victoria conducted in April and May of this year. It mimicked a survey of the same area in 2014.The population growth was strongest in the northern section of Kosciuszko national park, which showed a five-fold increase.Andrew Cox, chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, said that if feral horse numbers continued to increase at the current rate, horses would become the most-sighted animal in the park.“It is a disgrace to see how much the population has grown out of control,” Cox said.Cox said the exponential growth meant that authorities would have to remove thousands of horses a year just to keep the population stable.He said all humane and effective forms of population control – including aerial culling, which has been explicitly ruled out by the NSW government – should be back on the table.“If we don’t do it, horses will be the main animal you see there,” he said. “Australia’s most iconic park is being lost to horses.”The driving force behind the change in the NSW policy was deputy premier John Barilaro, whose electorate of Monaro includes the Snowy Mountains.Barilaro said he remained opposed to aerial culling.Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morning“I have never ruled out culling if the numbers show we need to,” he said in a statement. “But what I have ruled out is aerial culling of wild brumbies because, I stress, I won’t let this be a repeat of the Guy Fawkes massacre.”The culling of more than 600 horses at the Guy Fawkes national park in north-western NSW in 2000, where at least one horse was found alive with a bullet wound, is frequently cited as an argument against aerial culling. But aerial culling is commonly used against feral horses in remote parts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia.Cox said the Guy Fawkes incident had been mythologised and exaggerated. He said the damage to native flora and fauna, including the critically endangered northern and southern corroboree frog, would be severe if horse numbers were not curbed.Attempts to trap and retrain brumbies have resulted in a relatively small number being rehomed. About 800 have been trapped in recent years.“You can’t just take a few hundred horses out, there needs to be a serious control program put in place,” Cox said.Failure to do so will have negative animal welfare impacts on the brumbies themselves, Cox said. They are already being hit by cars.“The horses will overflow the park and spill into surrounding private lands if we don’t do something to control their numbers,” he said. “They have no natural predators, they have no diseases. They will starve themselves out.”Barilaro said brumbies had been part of the Australian alps for almost 200 years, since they were released by or escaped from European settlers.“I have always maintained that it is important we find a balance between the cultural significance of the brumbies and managing the environmental impact on the Kosciuszko national park,” he said.A community advisory panel has been formed to help draft the wild horse management plan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ada344cdd4084052f251845c76968060b14def7/0_121_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fcd4e4c144adf79af0136fe2c44a3b8","title":"anna karina french new wave icon godard a life in pictures","story":"The Danish born actor, who was to become one of the icons of French new wave cinema in the 1960s, has died at the age of 79.

In his 100th match as the Crystal Palace manager, the 72-year-old had seen his side run ragged by Graham Potter’s impressive team and was staring down the barrel of a third successive defeat to their bitter rivals after Neal Maupay’s seventh Premier League goal of the season.Yet Hodgson has not been in this game for more than 40 years without learning a thing or two and it was the visitors who were left hanging on for the draw after Wilfried Zaha’s brilliant equaliser – his sixth goal in 11 matches against Brighton – ensured Palace remain three points clear of their not-so-near neighbours in mid-table. “It was a wonderful gutsy, resilient, determined performance full of absolute character,” the Palace manager said. “The way the game panned out, I think I’ve got to be very satisfied – to be honest it feels even like half a victory.”In the buildup Potter had described Hodgson as a “legend” in Sweden after cutting his managerial teeth in Scandinavia in the late 1970s and the similarities between the two men in the dugout provided a fascinating subplot to this always spicy encounter.The managers had shared a handshake and a joke as they emerged from the tunnel, with Potter, who spent eight years in charge of Östersund before returning home last year with Swansea, experiencing his first taste of an unusual enmity that dates back to the personal rivalry between former Tottenham teammates Alan Mullery and Terry Venables in the late 1970s.Hodgson handed a first league start since August to Christian Benteke, while Jaïro Riedewald was recalled to play at left-back in the absence of both Patrick van Aanholt and Jeffrey Schlupp – the first time the Dutchman has started a league match since February 2018. Brighton took the spoils in this fixture last season thanks to Anthony Knockaert’s late goal but with him and the former manager Chris Hughton now a distant memory on the south coast, this is a different side under Potter.The visitors dominated possession from kick-off, with Palace content to sit back and attempt to hit them on the break. Aaron Mooy was the closest to breaking the deadlock when his shot went just wide, before Riedewald was lucky to escape when he appeared to bring down Martín Montoya inside the area.Somewhat mysteriously, the VAR official, Martin Atkinson, decided the Palace defender had not made contact. Guaita did well to stop Lewis Dunk’s header from the resulting corner. “It looked like there was something there – sometimes you get them but sometimes you don’t,” Potter said, philosophically.Benteke’s only real contribution of the half was to pick up a booking after catching Dunk with his arm as they went up for a header. Riedewald, who Hodgson revealed had picked up an injury in training before the match, was put out of his misery at the break and James McArthur shifted to a makeshift left-back.Out of nowhere, Benteke almost shocked Mat Ryan into conceding when his cross sailed over the head of the Brighton goalkeeper and cannoned back off the woodwork.That would have been cruel on Potter’s side but his decision to swap Leandro Trossard to the right flank so he was up against McArthur paid idends shortly afterwards. The Belgian’s cross picked out Maupay on the penalty spot and he made no mistake via a deflection to give Brighton a deserved lead.It could have been even worse for Palace had Guaita not recovered after fumbling the ball at Maupay’s feet following a deep cross but the Spaniard somehow scrambled to deny him a second.Palace finally registered an effort on target in the 70th minute via a Benteke header easily gathered by Ryan, before the goalkeeper had to keep out the same player’s powerful effort at the near post.Suddenly the home supporters had something to shout about and soon Zaha bamboozled Montoya before firing the ball into the top corner with his left foot. The goal almost lifted the roof off this old stadium as Hodgson punched the air in delight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/999767041009f6b407f37971b598fe50aef8078e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f72ead8fddd175fddae1bb9b3b94b4e4","title":"how the guardian ranked the 100 best male footballers in the world 2019","story":"Dimitar Berbatov, Falcão and Daniele Massaro were part of our 239-strong voting panel as we compiled our list of the best male footballers on the planetFor our eighth male top 100 list we have assembled a voting panel of 239 judges from 63 countries, led by legendary players such as Dimitar Berbatov, Falcão and Daniele Massaro.They are backed up by a global selection of coaches, broadcasters, reporters, correspondents and editors, as well as other former players such as Javier Zanetti, Zico and Quinton Fortune.The 23 current and former professionals have won a combined total of 1,087 international caps.Our 239 judges are drawn from around the world as follows: Africa 21, Asia 15, Europe 146, North and Central America 16, South America 41.The countdown begins on Tuesday 17 December with Nos 100-71.

Here’s his take. Click and enjoy. Thanks for reading this MBM!And now a word with Brighton scorer Neal Maupay. “We should have won the game. We played better than them. We had chances, we put pressure on them, they were struggling. They scored a nice goal, though. But it’s a bit disappointing to just have one point tonight. I know it means a lot to the fans, and to me as well. I was happy to score but unfortunately it was not enough. We had possession, a lot of chances, a lot of movement. It is enjoyable to play like that.”Wilfried Zaha, Palace’s goalscoring hero, speaks to Sky. “Today’s obviously a big game, and I’m just glad we got back in it. If you can’t win it, don’t lose it. So I’m glad we managed to get a point at least. I was glad I managed to get the goal for the team, because we worked so hard. We’ve got a good run going, and I’m glad we can carry it on. We barely had the ball, props to them, they did their job. I felt like we deserved a point.”The draw means Palace pass up the chance to join Manchester United and Sheffield United on 25 points. They’re now ninth, with 23, one place above Arsenal. Brighton sit in 13th, on 20 points, one ahead of Bournemouth and West Ham United. They’ll head home, back down the M23, thinking they should have really won by a couple of goals, a result that would have taken them into the top half above the aforementioned Arsenal. But this is where we all are.There’s just enough time for Zaha to send an effort towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Ryan claims, and that’s that. The M23 derby ends all square, after a game not so much of two halves, but of seven and two ninths. Brighton were dominant for 70 minutes, Palace awful. But the hosts rallied in the latter stages, and tied it all up with a sensational goal. They’ll be the happier of the two sides, given the overall balance of play. But that’s derby football for you. 90 min +3: Tomkins is down with cramp. Palace have done a lot of defending this evening.90 min +2: Some space for Montoya on the right. He clips into the box. Maupay sends an overhead kick inches wide of the top left.90 min +1: From the corner, Tomkins sends a lame header off target. Bernardo comes on for Gross.90 min: Zaha tricks his way past Webster on the left and tees up Meyer, who looks to have been brought down by Burn to the left of the D. But there’s to be no free kick. There will, however, be three added minutes, and a corner for Palace in the first of them, the result of another Zaha probe.89 min: Mooy tries to release Gross down the left, but the pass is too weighty. Goal kick. A sense now that Brighton, in total command for so long, just want to hear the final whistle.87 min: Zaha sashays in from the left and sends a long pass across the pitch towards Kelly, who takes a touch and enters the box. It’s a rare old chance, but Kelly, who has never scored in the Premier League, suffers a nosebleed and lashes horribly high and wide.86 min: Propper is booked for a cynical nudge on Zaha, as the Palace goalscorer was looking to make off down the left.85 min: Mooy hovers over a shooting opportunity from the edge of the Palace box, but Meyer challenges him at the last. The tension at Selhurst is palpable.84 min: Brighton make a conservative double switch. Off go Trossard and Bissouma, on come Alzate and Duffy.83 min: Montoya skips down the right and is hauled over by Zaha. A free kick and an opportunity to swing one into the box. Gross takes. It’s a lovely delivery, and headed over by Dunk from the edge of the six-yard box. He was trying to guide the ball into the top left he should have got something on target.81 min: Ayew channels his inner Maradona and dribbles down the middle of the park, Brighton backtracking in a panic. He tries a curler towards the top right, but it’s always going over. Where on earth was this Crystal Palace for the first 70 minutes?79 min: Palace are up for this now. McCarthy goes over in the box, with Dunk at his back. The referee’s not interested in giving a penalty for that one, either, though again there looked to be contact.78 min: That’s woken Selhurst up. Brighton try to respond quickly, Maupay and Mooy combining down the right, briefly opening Palace up. Mooy crosses, but to nobody in particular.This had been coming, with Brighton suddenly sitting back. And they’ve been made to pay for their profligacy by Zaha, who drops a shoulder to cut in from the left, takes a touch back the other way, and whips an unstoppable effort into the top left! Brighton will wonder about this scoreline long and hard, given their dominance for most of the match. But here we are!74 min: Yep, they’ve finally risen from their slumber, an hour and ten minutes in to the match. Now Ayew races with purpose towards the Brighton box and slips a pass to Benteke on the edge of the area. Benteke can’t get a shot away. Zaha tries to keep things going, coming in from the left, then McCarthy tries an overhead kick from the middle of a muddle. Ryan claims.73 min: Hold on! Make that two. Benteke tussles with Dunk, spinning his man down the inside-right channel and slapping a shot towards the bottom right. That’s a highly decent effort, and one tipped round the post by Ryan. Nothing comes of the corner, but that’s so much better from Palace, who appear to have finally woken up.72 min: That was Palace’s first effort on target. Brighton have had ten.71 min: Palace hoick one hopefully into the Brighton mixer. Benteke wins a header well, but he’s too far out to seriously trouble Ryan, who claims easily.70 min: Mooy strides into a huge hole in the midfield. Palace look knackered. Mooy slips the ball wide left for Trossard, who takes a touch inside and fizzes a low shot towards goal. Guaita claims, eventually, after nearly spilling the ball at the feet of Montoya. It would have been a tap-in from a couple of yards.68 min: A Dann headed clearance is latched onto by Mooy, who very nearly releases Maupay into the box with a first-time pass. But the ball clips Maupay’s heel, and Palace escape. The hosts go up the other end, Zaha dribbling in from the left, only to have the ball taken from him by Montoya’s slide tackle. The resulting corner is a non-event, but that was much better from Palace, the new man Meyer injecting a bit of much-needed energy as he sent Zaha on his way.66 min: Milivojevic winds Propper with a good old-fashioned barge. While the Brighton midfielder catches his breath, Palace swap Kouyate for Meyer.64 min: Bissouma big-legs into a lot of space down the middle of the park. He whistles a daisycutter towards the bottom left from the best part of 30 yards. Guaita isn’t going to be beaten from there.63 min: Zaha curls a cross into the Brighton box from the left. Benteke competes but doesn’t get any purchase on his header. Brighton clear in the insouciant style. A little better from the hosts. Not much better, admittedly, but small acorns and all that.62 min: A short one this time, and Trossard drops a shoulder to skedaddle into the box along the byline. He can’t find a team-mate from a promising position, a sorry end to a clever run.61 min: Brighton’s corner isn’t all that, but Palace fail dismally to clear it anyway. Mooy and Gross combine down the left, the latter earning another corner. 60 min: Gross is clattered by Tomkins out on the left. A free kick, and a change for Brighton to load the box. Gross takes himself, and swings in a dangerous one into the mixer. Tomkins does pretty well to eyebrow out for a corner, with three Brighton players in attendance.58 min: Palace are giving the ball away with metronomic regularity. A half-arsed Dann clearance flies straight to Propper, whose attempt to release Mooy down the right is deflected out for a corner. From the set piece, Propper spins on the penalty spot and loops a strange effort towards the top left. It should be easy pickings for Guaita, but the keeper drops it onto the crossbar and into the six-yard box. Maupay is lurking, but can’t get a shot away and the keeper eventually smothers.56 min: A deserved lead for Brighton. Palace can have no complaints. It’s been all Brighton since the restart, just as it was in the first half, that strange Benteke cross-cum-shot apart.It’s fair to say this had been coming. Trossard is found in acres of space down the right by a glorious Bissouma crossfield pass. Trossard cushions a first-time pass inside for Maupay, who takes a touch on the penalty spot and lashes a shot into the top right. What a beautiful goal that was.53 min: Mooy bustles in from the left. He slips the ball wide right to Montoya, who is in acres, and should probably do better than clanging a cross off the nearest Palace player and out for a corner. The resulting set piece comes to nothing.51 min: So having said that, Palace come close to opening the scoring! Benteke strides down the right and hooks in a vicious cross that deceives Ryan and nearly nestles in the top left, slamming off the left-hand post instead and away from danger! Not sure whether he meant that or not. If he did, hats off. It would have been some way to end his Selhurst Park drought, one that stretches back to April 2018.49 min: Palace’s passing game is shot. Ayew clips a simple ball out of play under no pressure whatsoever. They’re still having trouble getting out of their own half.47 min: Montoya makes off down the right and crosses deep. Trossard pulls the ball back from the other side. Kouyate chests down and clears. Brighton want a penalty for handball, but they’re never getting it. Not sure why they went so vocal for that one, yet didn’t make a sound when Riedewald clipped Montoya in the first half. People are strange.Here we go again! Palace get the second half underway. They need to get their gamefaces on, and quick. Brighton enjoyed 68 percent possession in the first half. Palace haven’t had an attempt at goal yet. They’ve made one change: midfielder James McCarthy on for left back Jairo Riedewald. It looks as though James McArthur will stand in at left back.Half-time entertainment. Does the Fiver count as entertainment? Probably not. Here it is anyway.An easy claim for Guaita, and that’s your lot for the first half. Brighton have been dominant, and should have had a penalty, but they’ll be happy enough with an impressive performance that lacks only a cutting edge. Palace need a rethink. Over to you, Roy.45 min: Ping, ping, pass, pass, pass, ping, pass, pass, passity, pass. Eventually Trossard strides down the left and purchases a cheap corner off Kelly. A chance to load the box in the one minute that’ll be added to this half.43 min: Tomkins launches long down the right. Benteke’s not there. He can’t be bothered to make the run. That sums up Palace, who have been utterly bereft of attacking nous so far this evening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d846c839953434f273bb6597f80087586d8695/1452_1136_3091_1854/master/3091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d3ceecf2b8428ff932e4faba280cc55","title":"colum mccann broken violin refugee camp hopeful","story":"Music can be a form of resistance – but an unstrung violin didn’t hold much promise. Then it was fixed, a plume of dust rose, and the fiddler began to playIt wasn’t a long journey, really, from East Jerusalem to Bethlehem in the central West Bank, but it went across ancient borders and boundaries and checkpoints. We were on our way, a group of five from the non-profit global exchange group Narrative 4, to the Aida refugee camp in the shadow of what the Israelis call the “separation barrier” and the Palestinians call the “apartheid wall”. Among our group was Colm Mac Con Iomaire, an Irish fiddle player, one of the finest musicians in the world.We abandoned the taxi at Checkpoint 300 and left Colm’s fiddle in the car, knowing that we were quicker on foot, but that the taxi would bring the fiddle along later: everywhere we went in Israel and Palestine, Colm would open up the eyelids of the day by playing a tune.We were met by Dr Abdelfattah Abusrour, founder of Alrowwad, a community-based organisation for the arts in the heart of the camp. We were there to talk about a possible collaboration between the young people in his camp and schools all over the world: Limerick, Birmingham, Chicago, Newtown, Port Elizabeth, Tampico.“We left our music in the taxi,” Colm apologised.“Oh, you’re a fiddle player,” said Abdelfattah, off-handedly, pointing to a corner where a small pile of rubber bullets, gas cannisters and “sound bomb” shells also sat. “We were just given a fiddle by a lady in England, but it’s broken and nobody knows how to fix it.” And in the cramped office space, Abdelfattah began to talk of his concepts of beautiful resistance, using stories and music and dance and theatre to allow young people and women in the camp to become changemakers.Colm rose noiselessly from his chair and reached for the modern-looking case. The violin looked like something long ago sound-bombed. The strings were twisted. The bridge was hanging off.Upon the possibility of hope one always tastes the possibility of sorrow: the violin looked like my cliched concept of a refugee, silent, unstrung.Colm began to work with the strings. “Art puts us on an equal ground,” said Abdelfattah. Colm turned the bridge around. “We shape a better future despite everything we come up against,” said Abdelfattah. Colm loosened and tightened the pegs, adjusted the chin rest. “We do not want your sympathy,” said Abdelfattah. Colm made the strings taut: the violin began to look half-musical. “Seventy per cent of those who go through the Alrowwad programme don’t go to prison,” said Abdelfattah. Colm positioned the tail-piece. “People think these kids know only how to throw stones,” said Abdelfattah, “but we write, we sing, we dance, too.”The violin looked half sober. Colm worked his fingers around the peg box, plucked the strings, tightened and untightened the pegs, tuning from low to high. There were two bows in the case. One was brand new, unrosined. The second was older. Colm took a hold of the second one. The room waited. We had no idea if it would make any sound.This is the music of what happens: a plume of dust rose from the violin. It seemed to me a moment so theatrical it could only be true. Later, I learned that it was rosin dust rising from the bow hairs, but at the time it seemed that the thing was emerging from another age.Colm played Róisín Dubh, an Irish love tune from the 17th century. No singing, no words. The sound of the violin made a brand new lung of the room. He followed it with an improvised fusion piece involving the call to prayer, a dance tune we had learned in Nablus, and rap rhythms heard in Israel. It was some of the most glorious music I have ever heard.And then Abdelfattah – who had visited Belfast – asked if he knew the song Only Our Rivers Run Free. Again, no singing, but the words were there: “Where are you now when we need you?”The morning pressed up against us. We had to leave. But our stories never necessarily end. Colm found a tag in the case – from a shop in Bristol, England. He figured the violin was probably late 19th-century, maybe early 20th. An unopened envelope from the donor read: “To the New Owner of this Violin.”The letter remained unopened. The fiddle would now be passed to a young person in the camp.We found our taxi. Colm’s original fiddle was sitting on the back seat. It, too, was an ancient piece: it sat there, speaking to us.• Apeirogon by Colum McCann is published by Bloomsbury on 25 February (£18.99).

Images that give hope for 2020 – selected by Sarah GilbertI had been photographing a press conference at the Swedish parliament in November last year. The wind was cold as I came out and there were dark clouds in the sky, but despite this a dozen people, adults and children, had gathered to demonstrate outside, Greta Thunberg among them. We talked a little about what she thought about the future, I took some pictures, and walked away. When I looked back at her a few seconds later, she was being interviewed by another journalist. I remember thinking, “This is the beginning of something big.”Greta’s message is extremely important. She wants to take care of the Earth and the resources that are left to us. I am very proud of my own efforts in spreading her message – my picture has been in an exhibition in Canada, on a book cover, made into postcards, stickers and published all over the world. Girl power. As told to Imogen TildenWith only about 5,500 black rhinos left in the world, each one is so precious that conservationists, such as those at Lewa wildlife conservancy, have to work hard to ensure their survival. Since the conservancy’s founding in 1983, Lewa’s rhino population has grown from 15 to 169. Yet if poaching continues at its current level, rhinos and elephants will be functionally extinct in our lifetimes.We often forget, however, that the best protectors of landscapes are local communities – who often live on the frontlines of poaching wars. These Samburu warriors had never seen a rhino before some had never even seen a photo of one. They had visited Lewa to learn about conservation.Without rhinos, elephants and other wildlife we suffer more than loss of ecosystem health. We suffer a loss of imagination, a loss of wonder, a loss of beautiful possibilities. When we see ourselves as part of nature, we understand that saving nature is really about saving ourselves. As told to Imogen TildenSandy is 22 and lives in the heart of gang territory in East Los Angeles. There’s a bullet hole in her front window, and there are helicopters so often overhead they call them ghetto birds. At the time of this photo, October 2017, her brother Edgar was in jail, and her other brother, Marco, had been killed in gang violence the previous year.Kids are introduced to a gang lifestyle from a very young age, but Sandy refused to be sucked in by the cycle of drugs and violence. She graduated from high school and at the time was studying in college alongside volunteering at a local boxing club and helping to raise Edgar’s kids. She’s a miracle! Such a positive force, a symbol of hope.She and her family visit Marco’s grave every Sunday that’s her mum and her niece also in the picture. The whole family hang out there for an hour or two each week, they picnic, the kids play and they remember the good times they had with Marco. As told to Imogen TildenIt was early morning, maybe 6am. I was in Lesbos, the Greek island that marks the end of many refugees’ journeys to Europe. But it also marks the beginning of a whole new journey and set of difficulties.The boats usually arrived under the cover of darkness. During the days you could see them slowly approaching, and we would track their progress and try to calculate where they would come in.The minute the boats landed, most passengers would set off up the beach towards the reception centre, but some would pause briefly to unpack their cellphones or dry off a little, and that would give me a chance to talk to them. These men had started this leg of their voyage in Turkey, but they were mostly from Afghanistan originally.I have covered refugee crises all over the world for the past decade and I continue to be struck by the desperation that drives people to leave everything they own and set out into the unknown on extremely dangerous journeys. When crowded and barely seaworthy boats actually make it to Europe, like this one had, you see such joy and hope on their faces.For one brief moment, these young men knew that they had taken charge of their lives and they felt empowered, and hopeful that they had a future. As told to Imogen TildenI was doing a story on HIV and Aids in Bangladesh when I met Hazera Beagum. This was 1996, when she was a sex worker. We became friends. Later, around 2008, I found out that she had set up this orphanage on the edge of Dhaka for children like her.It’s a very special place. She doesn’t take a salary. I asked how she survives and she said: “We share the food that we have and there is a roof over our heads. Thirty-five kids call me mum … what more can I ask for?”I spent one night with them. The kids were all singing and dancing. I was sitting down talking to one of the other kids when I saw this girl doing the twirl … I didn’t have the time to get my camera, but luckily I had a little Panasonic with me so I was able to record the moment.Hazera is a very loving mother, but she’s also strict – she makes sure the kids do their homework, pray and clean up. They all adore her. And they have ambition – the girl in the photo wants to be a model when she grows up.Hazera has had a very, very difficult life – she was abused, gang-raped and forced into pickpocketing and later, prostitution. But rather than be bitter about it, she has turned her life around to create dreams for other people. As told to Tim JonzeThe picture was taken in Yaoundé, the political capital of Cameroon. Cameroon shelters around 400,000 refugees, the vast majority from Nigeria and the Central African Republic.I spent six months last year following two families who had fled from war in CAR more than a decade ago. They had chosen to live in the city in the hope that they would have a better chance of making a new life, but the reality is that refugees often find themselves exploited, vulnerable and paid far less than the legal wage. Merveille is eight and she’s throwing a ball in her family’s tiny backyard where she and her brothers play and where the family wash clothes, cook, and throw their garbage.Her father had an accident at work and because he was unable to afford medical care he is now disabled and can only sit at home on the couch. Her mother works for less than $1 a day in a restaurant. I asked Merveille about her dreams. She told me she dreamed her mum would stop worrying, and that her father could go out of the house.She wants to become a school teacher. During the months I spent with the family, no matter how difficult things were, the children were always playing and laughing. As long as kids can be kids there’s hope. These children are our future and we must trust in them and give them the opportunities they deserve.This picture wants to show that there are hopes, dreams and poetry under the corrugated iron. As told to Imogen TildenI was staying at the hotel and asked if I could photograph the balcony gardens. I went up to the roof for a more complete view: to get this shot I had to lean out over the edge, holding a fire escape ladder. The morning rush hour was just beginning and the traffic was starting to build. Below me, a swimmer was doing laps in the balcony pool, and there was one exact moment when she was positioned in the middle so I could see the whole form of her body, and the colours of cars on the street and that of the plants matched up perfectly.Green spaces improve both air quality and happiness. Plants absorb heat and make buildings cooler. Flooding risks during heavy rains are lowered, because soil absorbs water. They also allow other species to reside or migrate safely. Most countries have not yet made the reforms needed to curb climate change. But there are examples of green buildings all across the world, and schemes such as Singapore’s can make a difference. Hope is the fuel we need to fix the world. As told to Imogen TildenWe went out to a field near her house full of buttercups. She was almost totally unaware of the fact she was being photographed, not self-conscious at all. That’s what’s hopeful to me about the image. I felt confident she would find other ways to achieve her life goals, even if the Catholic church won’t have her. As told to Tim JonzeI spent time in Mosul in early 2018, six months after the battle to retake it from Islamic State. The theme park on the banks of the river Tigris had been completely destroyed by heavy fighting. But only a matter of months later it was up and running again and families and young couples were visiting.I remember the booming Iraqi pop music blaring out of the loudspeakers on this ride, the Crazy Dance, and finding it very poignant, especially to see women there, smiling, wearing colourful headscarves. Under Isis, women had been largely kept inside, but now they were able to move freely around the city again, attend the university, enjoy leisure time.There’s a risk that when a part of the world is only seen through images of conflict and destruction people can get compassion fatigue. The way the news cycle works makes it difficult to stick around after the guns have fallen silent, but it’s so important to also see the aftermath of these terrible situations and seek out the more hopeful stories about returning to life.You can’t whitewash over what’s happened – you are in the midst of people looking for or mourning their loved ones, but you need to find balance and show images people can relate to. These stories and pictures can be a form of catharsis for the people you’re portraying and the viewer as well.

In addition, the introduction of Black Friday in recent years means consumers have also come to expect an increasing amount of pre-Christmas discounting. The result is a blending of promotions, one seeping into the next, and a steady price decline rather than a steep Boxing Day drop.“With one shopping weekend left before Christmas, this week could see a tipping point in promotions.”High street trading has not only been hit by uncertainty around Brexit and the general election but also by the consumer switch to online spending. As more retailers offer quick delivery services, shoppers have become increasingly willing to buy online much closer to Christmas.Gordon said online shopping would continue to affect retail trends over the festive period.“We anticipate many Boxing Day discounts to go live online on Christmas Day itself, those browsing perhaps buying the one present they didn’t receive. On the physical high street, though, Boxing Day promotions could arrive even earlier. The operational challenges that sales present in-store mean some retailers could be offering Boxing Day sale prices on Christmas Eve, for those willing to hit the shops early.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48d0654d21e68943cd395762a5aa0c750d3a9290/0_0_4419_2651/master/4419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=312711bff470011893ad407cef685d87","title":"qa how the bbc is funded by tv licences","story":"The future of the broadcaster is in the spotlight after Boris Johnson’s election victory The licence fee as a method of funding the BBC dates back to 1923, when it was charged on the owners of radio sets. The standard TV licence now costs £154.50 a year and pays for the BBC’s TV, radio and online operations. Some of it helps fund the Welsh channel S4C, and in recent years the Conservatives have also loaded the costs of both funding the World Service (previously subsidised by the Foreign Office) and providing over-75s with free licencess (previously paid by the Department for Work and Pensions) on to the corporation.There are 25,752,560 television licences in the UK, according to the most recent figures – a slight drop on the previous year, despite the population continuing to increase.According to TV Licensing, the revenue collection process begins by writing to homes listed as not having a licence. “If no response is received from an address, the tone of the letters progressively becomes stronger to encourage a reply. Sometimes a stronger message is required for people to comply with their legal obligation. The address will also be listed for a visit from an enquiry officer to enquire about the licensing requirements.”Officers do not have a legal right of entry to a person’s home without a search warrant from a court, but they may ask to be let in, at which point they check whether there is a television in the main living space.The maximum penalty for not having a TV licence is a £1,000 fine. There is no jail term attached to the offence, but a person may be imprisoned by the court for failing to pay the court fine.“TV Licensing will only prosecute when all other options have been exhausted,” said Suzy Vickers, of TV Licensing, last year. “The majority of first-time offenders will be able to avoid prosecution if they buy a licence before their case comes to court.”Despite this, 129,446 people were prosecuted for non-payment last year, and the vast majority were found guilty. Although most were dealt with swiftly and did not take up a substantial amount of court time, it still amounts to more than a tenth of all cases brought before magistrates courts. When the  reported on such hearings back in 2014, one man attempted to hand over his television to the court to avoid prosecution.Non-payment of the licence fee disproportionately affects women, with three-quarters of those prosecuted being female, perhaps because they are more likely to be at home during the day when officers visit.The BBC’s existence is underpinned by a royal charter, the most recent of which was signed for 10 years in 2017. This guarantees the existence of the licence fee until 2027, and it would require new legislation to unpick this arrangement, which could be difficult and would face substantial opposition in the House of Lords.However, the level at which the licence fee is set – and therefore the amount of funding available to the BBC – is up for negotiation. The current arrangement runs out in 2022, at which point there needs to be a new agreement between the government and the BBC for the next five-year period.The government has said it is actively considering decriminalisation of the licence fee, an idea last floated five years ago when Sajid Javid was culture secretary. This approach would downgrade non-payment to a civil offence, with enforcement made by TV Licensing through civil courts and enforced using bailiffs – similar to non-payment of an electricity bill.In 2015 the government-commissioned Perry review unexpectedly concluded that the current system should be maintained, with decriminalisation risking around £200m of BBC revenue. The review concluded that maintaining non-payment as a criminal offence was “broadly fair and proportionate response to the problem of licence fee evasion and provides good value for money” while the funding system remained intact.In the long run, other European countries are shifting away from licence fees and towards funding public broadcasters through general taxation. This would leave BBC funding even more at the whim of the government of the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81f607548d3d2b5d307d402a773c785c398adfd/15_199_4234_2540/master/4234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c3adffc92a7aee8cdd107e80222d278","title":"investors could face cash restrictions on woodford style funds","story":"Bank of England looks at rules after gating or UK property fund and Neil Woodford saga Investors could be blocked from pulling out their cash at short notice unless they are willing to take a hit on the value of their investment, the Bank of England has warned.Proposals put forward by City regulators will put the investment sector back in the spotlight after the gating of one of the UK’s largest property funds this month and the high-profile collapse of Neil Woodford’s investment empire.The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority are considering new rules for the industry after an initial review found problems in the way funds measure and communicate their liquidity – or how easy it is to sell and redistribute funds to investors.Woodford’s flagship fund was initially suspended in June because of a surge in redemptions that he could not not keep up with as investors rushed to pull out their money after a series of poor market bets. Among the problems Woodford faced was the proportion of unlisted assets in his Equity Income Fund, which was meant to have a very small amount of illiquid holdings.It meant Woodford could not sell the assets quick enough to meet redemption requests, resulting in the suspension and eventual wind-down of the fund.The Bank of England governor said the rules were meant to address the “mismatch” between redemption terms and liquidity. He said the current system had a “first-mover advantage” where customers have a better chance of getting their cash back in full if they pull their money first. That incentive could cause a run on funds.“This has the potential of becoming a systemic risk, as first-mover advantage could cause a destabilising rush towards the exit,” Mark Carney said.While liquidity usually measures how much of the fund is invested in listed assets such as stocks, the regulators said liquidity should actually measure the amount of cash that they could realistically get back during a quick sale.Alternatively, asset managers would have to stop offering daily redemptions – meaning investors would have to give longer notice periods if they wanted to pull their cash, unless they were willing to accept steep discounts on the value of their funds.The FCA said the review’s full findings, to be released next year, would help it formulate new rules for open-ended funds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/770c7a7f37ac41b5a1039d0100c8ffe67dd80df0/0_137_3009_1805/master/3009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503bd6e4a7667f4a30cca849e35f7d7e","title":"jarvis cocker running the world single christmas no1 spot","story":"In light of the Conservative election victory, fans have started a campaign to get the explicit song to the festive No 1 spotA campaign to get Jarvis Cocker’s 2006 single Running the World to the Christmas No 1 spot in light of the Conservative election victory has started with aplomb.“In light of so much recent election horror, let’s do this, eh?” wrote instigator Darcie Shoenman Molina on Facebook. “Bit of fun to focus on for the next week.”The song, now a staple of Cocker’s live sets, is a satire of upper-class behaviours that features the chorus: “If you thought things had changed, friend, you’d better think again  Bluntly put, in the fewest of words, cunts are still running the world.”Representatives for Cocker told the  that he was unavailable for comment.In 2011, Cocker told the Observer that he would have loved the track “to have been an international No 1, but radio play was quite difficult for that one”.While he looks unlikely to beat LadBaby’s I Love Sausage Rolls to the Christmas No 1 spot, he may come close to realising his dream: at the time of writing, iTunes UK ranks the song at No 3 on its streaming and download charts. It is No 2 on Amazon Music and No 1 on 7digital.A selection of songs that make the charts are played in full as part of the BBC’s UK Top 40 rundown on Friday afternoons. A BBC spokesperson told the  that they could not comment on whether this song will be played prior to the confirmation of this week’s chart placings.The spokesperson said: “The Official Chart Show and the Christmas No 1 are historical and factual accounts of what the British public have been listening to, and we make decisions about which songs are played when the final chart positions are clear.”A similar politically motivated campaign pushed a recording of Ding, Dong! The Witch Is Dead from the Wizard of Oz to the No 2 spot in the wake of Margaret Thatcher’s death in 2013. Radio 1 censored the song in that week’s chart rundown, a decision station controller Ben Cooper said was a “difficult compromise” regarding the balance of respect for a person who had died with issues around freedom of speech.In September, Cocker said that Running the World “feels even more relevant now”. He told the : “A strangely common aspect of people that get in power at the moment is that they’re these weird characters – ridiculous people in a way – but people seem to find entertainment in that. And that’s dangerous really. Politics has turned into Game of Thrones and they like all the skulduggery and stabbing people in the back. I can’t see it ending well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7679c932ee4d1c93b3633b4b97422fff893d117/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb25ef66ab724e8a25b203c1e1430f","title":"election 2019 john crace on the lowlights and the gaffes","story":"’s political sketch writer, John Crace, runs through the highs and the many, many lows of the 2019 general election campaign.

Boris Johnson had barely stumbled out of bed, and Dominic Cummings even had time to turn his T-shirt inside out and undo his laces before the snapper arrived to photograph their artfully casual breakfast meeting shortly after 8am.The only sense of urgency was coming from Dilyn the Downing Street dog, who was scratching at the door, desperate to be let out. Then again, he had been dying to escape ever since he had made the mistake of catching Carrie’s eye at the dogs’ home. How dumb was that! Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine. Don’t play it again, Dilyn.This was the new normal for the People’s Government. A morning frenzy of inactivity. Before the election, Downing Street had been on high alert from six o’clock onwards every morning, with everyone listening to the Radio 4 Today programme dreading the moment a minister said something idiotic or was unable to answer a single question. But now that Classic Dom had banned anyone in government from appearing on a BBC programme so obviously biased that even Labour was questioning its impartiality, everyone could chill a bit.Just as Dom and Boris were settling down to eat a light breakfast of Shreddies and crushed valium with a Uri Geller spoon, as they tried to brainstorm ideas that might play well in northern towns they had never known existed before the previous Thursday, a panic-stricken aide burst into the kitchen. “It’s a disaster,” she garbled. “David Davis has somehow found his way on to the Today programme.”“How the hell did that happen?” Dom growled. “He is literally one of the dimmest members of the Tory party. And that’s really saying something.”“I’m not sure,” said the aide. “I guess he imagined the blanket omertà didn’t apply to ex-ministers.”“Shit, shit, shit. How can we be a one-nation party if we don’t all talk with one voice? Mine. Anyway, how bad is it?”“Pretty bad,” the aide admitted. “He’s already said that Boris believes in something ...”“No. But from now on, you’ll believe in whatever I tell you to,” Dom said, walking across the room to turn up the radio. “Now shut the fuck up as we listen to the rest of this.”Everyone fell silent as Davis explained his vision for the coming year. Of course there would be ergence with the EU. A great deal in some areas, not so much in others. And there would be very bumpy times ahead. But it was his considered opinion that the EU would eventually cave in, just as it had by offering Boris the same deal that he and Theresa May had rejected 18 months earlier, and that even if it didn’t then WTO rules would be no big deal as the whole country would be worse off under either scenario.People were just going to have to learn to accept that they would inevitably be let down by the new government. There were so many different new factions in the new Tory party – the old home counties heartlands and the former Labour voters in the north – that it would be impossible to keep everyone happy. So the simplest and fairest way forward was to let everyone down. Davis wasn’t called the master military tactician for nothing. Or at all.Dom picked up the radio and hurled it on to the floor. Fragments of metal and plastic sprayed across the room. Dilyn shrugged. He’d seen this all before. There were now four of them in this marriage. “Why does that idiot think I spent months coaching you to say nothing but ‘Get Brexit Done’?” Dom yelled. Boris kept his head down, avoiding eye contact. He knew better than to interrupt Dom when he was going off on one.“The whole point was to make everyone think Brexit was a done deal,” Dom continued. “Now that moron Davis has given the game away that Brexit has barely begun. Jesus wept! We were meant to have until at least the new year before people realised we were going to disappoint them. Happy sodding Christmas to you too, Dave.”The atmosphere was toxic inside No 10 for much of the rest of the day as Dom tried to work out how best to silence the BBC. What better way for a one-nation party to unite the country than to stop its most respected broadcaster from asking awkward questions of the People’s Government? All it needed was someone both gullible and biddable to oversee the hatchet job on the Beeb. Someone to replace Nicky Morgan.Dom undid his trousers and kicked the furniture as he wracked his brains for the right person. But there was no one better than Morgan. She had been the only woman during the election campaign who could be relied on to be sent on media rounds to explain how 31,000 nurses were really 50,000. Mainly because her maths was that bad. But she had already stood down as an MP. So he’d just stick two fingers up to the entire country, appoint her to the Lords and keep her in the cabinet. Brilliant. The People’s Government partly run from the unelected Lords.

In a 60 Minutes episode from 9 December, Church confirmed that the app would screen out potential partners who are considered to have the “wrong” DNA.Church, a molecular engineer, has dismissed claims the app would create a distinction between acceptable and unacceptable humans. In an interview with the Daily Beast on Saturday, he said: “It is ludicrous to think that’s what I’m doing, but it makes good click bait, doesn’t it?”The app, which has not yet been developed, would in theory prevent two people from matching if they had similar genetic mutations that could result in rare, hereditary diseases like Tay-Sachs. The service would probably be on offer to premium subscribers. Church said that his idea offers users choice, whereas eugenics is “coercive”. He said: “Rather than restricting people’s options for their health and their families, we’re expanding them.”Critics have said that the idea amounts to casually discussing eugenics. But Church disagrees: “We are not going to be forcibly sterilising people, if that’s the business model they think we’re up to. That’s as far from what we intend to do as can be.”When asked whether his app would encourage more stigma against disabled and chronically sick people, trans people or certain races, Church emphasised that the app would only restrict matches that would result in “illnesses that cause very premature deaths, often with pain and a lot of medical costs”.Church also spoke about photos of him with Epstein on his private beach in the Caribbean in 2007, at a property later nicknamed “paedophile island” because of alleged sexual abuse that went on there. “We just came there for a meeting and then came back. We looked around the beach a bit. There wasn’t much there, frankly,” he said.Church put an FAQ on his website on Wednesday for anyone with questions about the proposed app. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d16fa3bcb9803e05b7784f9510ce5df772999b4/524_807_4402_2641/master/4402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9e877d5901b6766e72b5a33f8c16d87","title":"female scientists use less positive language about their work study finds","story":"Tendency of men to use words such as ‘excellent’ has effect on future citations of researchMale scientists are more likely than female ones to publish work that describes itself as “excellent”, “unique” or “novel”, experts have found – a swagger that appears to reap idends in respect of how often others reference the research.The team say this matters as citations have an impact on salary, whether a researcher secures grants and whether they receive promotions – areas where there is a well-known gender gap in favour of men.“A paper that is cited more often is going to be viewed by a promotions committee within a university as being more important than an article that is cited less often,” said Prof Anupam Jena, a co-author of the research from Harvard Medical School.Writing in the BMJ, Jena and colleagues report that they analysed the titles and abstracts of 101,720 articles in the field of clinical research – such as drug trials or health studies – published between 2002 and 2017. The gender of the first and last author was determined using a name-based algorithm.The team then searched these for 25 positive words, such as “robust”, “novel”, “remarkable” and “promising”.The analysis took into account factors that could have affected the findings, such as the journal, field of research and year of publication. Further analysis revealed that the finding was driven by differences in language among papers published in the most prestigious journals. The same trend was seen when the team looked at more than 6m papers in the life science field.For both fields, the team found positive words were associated with a higher rate of subsequent citations.Jena said there are probably many other examples of self-promotion that may differ between men and women, affecting careers. “This is just one lens into that phenomenon,” he said. In a linked editorial, Prof Reshma Jagsi from the University of Michigan and Dr Julie Silver of Harvard Medical School called on journals to tackle bias, saying the system should be changed rather than expecting women to simply boast more. One suggestion is a set of standards on the use of positive terms.They also call for research looking at whether positive terms are more likely to be removed in the editing process from studies by women. Heavy copyediting, they note, is more common in high-impact journals, where the new findings were most striking.Helen Wollaston, the chief executive of Wise, a campaign for women in science and engineering, welcomed the study. “It just shows the power of language – these subtle things that can make a big impact,” she said, adding that training of scientists in the power of language whatever their gender could be important. She said editors should be aware of subtle gender differences in how scientists described their work.Prof Athene Donald, of the University of Cambridge, said there was a growing body of research showing editorial processes could be biased when it comes to gender. “Here is another example when gender differences, probably imposed by unconscious cultural norms on both authors and editors, lead to ergent outcomes,” she said. “Because publishing itself has so much impact on career progression, this finding has significant implications. Academic processes and institutions need to pay much more attention to what gets published where, why and by whom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbff2376710ebc907cdb3573b0cbb19325f92dbd/0_0_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6508b12a8e49398b65bd53481c482518","title":"bernie ecclestone tamara jewellery raid possibly an inside job","story":"Former F1 boss says burglary at daughter Tamara’s house was an ‘awful thing to happen’The former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has said he believes the theft of £50m worth of jewellery from his daughter’s property was an “inside job”.Tamara Ecclestone was said to have been left “shaken” by the burglary at her London home on Friday night which happened after she left the country for her Christmas holidays.Scotland Yard investigators say they are keeping an open mind about the raid on the house near Hyde Park.However, Bernie Ecclestone, 89, said on Monday: “I don’t have all the facts but given all the security at the house, I’m assuming it was an inside job.“It’s an awful thing to happen just after she had left the house to go to Lapland. Although maybe it’s better that she wasn’t in at the time.”Tamara Ecclestone – who posted an image on her Instagram account last week of a child at the steps of what appeared to be a private jet, followed by another a day later seemingly from an overseas destination – posted a biblical verse on Monday in what some followers interpreted as a reference to the theft.“For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open,” read the lines from Luke 8:17.Her husband, the former city trader Jay Rutland, posted an image on Instagram with the words: “I know u are lying but continue.”Thieves are believed to have entered through the garden before breaking into safes hidden in the bedroom of the house in central London.All of Ecclestone’s jewellery is understood to have been taken. Police used sniffer dogs to search the grounds of the property, and are looking through CCTV.The Sun reported that intruders fled with items including rings, earrings and an £80,000 Cartier bangle given to her as a wedding present.A spokesman for Tamara Ecclestone said: “I can sadly confirm there has been a home invasion. Internal security are co-operating with police in this matter.“Tamara and family are well but obviously angry and shaken by the incident.The politan police said officers were called to a residential property in Palace Green at 11.11pm on Friday to reports of a burglary and that a “fast-paced investigation” was underway.DS Matthew Pountney, from Central West command unit, said: “A number of officers, including the dog unit, deployed to the residential property, in Palace Green, W8. However, the suspects had already left the scene when the call to police was made.”“At this time we are investigating this as an isolated burglary and we are retaining an open mind around other lines of enquiry.“Police were called by security within the building to three males who had been present inside the property and a fast-paced investigation is underway to locate the suspects and missing items.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4a956bec801b95920248ffbbf6f87ee5257182/0_109_5507_3305/master/5507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc71d339b5fffd47ccec0053ffee443a","title":"champions cup revamp 18 teams two legged semi finals","story":"Changes to the structure of the Champions Cup are being considered with some stakeholders keen to reduce the competition to 18 teams. Organisers are pushing for a final decision within weeks as they look to guarantee the future of the tournament beyond 2022 when existing commercial and broadcasting contracts expire.Europe’s flagship club tournament involves 20 teams in five pools of four but it is understood discussions are continuing about the possibility of switching to six pools of three, featuring the top six sides from the Premiership, Pro 14 and Top 14.This could free up sufficient space in the packed calendar for money-spinning home and away semi-finals, as has long been the case in football’s Champions League.This format has yet to be agreed but the idea is believed to be attracting more support than a rival proposal to cut the field to 16 teams. One of the attractions of an 18-team competition would be to prevent teams from the same country from meeting each other in the pool stages, as has been the case again this year.With European Professional Club Rugby looking to put in place a range of commercial and broadcasting deals beyond 2022, Premiership Rugby’s new relationship with the private equity firm CVC has also led to some speculation about the potential implications for the supposed jewel in Europe’s club crown, particularly given only three teams – Leinster, Toulon and Saracens – have won the trophy since 2010.The EPCR’s director general, Vincent Gaillard, confirmed his organisation has not yet been approached by CVC and has called on stakeholders to underline their commitment to Europe early in the new year.“We need to have some certainty for the direction of the tournament,” he said. “We have received a very clear mandate from the board for the process to be concluded shortly. We are discussing whether there might be potential for change or improvement but if the desire is to stay with a 20-team Champions Cup that’s what we’ll do. We’re not in a bad place, we just need to project ourselves into the future.”With CVC also considering investing in the Top 14 and the Six Nations, however, Gaillard accepts there is an increasing need for clarity in a fast-changing sporting landscape. “Will others come up with plans of their own? Possibly but I just don’t see weakening Europe as a desirable scenario for anyone, not even CVC. From a sporting and commercial standpoint it is a very profitable venture for everyone.“The most important thing for me is that the financial world should not negatively affect player welfare or sporting calendars. We’re keeping a watchful eye but there is nothing so far that suggests that will be the case.”EPCR is also optimistic Brexit will not undermine sporting cross-border relationships. “On the basic logistical level there is no immediate concern because a transition period will be involved,”Gaillard said. “On a political level does it change anything? I don’t think it does. I think Britain is part of the future of European rugby. I can hardly see, say, England disappearing from the rugby map any time soon. I think European rugby is part of their future and vice versa, no matter what the politics around it might be.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0369d6cf769393566aeb815a662fd68b895deeed/0_207_2408_1444/master/2408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961555dfb98d8c52f0419a06f02a365c","title":"freeman tribunal adjourned may not finish october 2020","story":"The occasionally dramatic if sprawling medical tribunal of the former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman, which was due to be done and dusted last March, may not finish now until October 2020 after being adjourned yet again.Dr Freeman, who faces being struck off after accepting 18 of 22 charges against him, including ordering 30 sachets of banned testosterone and lying about it to UK Anti-Doping, had been due to testify this week but had to pull out on Monday on grounds of ill health.That has led to the case at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, which had already been rescheduled from February 2019 after Freeman suffered stress issues, being pushed back probably until late April or May 2020 as both legal teams have other business to attend in the new year.However the tribunal heard that if the case is not settled in a four-week window in the spring it may need to be adjourned again until October. The MPTS said it would confirm the timings at 10.30am on Tuesday.Freeman has denied ordering testosterone to be sent to British Cycling headquarters in 2011 knowing or believing it was intended to enhance an athlete’s performance.He maintains that he was bullied into ordering it to treat the erectile dysfunction of the former British Cycling performance director, Shane Sutton, a claim Sutton denies.As Sutton told the tribunal last month: “I would have no problem in telling you it was for me. You are telling the press I can’t get a hard on – my wife wants to testify that you are a bloody liar.”Last week Freeman’s QC Mary O’Rourke said her client, who has bipolar disorder, had seen his psychiatrist after a “crisis”, adding: “I’m not going to take risks or play games with his health.”Freeman has attended the hearing for only one day since Sutton called him “a spineless inidual” before storming out.O’Rourke then tried unsuccessfully to have Sutton’s evidence struck from the record.

I was immediately entranced. Like many middle-aged women I still held childhood dreams of running away to the circus and Nell was someone who actually had. I had to meet her.I asked her, husband Toti, and the entire troupe for tea, then we began a conversation of like minds and indeed like imaginations that really only finished this last week. The conversation has been about 14 years long.At that first meeting we realised we had a crucial thing in common: both our parents had suffered brain injury. Nell’s mother at 52 had fallen off a horse with horrific consequences and my father at 50 had suffered a post-operative stroke that had rendered him half paralysed and unable to see. Nell and I were both in our teens at the time.Our reactions were somewhat similar – Nell ran away to the circus. I phoned up an agent and became an actor. I think we were both fired by a stubbornness to remain undaunted by random catastrophe and a need to author our own reality. If nightmares could come true, so could dreams.Giffords Circus has been, for 14 years, a beacon in my year. A sort of summer Christmas. Particularly the bit at the end when the troupe invite the audience into the ring to dance. I always try to bottle that feeling to last me for the year.In between the summer shows life continued. She had much longed for babies. I remember my daughter Nell (semi named after Nell) bathing Nell’s twins, Red and Cecil, in tin baths on the lawns outside the caravans (me marvelling how could Nell have twins and run a circus). She wasn’t normal, I concluded.And rather like our lives had started, in some ways we continued on similar parallel paths. We both had devastating-to-the-heart orces, had summit meetings on how best to navigate with grace and discussed the complicated practicalities. How to stage-manage life – inside the ring and out.We both had depressions, and treacherous passages of orce grief and we talked from our separate beds – hers in Gloucestershire and mine in London – about how to take the next step in the dark. In short we held hands when stumbling. We developed our own “how to survive life” shorthand, such as “horizontal it”, ie when you can, go to bed.When she became ill, Nell installed a day-bed behind the circus where I gave instructions for her to remain. I joined her whenever I visited.We had dreams. Main plan: I was going to join the circus for a season (forgetting my children).Almost happened plan: my brother and I were going to take over the circus for a surprise birthday present for my mum. Nell designed a moon I could sit on while singing a song on the ukulele and a trapeze act in which I hung off it in a tomato onesie. Possibly upside down.The thing is, though, that with Nell dreams actually came true. I have no doubt that had she been given a bit more time we would have done both of the above.And then she became ill. It was so long ago now, we should really have got used to the fact that she would die but for those who had the luck to know her she really was a superwoman. She wasn’t made to end. She was extraordinary. No one did chemotherapy like she did. I know no one else who would be flat out on her bed one moment and then on a horse in front of an audience the next, all smiling and in hopeful bridal white.In the last few weeks of her life she went to Cuba – with her children, her own strongman Pozo and beautiful Nancy – scuba ed, then went to Switzerland looking for horses to buy. She was an engine of creativity – painting, writing, Instagramming a cancer diary, being a mum and running the circus.Never was there another who lived so vividly. What I loved and found rare about Nell and why she’s a true heroine is that she never avoided, or minimised pain.She was a true warrior, a poet, a magician. Like Frida Kahlo she took her pain and out of that messy crucible forged art and wonder – she went to battle daily. I always thought she’d look good in a suit of armour!I didn’t see her enough to get irritated by her and perhaps I’m in danger of canonising her now. But she was a living legend and now she’s done the uncharacteristic thing of actually dying she deserves a little canonisation. St Nellie in her armour on a horse. But she’d hate that. What she’d like as a memorial is for us all to continue going on as she so strove to, in search of the wonder, marking but not ignoring the mess and cruelty of life. She squeezed every drop from life and now we must do so for her sake – as well as occasionally doing a horizontal.Rest my beautiful spirit, you are free. Free to dance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1791438ae56baf00e3d43ef08745db41cb06d37/0_225_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf33318158352a03d7c966f1d8d1990","title":"rescuing run down churches friends of friendless churches england wales photo essay","story":"Sixty-odd years ago a Welsh MP along with TS Eliot and John Betjeman formed a group to save ‘ancient and beautiful’ churches from dereliction and demolition. Today, the Friends of Friendless churches keep the doors open to more than 50 of these treasuresThe Friends of Friendless Churches (FoFC) is a small charity that works to save places of worship across England and Wales, many of which face abandonment and ruin as a result of shrinking populations in rural areas.Founded in 1957 by Welsh journalist and former MP Ivor Bulmer-Thomas – a leading layman in the Church of England – the charity aims to preserve beautiful churches as public monuments that should be rightly recognised as “dispersed world heritage sites” and important components of our cultural legacy. The founding members included politician Roy Jenkins, artist John Piper, poet TS Eliot, and poet and conservation campaigner John Betjeman.According to Friends director Rachel Morley, through his vociferous campaigning Bulmer-Thomas “almost singlehandedly changed the fate of parish churches”. Having witnessed the demolition of St Peter the Less Church in Chichester in 1960, he vowed to prevent similar acts of cultural vandalism from occurring again. Bulmer-Thomas believed that “an ancient and beautiful church fulfils its primary function merely by existing. It is, in itself, and irrespective of the members using it, an act of worship. Their message is delivered – not for half hours on Sundays, but every hour of every day of every year, and not merely to those who enter, but to all who pass by.”Though Bulmer-Thomas was himself a devoted churchgoer, the mission of the Friends is not a religious one. Morley says that “we are an architectural conservation organisation”, and the aim of the Friends is to preserve beautiful places of worship as public monuments. The churches are, according to Morley, our “greatest architectural and cultural legacy … equivalent to the great cultural treasures of places such as Tuscany, Istanbul and Andalucía.”The Venerable Ambrose Mason, Archdeacon of Monmouth, says: “It is the local congregation that has the responsibility for looking after the buildings, their repair and maintenance, and if something really serious crops up – a congregation of perhaps elderly people say ‘we just can’t raise a quarter of a million pounds to repair the roof’,” so, in many cases, the decision has to be made to “walk away from the building”.This often results in churches being labelled as “unviable”, after which alternative uses for them are sought by church authorities. Morley says: “In the 1950s, many were demolished, whereas now there are better systems in place within the church commissioners and the diocese for finding an outcome.” However, this often means the buildings slip out of the “shared national heritage” into private ownership – converted into private dwellings or offices with little to no public access. Archdeacon Mason says the Friends “provide a vital role in helping to preserve the more significant local churches where the congregations have dropped to a point where they are not viable”.Morley says “These buildings are beautiful and important in and of themselves. We do not need to justify their continued existence by turning them into cafes or social security offices. The parish churches of England and Wales contain the most important art and architecture and they are vulnerable.” Many churches that are sold often appear cheap at point of purchase but due to the expense of conversion – few have electricity or water – fall into disrepair and are left locked and abandoned.The Friends has a membership of 2,000 and relies on a network of 200 volunteers around the country to keep their eyes on the buildings. Julia Pound happily describes herself as an “accidental church warden” after moving in to the property next door to Ayshford Chapel, which is cared for by the Friends. She describes her role as “sweeping it out once a week and making sure it looks loved”.In the case of St Mary the Virgin in Llanfair Kilgeddin, in Monmouthshire, the church has been cared for by a local man, Maurice Trumper, for over 25 years . The church was saved from demolition in the 1980s in what Friends chairman Roger Evans described as “a rallying point for the conservation movement” following a “tooth and nail” battle with the Church in Wales to save it. The church, an Arts and Crafts masterpiece with its original, fully restored sgrafitto paneling by George Heywood Sumner, is now the Friends’ “pride and joy”, according to Evans.Morley gives the example of the sgrafitto panels at Llanfair when describing the importance of the churches being viewed in the context of the landscapes around them. One extraordinary panel, O ye Mountains and Hills, features the landscape directly outside the church walls – the River Usk, Sugar Loaf Mountain and the tower of the nearby church of St Michael’s in Llanfihangel Gobion. Before the Friends intervention in the 1980s, the panels were scheduled to be pulled out and sent to a museum, while the rest of the building was demolished. Morley says: “The art and artwork in churches is worthy of being in any national museum. What is brilliant is that it is in context, and that could be in the middle of a field or sitting at the side of a road, and that is hugely important. Most of our churches are open 247 and we want the public to enjoy them and celebrate them because we are so lucky to have them.”The perseverance on behalf of the local communities surrounding the churches is demonstrated by the case of St Mary of the Angels in Brownshill, Gloucestershire, when in 2011 villagers purchased the church from the diocese and entrusted its care to the Friends in perpetuity. One of the great fears of the FoFC is that short-sighted decisions on behalf of church authorities looking to balance the books could seriously and irrevocably damage the nation’s greatest architectural legacy – removing centuries old buildings from existence or public access over the course of a single generation. Nearly half of the Grade I-listed buildings in England are churches, and around 30 are put up for sale or closed every year.The Friends receive no public funding in England and only modest support from the Church of Wales. Otherwise, they are entirely reliant on support from their members and donations from the general public. Though many churches petition the Friends for support, they don’t have the budget to rescue all those that are in need. In fact, the organisation has a long list of churches that are under threat or that in some cases have been closed and have stood locked and deteriorating for over 12 years. “There are more churches added to our list every quarter. Some have been on this list for well over a decade,” says Morley.The Friends stress that cared for and cherished should not mean fossilised, and instead they want offer their churches for public events such as concerts, knitting groups, seasonal lectures, art exhibitions, supper clubs and the occasional religious ceremony. They intend to carry on working tirelessly to preserve what Shakespeare described as our magnificent “sermons in stone” for generations to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f368ddb75c3c96fa33fd821028c3e594e3caab0/0_84_4736_2842/master/4736.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=212c26a39f18e77e0e81233179c6ac4a 1320w","title":"estonian minister mocks finlands sales girl pm sanna marin","story":"Estonia’s president has apologised after his country’s interior minister mocked Finland’s new prime minister – the world’s youngest serving government leader – as a “sales girl” and questioned her fitness for the post.Mart Helme, 70, the leader of the populist far-right party Ekre, ridiculed Finland’s Sanna Marin, 34, and her government – in which four out of five coalition leaders are women under 35 – on his party’s radio talkshow on Sunday.“Now we see how one sales girl has become a prime minister and how some other street activists and non-educated people have also joined the cabinet,” Helme said.Estonia’s president, Kersti Kaljulaid, asked Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, to pass on her apologies to Marin and her government.Marin, who has spoken about growing up in a disadvantaged family, worked as a cashier before studying at university and embarking on a political career.“I’m extremely proud of Finland. Here a poor family’s child can educate themselves and achieve their goals in life. A cashier can become even a prime minister,” Marin wrote on Twitter.Helme, a former ambassador to Russia, is known for outspoken statements that regularly embarrass the prime minister, Jüri Ratas, and his Centre party, Ekre’s coalition partner.Ekre was accepted into a government coalition for the first time in April after Ratas lost parliamentary elections but clinched a deal to stay in power.Kaja Kallas, an Estonian opposition leader, said on Monday that the opposition would organise a no-confidence vote in parliament if Helme did not resign over his comments about Finland’s new leaders. Previous similar attempts have failed.“The interior minister has offended the Finnish government and personally attacked the newly appointed Finnish prime minister,” Kallas said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61208769f5a463f9fff0280db71a9ed9773e303/0_48_5388_3233/master/5388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab7ee4f59c554abb6e057693a479acd3","title":"israel gideon saar moves to unseat party rival netanyahu","story":"Likud party head Benjamin Netanyahu has been weakened by corruption chargesVeteran Israeli politician Gideon Saar has launched his bid to unseat prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as head of the ruling Likud party.Netanyahu is Israel’s longest-serving leader, but he has been weakened by corruption charges that may force him out of office, as well as back-to-back failures to form a government this year.Saar’s leadership bid marks the first serious internal challenge to Netanyahu, who has served more than 10 years in office. Though Saar is still a decided underdog to the embattled prime minister, he seems to be gaining traction ahead of a party vote on Thursday next week.A former aide and senior cabinet minister under Netanyahu, Saar has long been considered a rising star in Likud and a potential future heir. But while others are patiently waiting for Netanyahu to step down on his own, Saar has been the only one who has dared to take him head on.Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases in which he is accused of trading legislative or regulatory favours in exchange for lavish gifts or favourable media coverage. He denies wrongdoing and has waged an angry campaign against the media and law enforcement officials he said are bent on ousting him from office.Outwardly, Likud members have strongly supported their leader and joined in denouncing the alleged “coup” of the liberal elites against him.But Saar’s burgeoning insurrection has begun to reveal some cracks.Around 500 party activists attended the launch of the former education minister’s campaign to unseat Netanyahu, which has been buoyed by support from a half-dozen Likud lawmakers. That includes the powerful chairman of the party’s executive body. Saar, in a jab at Netanyahu’s inability to form a government, took the podium flanked by banners with his slogan: “Only Saar Can!”While Netanyahu’s various opponents across the political spectrum have called on him to resign because of his legal woes, Saar has kept saying the party needs a new leader because Netanyahu has been unable to form a stable coalition government. He has said the prime minister is unlikely to be able to again, if given another chance.Recent polls showed that with Saar as leader, Likud would make a more powerful bloc with its natural ultra-Orthodox and nationalist allies. Saar would also be in an easier position to create a national unity government with the centrist Blue and White party if, as expected, the upcoming March election produces a deadlock like the previous two rounds have.Blue and White have ruled out serving with Netanyahu because of his indictment.Even amid the political disarray, Saar’s challenge is a risky manoeuvre in a party that fiercely values loyalty and has had only four leaders in its 70-plus-year history. Netanyahu himself has denounced Saar as “subversive”.Earlier on Monday, Saar challenged Netanyahu to a policy debate in a video released on social media.“I am waiting for you, Mr prime minister, at any time and any place you choose,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b620dab88baf3d7dbb56ed1ae845ee116b3db4/0_234_7012_4208/master/7012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42cb4f801d9faf1946b2e7f8a91b49dc","title":"malta urged to speed up moves on judicial independence","story":"Brussels calls for fast-track measures in response to Daphne Caruana Galizia murder caseThe European commission has urged the Maltese government to fast-track measures to end political interference in criminal prosecutions in response to revelations about the investigation into the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.The European justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, said recent developments in the case had highlighted systemic problems in the Maltese system.In a letter to the country’s justice minister, Owen Bonnici, Reynders demanded a timetable for strengthening the independence of judicial appointments and the establishment of a more robust prosecution service.“Recent controversies have underlined that progress should accelerate, for example on securing an effective and autonomous prosecution service with clear protections from the risk of political interference,” he wrote. “The continued concerns surrounding the investigation have put the spotlight on a number of more systemic issues.”Concerns have been voiced in Brussels that Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, is still in post despite a series of troubling revelations about his government.Muscat’s former chief of staff Keith Schembri was arrested last month by police investigating Caruana Galizia’s murder. He was released without charge in connection with the investigation and denies any wrongdoing.Yorgen Fenech, a Maltese businessman who has been charged in connection with the killing, has told a court that he received regular information about the investigation from Schembri, as well as counsel on how to respond when questioned by police.Fenech has plead not guilty to a charge of complicity in the murder and four other charges, including membership of a criminal gang. A man given immunity from prosecution has confessed to being a middleman in the murder.Muscat has said he will leave his post in January once a replacement for him has been found.Caruana Galizia’s family have accused the Maltese government of a cover-up.

That, she told him, was what she thought of his “superficial things!” So how to succeed in gifting where Frowick failed? Ditch the sable coat and keep it contemporary.Cult from first cuddle, the faux-fur teddy bear coat trend shows no sign of slumber, making it a failsafe festive gift for the fashion-minded. Where perfume fades and lingerie can let down, teddymania looks set to be a forever friend. While plenty of imitations have pulled up to the picnic, the mastermind brand behind this modern must-have is Max Mara, bundling the likes of Julia Roberts and January Jones in snow white and ruby red coats respectively.The teddy bear trend first stirred in 2013, when French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld made like a street-style Margot Tenenbaum wearing Max Mara’s now iconic voluminous, camel-coloured coat on the strade of Milan. Social media chorused “Ooh la la” and the visual went viral. After a short hibernation, Max Mara creative director Ian Griffiths jolted the teddy bear coat back to life in 2017, revived in a pure camel hair and silk upgrade from his alpaca and mohair original.Kim Kardashian West instantly plumped for the malt-coloured must-have and Hailey Bieber wore hers with a beanie and blue jeans. The teddy bear scooped a Best of the Best award for a women’s coat from the Robb Report China. Its prominence propelled further with posturing from social media stars including Eva Chen, director of fashion partnerships at Instagram, and Italian fashion journalist Anna Dello Russo, who both reached for red. This season, pick from corn kernel yellow, cornflower blue and turquoise too. Or for the regal ice-queen, opt for opulent white, as seen on fashion royalty Kaia Gerber, with white thigh-high boots in the AW19 show.Arguably, the teddy bear coat has become as era-defining as the 1940s fit-and-flare coats of Christian Dior’s new look, or the 1960s curved, cocoon coats of Cristóbal Balenciaga. Hard times, soft pile coat, we say, but the teddy bear coat is not the only Christmas chrysalis from which one can bloom.For an Ali MacGraw in Love Story meets Shiv Roy from Succession shrugged-a-camel-trenchcoat-over-her-shoulders-and-fair-isle-knit, Max Mara’s Manuela coat should cinch it.A perfect party dress coat, with its elegant camel wool pile and wide lapel collar, Manuela mascots range from Meghan Markle and Amy Adams to Katie Holmes and Jessica Biel. Gigi Hadid wears her Manuela coat casual with corresponding camel sweater and denim, while Elle Fanning rocks the candy pink style.A certain success story would be the gift of the 101801 Icon coat, a versatile wool and cashmere style created for Max Mara – and career women of the 1980s – by French fashion stylist Anne Marie Beretta in 1981. Double-breasted with kimono sleeves, this coat can elevate any ensemble, has never been out of production, and has been picked up from Isabella Rossellini to Claire Danes and Cate Blanchett.A Max Mara coat has become a sign of the times. A landmark moment came in February 2017, when Kenya-born Somali-American model Halima Aden wore a hijab on a Milan runway – making Max Mara one of the first mainstream fashion brands to feature a hijab-wearing model on the catwalk. It was the Max Mara AW17 show and her camel-coloured headscarf matched her Max Mara camel-hair coat. Last December, speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi’s fire-red funnel-neck Glamis coat made such waves in the White House and beyond that the fashion house chose to reissue the AW12 style.The teddy bear too has been on a bit of a journey. Griffiths, who studied under Ossie Clark at Manchester politan University and has headed up Max Mara design for more than 30 years, was first inspired by the label’s plush 1980s archive coats crafted from long-pile fabrics in fibres originally developed in German mills for making high-end childrens’ toys.Griffiths found the original mills to be closed and so worked with an Italian supplier to redevelop the technology to produce a unique faux fur of pure camel hair on a base of silk to create his teddy bear coat. Such an heirloom coat this Christmas will ultimately be loved long after the last pine needle drops. Revel in the renaissance.

Ian Griffiths, creative director of Max Mara, deftly wielded that power for the Italian brand’s AW19 collection. He started the show with a triumvirate of models dressed in matching looks, each one resplendent in their own tone-on-tone technicolour version. Cyan, cerulean and corn yellow: power, energy and passion.As the colour-clad models strode down the catwalk, even the assembled fashion industry audience felt a jolt – sitting up straighter, taking note and raising their smartphones in order to capture and share this fashion moment in real time.That bold use of colour was an adept move by Max Mara, whose collections are usually cocooned in a soft power palette of caramel, biscuit, toffee and honey shades. This one was no exception, as colour segued into cafe au lait, albeit imparted with a new dynamism by those opening looks.In turn soft and strong, dynamic and demure, Griffiths’ use of those stealth-wealth shades has helped cement Max Mara as a label for a quietly confident woman, one who wants her clothing to amplify her message, rather than speak for her. But – the designer has posited through his collections of late – does that woman not deserve a bit of vibrancy too, some future-is-bright optimism in equally good taste?That attitude is fitting for Max Mara, a brand that has a history of allowing actions to speak louder than words when it comes to celebrating women. Since 2005, the brand has collaborated with the Whitechapel Gallery to award the Max Mara Art Prize for Women to emerging female artists, while its Women in Film Max Mara Face of the Future award has been presented to Emily Blunt, Zoe Saldana and Rose Byrne among others since it was established in 2006.By casting Halima Aden for its AW17 show in February 2017, Max Mara became one of the first mainstream fashion brands to feature a hijab-wearing model on the catwalk. Considering how recent the date, it’s somewhat shocking to admit, but that was a huge leap for the fashion industry. It was just one small step, though, for a company that has had the empowerment of women at its core since it was founded in 1951.In post-war Italy, Achille Maramotti’s concept for a ready-to-wear clothing company that used industrialised processes was considered radical. This was a time when a woman’s clothes were handmade either professionally by a dressmaker if she had the means, or at home if she did not. Maramotti identified not only that the technology was there to mass produce, but that as women’s career opportunities emerged and grew, so too would their ability and confidence to dress as they wished.The fact that ready-to-wear clothing has now become the norm around the world indicates quite how tuned-in to the needs of women Maramotti was, a legacy that he passed on to his children along with a thriving family business.One factor in the brand’s success is the design 101801 Icon coat, a camel coat created in 1981 and kept in production for nearly 40 years. As sustainability shapes fashion choices as never before, and the idea of trends shifting season to season suddenly seems absurd, it’s hard to beat a relevancy rate nearing four decades.That success isn’t an anomaly though. In fact, Max Mara’s teddy bear coat, introduced in 2013, was another instant hit, and has remained a sellout with dusky pink, crimson and now a whole range of colour pop versions added to the original camel.It is this colourful approach to comforting classics that defines the future of Max Mara the marrying of established ideas with an energy that speaks to how women want to dress now. It’s especially true when you look at the over-the-top party wear that monopolises the fashion conversation elsewhere as the end of the year looms ever closer.Do the bright thing: the new Christmas style rulesWhat is it about Christmas that can so often lead one to see a stranger staring back from the mirror, adrift in a sea of sequins, or trussed up like a turkey?It’s time to say no more, to rewrite the rules of dressing for the festive season and the future beyond it. A bold pop of colour is the bright choice this holiday season – better to wake up, shake things up and allow the wearer to shine.Colour is key when it comes to gifting too, with Max Mara’s Bearing Gifts collection adding a touch of optimism to the occasion – think mittens in cyan that are impossible to misplace, the softest cerulean scarf to keep out the chill, or a bumbag in cobalt fuzz that can’t help but raise a smile. And what could be a better gift than that?To learn more about Max Mara’s bright and beautiful vision for the holiday season and beyond, visit maxmara"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4116943.1576520102!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nuig charity criticised over premium flights and 5 star hotel spending","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe report found over €48,000 had been spent by Galway University Foundation on business class flights between 2015 and 2017. Photograph: NUIG websiteAn investigation by the Charities Regulator into the National University of Ireland Galway’s (NUIG) fundraising charity found spending on luxury 5-star hotels, business class flights and taxi trips from Galway to Dublin were “inconsistent” with value for money policies.The charities watchdog launched an investigation into spending following concerns raised back in June 2017 over hospitality and travel expenses. Universities have foundations set up to fundraise which are technically separate but closely linked to the university.The report found over €48,000 had been spent by Galway University Foundation on business class flights between 2015 and 2017. It found on average €385 a night was spent on hotels when they were used with a mix of four and five star hotels used, which was “in excess of Revenue guidelines for overseas travel”.Hotels booked by the foundation included the five-star Grand Hyatt and the Shangri-La in Singapore, which advertises itself as a “luxurious sanctuary”.When questioned over the spending on premium travel Dr Jim Browne, who was the NUIG president and foundation director during the period, said “we’re expected to be ready for meetings, being there is important and being tired is not giving our best,” the report said.“The use of business class travel within the charity appeared to form a substantial percentage of flights taken (30 to 40 per cent of flights taken) by certain iniduals”, the report found. The spending on high end hotels and business class flights was “inconsistent with general best practice and value for money considerations,” it said.The charity spent over €10,000 on ten trips flying directors’ spouses to destinations including New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, the majority of which were business class flights.Some €7,965 of the spending was for flights for Dr Browne’s wife, the report said. The regulator’s inspectors said they found no evidence in the charity’s policies to permit covering spousal travel, and since March the foundation has stopped the practice, the report said.Galway racesIn an interview with the investigators Dr Browne said his wife’s travel was “exceptional” and only took place when required by the charity for “the purpose of building philanthropic relationships”.The report also found over the three year period more than €30,000 was spent on taxi fares, with “no substantial backup documentation on file” for the purpose of the trips and need to travel by taxi.Dr Browne travelled in 77 of the 102 taxi trips with most of the journeys being between Dublin and Galway. He told regulator officials his role was a “demanding one” with events often in the evenings followed by early morning meetings elsewhere, the report said.The former NUIG president said “it was more efficient and safer to avail of a driver than to risk driving when tired”, and taxis were used when he “could not use public transport to meet the requirements of his diary”.The regulator’s report concluded the “use of charitable monies on a taxi service for long distance travel is generally inconsistent with value for money considerations”.The report also criticised the lack of effective oversight of spending on “donor acknowledgement,” noting over €61,000 was spent on the Galway races over the three years, and nearly €10,000 on tickets to international Ireland rugby matches.The regulator’s inspector also noted that in many respects the “charity appears to be a well run organisation,” but improvements were needed in how the use of taxis were justified and documented, and there needed to be clearer distinctions between when staff were acting on business for the foundation and for the university.The regulator said while a level of donor entertainment was often required when fundraising, there was a reputational risk if the spending “appears to be excessive,” the report said.The foundation was set up in 1998 and since then has raised €146 million in donations for the university. In a statement Galway University Foundation said it welcomed the publication of the regulator’s report. “As requested, we will provide the Charities Regulator with an update on the matters raised in the report,” the statement said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Deirdre Seoighe, from Rathcoole, Co Dublin, cut short maternity leave to treat victims\u0026lsquoI am convinced we are being ripped off...It makes absolutely no sense.

Those are the lucky ones and those who shop around. There are others who have been penalised by their insurers by even more than that.Glenna Gallagher from Dublin 24 assiduously shops around for car insurance every year, and keeps track of what she pays on an excel spread sheet. The cars she drives are always modest and have never cost more than €5,000. Her mileage is low. “My car insurance was at its lowest in 2008-9 and been rising ever since,” she says. In that year she paid €306.47 for a fully comprehensive policy. Her most recent policy cost her €551. “It seems very random, and it’s very hard to know what is behind the price increases. I don’t know if it’s the insurance companies who have money or if there is something like a cartel operating in places. I do know there is definitely a lack of transparency. “It’s an absolute shocker, though. I am being asked to pay more than €500 for car insurance when I don’t know if my car is even worth that any more.” Christine Mulrooney paid €220 for her comprehensive car insurance 10 years ago and last January she paid €572.89. “I’m 41 and have a full licence since I was 19. I have never made a claim, never had any penalty points. Never had a speeding fine. No accidents. I have never even been stopped by the guards.She describes it as “just mad”, and says she can find “no explanation for it”. She could have ended up paying out even more than €572.“Every year I shop around, and last year I switched provider and saved almost €200. I am convinced we are being ripped off. I know that the amount of money paid out in claims has fallen and yet the premiums have gone up. That makes absolutely no sense. I think the Government will have to get involved.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4117249.1576525458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"arlene foster against return of 50 50 psni recruitment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster said the PSNI should be ‘in Roman Catholic schools... to tell young people how much of a good career it is for them’. Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via GettyThe re-introduction of a policy of 50:50 recruitment in order to encourage more Catholics to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) would be “a return to discrimination”, DUP leader Arlene Foster has said.Responding to a call by Archbishop Eamon Martin, the primate of All Ireland, for the reintroduction of a 50:50 recruitment policy, Ms Foster said such a policy was not “the way to do it”.She said while the DUP recognised there was an issue in regard to PSNI recruitment and “we want our police service to reflect the community it serves”, she believed “there is much more that nationalism and republicanism, especially in the leadership of political parties, could do to encourage young nationalists, young Roman Catholics to come and join the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and I hope they will do that”.The police, she said, should be “in Roman Catholic schools... to tell young people how much of a good career it is for them, and of course to take away the threat of violence.“We all know that Roman Catholic members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and indeed the prison service, have been targeted by bigots, let’s call them for what they are, so there is a job of work to be done.”Patten reformsThe policy of recruiting equal numbers of Catholic and Protestant police officers was introduced in the wake of the Patten policing reforms, and ran for ten years from 2001-2011.Approximately 32 per cent of serving police officers are from a Catholic background.Writing in The Irish Catholic following a meeting between church leaders and the PSNI Chief Constable, Simon Byrne, Archbishop Martin said this figure was “almost 20 per cent short of the percentage of young Catholics who are out there”.“If you think of that age group of young people in Northern Ireland, almost 50 per cent of those young people are Catholic and I think it should be a matter of concern, not just for Catholic communities, but indeed for the whole community.“Because if we do not have a police service which is representative of the society that it polices, you immediately begin to run into accusations that the police service is not friendly to Catholic people, or you allow a vacuum to be created which allows others to exploit intimidation and fear in communities.”In a statement, Simon Byrne said it was “vitally important” that any police service be representative of those it serves, and this was necessary “if the Police Service is to secure maximum support and confidence.”“Currently there are a number of under-represented groups within our Service which we would seek to recruit from including Catholics, working class loyalists, females, ethnic minorities and members of LGBTQ communities,” he said.A new PSNI recruitment campaign will be launched early next year.Nationalist supportBoth the North’s nationalist parties welcomed the Archbishop’s intervention, and said their stated policy was in favour of 50:50 recruitment.SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, told The  that 50:50 recruitment was “a way of beginning to solve the problem” of attacks on Catholic police officers and their families.“We also, particularly from the nationalist community, need to show support to young people who are prepared to put their neck on the line and join the police.“This is an Irish police force and we need to show support for it, and any attack on police in our community is an attack on all of us,” he said.Sinn Féin’s Northern leader, Michelle O’Neill, said the party had put it directly to Simon Byrne that “if you’re going to have public confidence in policing and its ability to deliver, and to actually deliver on the new beginning to policing” then 50:50 recruitment “has to be part and parcel of actually commanding that public confidence.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4117202.1576522895!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"complaint over institute of education better teachers ad upheld","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn response to the complaints the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street  told the advertising standards body the  slogan was “intended to be regarded as an example of puffery rather than as a statement of fact”. File photograph: Bryan O’BrienComplaints over an advertisement from the Institute of Education claiming to provider “better teachers” and “better results” have been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland (ASAI). The Institute, located on Leeson Street, Dublin, is a fee-paying school that also offers private grinds to students. Some 22 complaints were made to the advertising standards watchdog over the advert, which ran on the side of buses.The complaints claimed the advert was misleading and degrading to other teachers and education staff. Several complaints said that because the claim by the Institute to have “better teachers” and “better results” had not been substantiated it was therefore misleading. The Institutes’ fees for sixth year students for the 202021 year were €7,950, which includes a €1,000 deposit.In response to the complaints the Institute told the advertising standards body the adverts did not draw a comparison between its staff and teachers in other schools. It said it did not believe an implication could be taken from the advert that its teachers were the best. The slogan was “intended to be regarded as an example of puffery rather than as a statement of fact,” the school told the authority. The school said the claim to have better teachers and results was “clearly a subjective opinion and so could never be considered as a statement of fact”. However, the advertising authority upheld the complaints and ruled people would view the adverts as comparing the Institute’s teachers to other secondary school teachers, and in the absence of any evidence for the claims the advert was in breach of the ASAI code. Disparaging The authority also upheld complaints that the adverts could be viewed as disparaging to other schools and teachers, and ruled the advert should not reappear in its current form. The authority upheld a complaint too against Brown Thomas over an advertisement it ran on its website. The website featured a banner advertisement which stated “Free Gift with Purchase,” with a box of text underneath clarifying the customers would receive a free beauty box if they spent €200. The authority ruled that the advert was misleading as there was a need to purchase €200 worth of products before qualifying for the gift, and directed Brown Thomas must not run the advert again in its current form. Seven complaints were made over outdoor advertising from e-cigarette firm Fontem Ventures B.V, which produces the vape brand myblu. The adverts featured adult animation style figures under the tagline “we blu, do you?” and “I blu, do you?”.In response to the complaints the firm said there had been a confusion between vaping products and tobacco, and stated e-cigarette products were not subject to the same advertising restrictions as traditional cigarettes. The advertising authority rejected complaints that the adverts had targeted children, but did rule it breached the ASAI code in encouraging non-smokers to take up e-cigarettes. The authority found the phrase “we blu, do you?” could be understood as an invitation to both existing and non-users to try the product. It ruled the advert should not appear again in its current form.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty The British and Irish governments have been urged to publish a document outlining their best read of what would constitute a reasonable agreement to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly – if it is clear that the parties remain deadlocked in the current Stormont negotiations.As talks resumed at Stormont on Monday involving the five main parties and the two governments, the SDLP and Alliance leaders Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long said that the governments should disclose a document they are preparing on how best to break the logjam.Ms Long after meeting the Northern Secretary Julian Smith on Monday morning said Dublin and London had prepared a draft document on what they believed was the best way forward.Ms Long said it was not a “finished article” but was in draft form. “My advice to the governments is if they can’t get agreement around the table that they publish their draft and ask parties either to accept or reject it,” she urged.“Let’s decide once and for all, and let the public know. No more of this ‘there was a deal, there wasn’t a deal’ nonsense that we had before when things were falling apart. Let people know what was on offer, and let people know whether their elected representatives are representing them or not,” added Ms Long.The Northern Secretary Julian Smith was meeting delegations from the DUP, Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and Alliance at Stormont House on Monday morning into early afternoon while the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was due to hold bilateral meetings with the parties in the evening.A programme of work involving the parties and the two governments – when Mr Smith and Mr Coveney are available to be in Belfast- was being prepared for the rest of the week as efforts were made to strike a deal before the January 13th deadline.Legislation that allows civil servants effectively run Northern Ireland in the absence of an Executive ends on January 13th and Mr Smith has stated that thereafter he is obliged to call new Assembly elections.And while Alliance won a seat in North Down and saw its vote increase by nine per cent in the Westminster election Ms Long said she did not want an election – while adding she believed Alliance would do well if such a poll were called. “We want to see the Assembly up and running again, not an election I can’t be more clear than that.”SDLP leader Mr Eastwood also said the governments should publish what they believed was a good deal to reinstate the Executive and Assembly.”I’ve been calling on the two governments for years now to produce a document because I think that leaving this to the DUP and Sinn Féin can no longer be acceptable,” he said.“If the parties can’t come to an agreement in a couple of days I think the two governments should put a document in place and force us to either say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” he added.“Let’s get on with it. Let’s get back into the room and solve the problems,” said Mr Eastwood.Mr Eastwood said the problems to be resolved were not “big difficult issues”. “But what has been missing has been political will. I think it is now in the interests of the DUP and Sinn Féin. The electorate has spoken to them very, very loudly...the people have made it very clear, they are sick of this standoff.”And while the SDLP won two seats in the election and increased its vote by three per cent Mr Eastwood said he too did not favour fresh Assembly elections. “I think people are sick of elections. If we have an election, well we welcome it because politically in a selfish way we would welcome it. but I don’t think that is necessary. I think what we need to do is get a deal done, get back in and get on with the business of governing this place.”Around 50 healthcare workers took part in a protest outside Parliament Buildings on Monday morning, as the talks were taking place. They were accompanied by a Santa, who delivered two sacks full of petitions calling for “a safe, well staffed health service, an end to crisis waiting lists and pay parity for all workers”.Healthcare workers in Northern Ireland have been taking part in industrial action over pay and staffing levels. Nurses are due to go on strike on Wednesday for the first time in the North’s history.Among those taking part in the protest was Conor McCarthy, the chair of Unison’s health committee and the union’s representative in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.“It is breaking our hearts seeing the suffering of patients, seeing people on waiting lists, seeing procedures being cancelled,” he said. “It is horrendous.“We want devolution restored and for the Assembly to help address long-standing injustices and the pay gap here,” he said.Around 100 schoolchildren from Irish-medium schools also took part in a protest calling for the introduction of an Irish Language Act.Following Sinn Féin’s meeting with Mr Smith, party leader Mary Lou McDonald, said she had outlined to him three “ingredients for success” which she said were all “achievable”. These were the “resolution of the outstanding issues” - the “old staples” of Irish language rights, legacy issues and the reform of the petition of concern - as well as “the formation of an inclusive Executive” and “a big cash injection” which would be used to meet the demands of striking healthcare workers for pay parity with NHS staff elsewhere, though she said the party had no specific figure for the amount needed. The “big test”, Ms McDonald said, would be “political will - and that’s not new either”. Flanked by the party’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill and chief negotiator Conor Murphy, Ms McDonald told reporters outside Stormont House there was some “heavy political lifting to be done”, but declined to identify any “red lines” for the party. “It’s not helpful...for people to be setting out red lines or talking about red lines. That’s not how we understand this matter or how we articulate it,” she said, adding that she would not “go down the rabbit hole of using language that ultimately sets the process up for confrontation”. On the Irish language and on the issue of public services, she said, she believed agreement could be reached. “Everybody knows that language rights have to be met, I hope at least everybody has arrived at that conclusion,” she said. But she implied that agreement would not be reached at any cost. “People don’t need a lame duck Assembly or Executive, they need institutions of government that can deliver,” she said. “Clearly there are there are issues to be resolved and clearly we have strong positions on many issues. “What’s important is that we get an accommodation that can endure, and to endure rights have to be acknowledged and vindicated, public services have to be invested in, and every political party has to show up around the Executive table and ensure that they’re part of the solution and making the institutions of government work for everyone.” Meanwhile, the DUP leader Arlene Foster said that she and senior colleagues, MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, had a “very good engagement” with Mr Smith. The party’s former leader at Westminster Nigel Dodds, who lost his North Belfast seat in the election, did not join the delegation. Ms Foster said Mr Dodds had a number of organisational matters to sort out in relation to North Belfast. Similar to the Sinn Féin delegation, Ms Foster said there was a requirement for a “cash injection” from the British government to address a range of issues including the current health crisis, education and the economy. The DUP reluctance to concede the Sinn Féin demand for an Irish language act has been one of the key issues blocking a deal. Asked about this, Ms Foster said: “What we need to see is a new cultural and linguistic deal, one that recognises the rights, the security and confidence of everybody in Northern Ireland. We’re certainly up for that sort of a deal and I hope that the other parties will be up for that sort of a deal as well.”In relation to a possible Assembly election in January, Ms Foster said the next election was scheduled for 2022. “What we need to do is to get the Assembly up and running. That’s what people want us to do,” she said.Mr Smith said the message from the election was the public saying “loud and clear” that they wanted Stormont back. Referring to the absence of a functioning Assembly at Parliament Buildings, he said: “This empty symbol at the top of this hill cannot go on any longer. We have to govern. We have to get Northern Ireland parties governing in the best interests of the Northern Ireland citizens.”In relation to the health crisis and the demand for a pay increase for nurses and other health service staff, Mr Smith indicated that in the continuing absence of Stormont he would not be seeking special funding from the British government to deal with the matter now. He said it was primarily a devolved matter. “This can be solved by the parties coming together and moving things forward.”Mr Smith expressed reluctance to see an Executive restored without all outstanding isive issues dealt with. “I think the biggest tragedy of the talks process would be for the Executive to get up and running, and then fail. You have to address head on the major issues that need resolving. Let’s deal with them,” he said. “Let’s get the parties talking to each other and resolving them, and then let’s move forward but I think the idea that we just paint over the cracks, get it up and running and then it fails in a few weeks or a few months is not a good one.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4117226.1576523874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there is a very real window to restore the north s government says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tColum Eastwood and Clare Hannah of the SDLP with Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith arriving for talks to restore the Northern Ireland powersharing executive at Stormont House in Belfast. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere is a “very real window” to restore the North’s government that “all of us need to take”, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said at the end of the first day of talks aimed at restoring the power-sharing Assembly at Stormont.Simon Coveney met the North’s Secretary of State in Stormont House on Monday following meetings between Julian Smith and representatives from each of Northern Ireland’s five main political parties.He said the discussions had gone well, and his meeting with Mr Smith had been “very positive”.There has been no devolved government in Northern Ireland since January 2017, when the Assembly collapsed following a scandal over a renewable heating scheme.DUP leader Arlene Foster said her team had a “very good engagement” with Mr Smith.Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said her party had outlined three “ingredients for success” which she believed were “achievable”.But all sides agreed it would take “political will” to see Stormont restored.The parties are due to meet inidually with Mr Coveney ahead of roundtable discussions on Wednesday, when he said he hoped “the governments and the parties will together be able to agree a way forward”.The nurses’ strike scheduled for Wednesday, he said, was a reminder to everybody that “now is the time to get this done”.Mr Smith said the people of Northern Ireland had told politicians “loud and clear” that they want the powersharing government restored.But for that to happen, he warned, the issues that need resolving must be addressed “head on”.‘Cash injection’“I think the idea that we just paint over the cracks, get it up and running and then it fails in a few weeks or a few months is not a good one,” he said.The biggest sticking point has been an Irish Language Act, which Ms McDonald told reporters could be resolved.“Everybody knows that language rights have to be met, I hope at least everybody has arrived at that conclusion,” she said.Ms Foster said what was needed was “a new cultural and linguistic deal, one that recognises the rights, the security and confidence of everybody in Northern Ireland.“We’re certainly up for that sort of a deal and I hope that the other parties will be up for that sort of a deal as well.”Both the DUP and Sinn Féin also asked the Secretary of State for a “cash injection” to deal with the crisis in the health service which had led to spiralling waiting lists and industrial action by nurses and healthcare workers.But the leaders of the SDLP and the Alliance Party said if there is no progress, the two governments should release a document they are preparing which outlines what they believe is the best way forward.“If the parties can’t come to an agreement in a couple of days I think the two governments should put a document in place and force us to either say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” said Colum Eastwood. “Let’s get on with it.”“My advice to the governments is if they can’t get agreement around the table that they publish their draft and ask parties either to accept or reject it,” said Naomi Long. “Let’s decide once and for all, and let the public know.UUP leader, Steve Aiken, said with “goodwill” and “substantial reform” a deal might be done by the middle of January, but if that was not possible then there must be a return to direct rule.Healthcare workers and children from Irish-medium schools took part in protests outside Parliament Buildings as the talks were taking place."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

That’s the problem.”But unbeknown to the two men, the meeting was the start of a series to be captured on secret camera and form the basis of a criminal trial that would culminate at Southwark Crown Court this year, with both men and Tommy Wright, the former assistant manager at Barnsley, being found guilty of bribery following an investigation by City of London police.The revelations would shake the world of football and show how despite the Football Association’s efforts to clean up the industry, the “beautiful game” appeared to be as shady as ever.How the  covered the story During the nine-week trial, which started in October, the jury saw hours of footage recorded by undercover reporters who posed as representatives of a Far Eastern investment firm to meet Pagliara and Price.As the men sought to prove their connections to Meiran, a fictional group of investors, the agents arranged meetings with some of the top names in English football, including Harry Redknapp and Steve McClaren, the former England manager, as well as club owners.The recordings formed the basis of The ’s “football for sale” coverage, which stretched over five days in September 2016 and resulted in Sam Allardyce losing his job as England manager after he was exposed for negotiating a £400,000 business deal.As well as causing a problem for Allardyce, who had only overseen one international match by the time the revelations were published and led to him agreeing to leave his post “by mutual consent”, the coverage also created negative headlines for the Football Association when allegations of bribery and corruption appeared to be widespread.During the investigation, Pagliara and Price, along with another football agent, revealed how eight current and former Premier League managers stood accused of receiving “bungs” for player transfers.However, despite the detailed claims by the agents, The  was unable to publish the full details of who had allegedly received payments because all the managers denied the accusations, with some threatening legal action if the information was aired.But in court it was a different story. The tapes were played in full, which meant that the jury heard the agents revealing the names of the men who had allegedly accepted “bungs” to transfer players. In one meeting in Manchester, Pagliara confided in the female reporter: “There’s one thing I’ve always been able to rely on, and that is the greed of general managers.” Asked if he meant he paid people in England, he replied, “Here it’s even worse… I thought the Italians were corrupt.”This lunch became the focus of many hours of cross examination in the trial. It was here – the jury was told – that the agent made a series of unsubstantiated claims against various senior managers. He named Sir Alex Ferguson as someone he claimed he had previously paid “bribes”, including a £30,000 gold Rolex watch as a backhander.The court heard others were accused by Pagliara of taking bungs: Allardyce, Antonio Conte, the Chelsea manager at the time of the investigation and Tony Pulis, who was managing West Bromwich Albion.On a separate occasion, Pagliara was recorded claiming that McClaren, another former England manager, was also partial to payments.The agent was shown in the footage alleging that the former manager would get involved with the fake Far Eastern firm, “providing that you understand that when we do deals I have to have a carrier bag with some cash”.And Redknapp, who managed Premier league teams including Portsmouth, was also accused by Pagliara as having taken “more backhanders than Wimbledon”, the court heard.All the managers have strongly denied any improper behaviour and apart from Pagliara’s words, there is no proof that the payments he described took place.Dax Price and Tommy Wright were found guilty of briberyDuring the trial, Pagliara said he was “lying” about the payments and bribes and had not made them. He told the court that he would never pay a “bung” or behave corruptly.He said he was “showboating” and “grandstanding” when he gave the impression of being open to bribery and it was only to impress people he thought were representatives of a wealthy German sports consortium.Price’s comments about “crooked deals” also came back to haunt him during the trial.He told the undercover reporter that the “trouble” with English football was that “everyone is getting looked after” as deals were brokered to secure lucrative player transfers.Price chose not to give evidence in court, but Graham Trembath QC, his barrister, said that the agent was a “bulls******”, a Walter Mitty character who made things up and exaggerated to impress others, knowing all along that what he was promising to achieve by corrupt means could never happen.“You can’t intend that which you know would be impossible,” said Mr Trembath. Price’s barrister said his client had repeatedly said in the recorded conversations that he wanted to do things “legal”, “proper” and “above board”.But despite the denials, the bribery accusations made by both Pagliara and Price are likely to make troubling reading for the FA, as are the convictions of the two agents and a manager for bribery.The focus of the trial was a £5,000 payment that the agents had arranged to be paid to Wright, Barnsley’s assistant manager.At the beginning of August 2016, the reporter met the manager for the first time at a hotel in Sheffield.Mr Price’s comments about “crooked deals” also came back to haunt him during the trialAs they sat around a table, Price told the reporter: “Right, listen, we’ve got to give him some readies to get him started. Can we give the cash?”After the reporter agreed to “sort it out”, Wright replied: “You know where I live. Well, you don’t know where I live.”In return for the money, Wright agreed that he would help persuade Barnsley players to hire the Far East firm as their agents, as well as recommending that Barnsley sign other players represented by the consortium. He would also keep a lookout for players at other clubs that the Far East firm could approach.On Aug 11, the trio met again, this time at the Queen’s Hotel in Leeds, around the corner from the railway station – and it was here that the envelope of cash was handed over. The prosecution played sections of the tape recordings to the court where after a gesture by Pagliara, the reporter produced a white padded envelope containing £5,000 in £20 notes, saying: “Thank you for your help.”The \u0026#39s football for sale investigation Wright responded: “Cheers, just put it there,” pointing at the seat next to him.Wright faced two counts of accepting a bribe while the two football agents were both charged with two counts of paying and arranging a bribe.Barristers for the defendants told the court that the payment was for consultancy services and that there was nothing improper.Giving evidence, Pagliara, who was accused of soliciting and arranging payment of a bribe to Wright, insisted in court that the £5,000 was simply a consultancy payment for the assistant manager’s opinion of players.He denied bribing Wright with £5,000 in cash to arrange a meeting between himself and his business partner, Price, and the club’s owners.The agent said that Wright was paid in cash simply because he did not want to embarrass him in front of his bosses at Barnsley, who he claimed might discover he had been paid by another company if it went through his personal bank account.He denied attempting to arrange third party ownership of players and maintained in court that he had lied in a series of meetings with an undercover reporter as part of his strategy to persuade Meiran to buy an English football club and install him as its general manager.Price’s barrister said that it had not been his client to first raise the question of paying Wright and that he could be heard on tape at several of the meetings repeatedly emphasising that he wanted to do things “legally”. Wright told the court he was “naive” and “stupid” not to have asked for a contract and to have accepted the payment in cash, saying it was the first time he had acted as a consultant. But he denied there was anything dishonest or illegal in being paid for his opinion about players.Last week, a jury of 11 delivered a guilty verdict for Pagliara and after further deliberation, convicted Price and Wright.Jessica Walker, the head of the specialist fraud ision at the Crown Prosecution Service, said that “despite the trio’s protestations of innocence, we were able to show that they knew their actions were breaking the law.“It is thanks to the evidence gathered by The Daily  and the City of London police through their investigation that we could show beyond doubt that these men were guilty of bribery.”Football for saleBritain\u0026#39s first zero-emissions street to ban all petrol and diesel carsTen new MPs to watch: New Tory intake includes quiz show king and Prue Leith\u0026#39s speech-writer sonBoeing to halt production of 737 Max jets after fatal crashesTories to appoint Brexit supporting experts as peers in a bid to balance the \u0026#39remainiac\u0026#39 House of Lords Comment: How the Tories can convert their majority into decades of dominance in the North\tComment: Scotland risks being trapped in constitutional navel-gazing while rest of UK moves onFootball for sale: Calls for Football Association to investigate scandalBoris Johnson to use huge majority to enshrine 2020 Brexit date in law -

meaning it did not prove that the dietary habits led to the improved mortality rates. Overall, around four per cent of all those in the study died during the eight years they were tracked. Dr Ian Johnson, nutrition researcher at Quadram Institute Bioscience, said chilli eaters may just be healthier overall.He said: “This type of relationship suggests that chillies may be just a marker for some other dietary or lifestyle factor that hasn’t been accounted for.”Professor Licia Iacoviello, of the University of Insubria, Varese, said: Chilli pepper is a fundamental component of our food culture. We see it hanging on Italian balconies, and even depicted in jewels.Over the centuries, beneficial properties of all kinds have been associated with its consumption, mostly on the basis of anecdotes or traditions, if not magic.It is important now that research deals with it in a serious way, providing rigour and scientific evidence.And now, as already observed in China and in the United States, we know that the various plants of the capsicum species, although consumed in different ways throughout the world, can exert a protective action towards our health.Britain\u0026#39s first zero-emissions street to ban all petrol and diesel carsTen new MPs to watch: New Tory intake includes quiz show king and Prue Leith\u0026#39s speech-writer sonBoeing to halt production of 737 Max jets after fatal crashesComment: How the Tories can convert their majority into decades of dominance in the North\tBoris Johnson to use huge majority to enshrine 2020 Brexit date in law - with or without a trade dealComment: Scotland risks being trapped in constitutional navel-gazing while rest of UK moves onFootball for sale: How the \u0026#39s undercover reporter exposed the dark underbelly of the beautiful gameFootball for sale: Calls for Football Association to investigate scandalTories to appoint Brexit supporting experts as peers in a bid to balance the \u0026#39remainiac\u0026#39 House of Lords Emily Thornberry threatens to sue over claims she called voters stupid, as condemnation of Jeremy Corbyn mountsSubpostmasters \u0026#39vindicated\u0026#39 as high court finds IT system had \u0026#39bugs and defects\u0026#39, paving way for further legal actionBritish Airways pilots who went on strike in September accept new pay dealGrant Shapps will enshrine the \u0026#39basic right\u0026#39 of commuters to get to work into lawArgentina gang behind British tourist murder held welcome signs in airport arrival, say officialsGeneral election 2019: Nicky Morgan stays on as Culture Secretary after being elevated to Lords  - latest newsCould \u0026#39no nonsense northerner\u0026#39 Lisa Nandy be elected Labour leader?Comment: Boris won because he has never pretended to be anything other than himself - unlike Jeremy CorbynHuw Edwards has called accusations of BBC bias \u0026#39toxic cynicism\u0026#39, saying they have been created to \u0026#39cause chaos\u0026#39Resurfacing of past sexism claims rocks Mike Bloomberg\u0026#39s White House bidIrish Rail bans re-usable cups because of safety concernsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/16/08/stars.jpg","title":"alien space lights unexplained vanishing star vasco","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Vanishing, bright stars\u0026nbsplikely to be from \u0027natural, if somewhat extreme, astrophysical sources\u0027, say astronomers – but could change our understanding of the universe whatever they areScientists are investigating strange blinking lights in the sky for indications that they are signs of interstellar communication lasers or alien structures.A number of appearing and vanishing objects have been spotted among the stars and are puzzling the scientists who are trying to understand what they are.Astronomers believe the lights will probably be coming from natural, if somewhat extreme, astrophysical sources. But they are yet to find any explanation, after discovering 100 of the lights.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhatever scientists find it likely to change our understanding of space, potentially ushering in a new astrophysics, scientists said.The implications of finding such objects extend from traditional astrophysics fields to the more exotic searches for evidence of technologically advanced civilisations, the authors write in the new paper.In the research, detailed in a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal, scientists looked at publicly available images of the sky dating as far back as the 1950s, such as old military sky catalogues. They compared those historical observations with modern sky surveys, looking for physical indicators that included stars that appear to have disappeared from the Milky Way.Finding an actually vanishing star –\u0026nbspor a star that appears out of nowhere! –\u0026nbspwould be a precious discovery and certainly would include new astrophysics beyond the one we know of today, said project leader\u0026nbspBeatriz\u0026nbspVillarroel, Stockholm University and\u0026nbspInstituto\u0026nbspde\u0026nbspAstrofísica\u0026nbspde\u0026nbspCanarias, Spain.Water is ‘common’ on alien worlds, scientists sayUsually, a dying star will change very slowly to become a white dwarf, or die with a sudden explosion as a supernova. A vanishing star would therefore indicate something else entirely: either a new, natural astrophysical phenomena or extraterrestrial activity elsewhere in the universe.The only known natural explanation for such a vanishing star would be a failed supernova, which has been theoretically predicted to be what happens when a very massive star collapses into a black hole, without sending out any kind of explosion. But those are very rare.Possible extraterrestrial explanations include lasers being sent through the universe as part of communication between stars, or Dyson spheres, which are theoretical structures that alien civilisations could build around a star and harness its energy. While both are hypothetically possible, no evidence for either has ever been discovered.Scientists have already look at 15 per cent of the possible candidate objects they have in their data, and found about 100 of the objects they called red transients. Some of them are behaving very dramatically, flaring up to become several thousands\u0026nbsptimes brighter very quickly.We are very excited about following up on the 100 red transients we have found, said\u0026nbspBeatriz\u0026nbspVillarroel\u0026nbspin a statement.They hope to launch a new\u0026nbspproject that will use citizen science and artificial intelligence to comb through the remaining 150,000 candidates that have already been identified.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s been other techniques to combine the two in the past but they don’t end up with pictures that are nice to look at.”Spectral Edge is the second acquisition of a UK startup\u0026nbspfor Apple this year, following the takeover of digital marketing startup DataTiger\u0026nbspin February.The technology giant will be hoping the latest buyout can offer a critical edge over competitors when it comes to camera performance, which has become one of the key differentiators between high-end smartphones in recent years.Apple is not expected to release a new iPhone until September 2020, meaning there is plenty of time to integrate Spectral Edge’s technology into its devices.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last week, the Coalition for Reform in Political Advertising branded the ads the nation was (mis)treated to as “indecent, dishonest and untruthful” in a report entitled How Political Advertising in the 2019 General Election Let Us Down.\u0026nbspThe non-partisan organisation – one of the more worthy recipients of crowdfunding that I’ve seen – highlighted ads from the Tories, Labour, the Lib Dems\u0026nbspand the Brexit Party, while providing an explanation for why each example was problematic.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pub chain owner and prominent Brexit supporter saw the value of his stake in the pub chain jump almost 10 per cent from £487m to £531m.Mr Martin had backed the Brexit Party, which failed to secure a single seat, but he will likely be pleased with the result in any case after a Tory landslide prompted Wetherspoon shares to rise from\u0026nbsp1,482p to 1,619p.Boris Johnson’s decisive win boosted the pound and sent shares in a number of UK companies soaring\u0026nbspon the hopes that uncertainty around Brexit will now fade away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Martin has been one of the few business leaders to vocally back leaving the EU. He spent £94,856 on pro-Brexit beer mats and\u0026nbsphas regularly used the pub group’s magazine to promote the benefits of leaving.The company’s updates to the stock market have also been used as a platform to rail at EU rules and bureaucracy.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because before people judge and go ‘Kevin Hart’s a d*******, he’s an a******, I want you to understand that there’s a lot that you don’t know.”Created with Sketch.10 most-searched for films of 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Bill Skarsgård in \u0027It Chapter Two\u0027Jason Momoa in \u0027Aquaman\u0027Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in \u0027Green Book\u0027Olivia Colman in \u0027The Favourite\u0027710 4.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the focus of the imags is the bright blue centre of the image, which was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope as it tracked the comet through space.The picture shows the comet on its way through our solar system as it makes its way back into the interstellar space where it once flew.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines2IBorisov was first spotted in August by a Crimean amateur astronomer who would give it its name, and caused a flurry of excitement across the world. Scientists quickly determined that it was the second interstellar object known to have visited our solar system, after the famous \u0027Oumuamua, and the first comet.Since then, scientists have been taking images of the comet as it moves nearer to the Earth and can be seen in better detail. The first observations from Hubble came in October, and the new images come from November and December, offering a better look at the size and other details of the visitor.When this image was taken, the object was 326 million kilometres from Earth. Scientists can now use it and other observations to learn more about the comet.Scientists finally decide on real identity of OumuamuaHubble gives us the best measure of the size of comet Borisov\u0027s nucleus, which is the really important part of the comet, said David Jewitt, a professor of planetary science and astronomy at the University of California Los Angeles, whose team has captured the best and sharpest images of this first interstellar comet.Surprisingly, our Hubble images show that its nucleus is more than 15 times smaller than earlier investigations suggested it might be. The radius is smaller than half a kilometre. This is important because knowing the size helps us to determine the total number, and mass, of such objects in the Solar System, and in the Milky Way. Borisov is the first known interstellar comet, and we would like to know how many others there are.Scientists now expect to see other interstellar objects, and compare those with the two mysterious objects they have already been able to see.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy).

The rapid rise in streaming services in recent years has led some industry experts to warn of a new appetite for piracy.Global piracy authority Muso\u0026nbspsaid an increasingly fragmented streaming services landscape had led to content saturation among users, which has only been made worse by the launch of new platforms from Apple, Disney and BritBox\u0026nbspin 2019.Research published by Muso earlier this year revealed that UK audiences made over 5.7 billion visits to piracy sites in 2018 - a figure that will likely increase this year. The research also found that more than 80 per cent of people believed they were paying too much for content streaming.Premier League caught up in \u0027world\u0027s biggest piracy operation\u0027Expecting consumers to pay almost £100 a month for access to content may well be a challenge. So much of it is siloed off and exclusive across so many different paid-for platforms, that it\u0027s difficult for consumers to subscribe to everything they want, said Andy Chatterley, CEO of Muso.This research shows that people will inevitably seek it elsewhere via unlicensed platforms.Others believe that there is still room for growth within the streaming market and that competition will continue as new technology and platforms emerge.\u0026nbspBill Demas, CEO of streaming analytics firm Conviva, said the State of the Streaming TV Industry report in August proved the industry is nowhere near saturation point, as online viewing figures continue to increase each year.Despite extraordinary growth, streaming is still a nascent market. As the data shows, audience appetites for content are on the rise with more ways to consume than ever before, he said.It\u0027s imperative that both established players and new entrants recognise that every stream matters and take steps to address all dimensions of their streaming media business.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its stars were not formed in one continuous process, they say – but instead in a bright flash that lit up the galaxy.Our unprecedented survey of a large part of the Galactic centre has given us detailed insights into the formation process of stars in this region of the Milky Way, says\u0026nbspRainer\u0026nbspSchödel\u0026nbspfrom the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain, who led the observations.Contrary to what had been accepted up to now, we found that the formation of stars has not been continuous, adds Francisco\u0026nbspNogueras-Lara, who led two new studies of the Milky Way central region while at the same institute in Granada.In the study, researchers found that roughly 80 per cent of the stars in our Milky Way were formed during its earliest years, between about eight and 13.5 billion years ago. After that came about six billions years during which very few stars were born.Nasa announces first results from spacecraft sent to \u0027touch the sun\u0027But that quiet period was brought to a dramatic close with a crescendo of star formation, roughly a billion years ago, when stars with a mass of up to a few tens of million Suns formed in its centre over the course of just 100 million years.That area is now relatively quiet, birthing stars at a rate of one or two of our own Suns each year. But the new observations from the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope (VLT) allowed to look at it and peer into its path, and how it would have looked in its past.The conditions in the studied region during this burst of activity must have resembled those in \u0027starburst\u0027 galaxies, which form stars at rates of more than 100 solar masses per year, said\u0026nbspNogueras-Lara, who is now based at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, in a statement.This burst of activity, which must have resulted in the explosion of more than a hundred thousand supernovae, was probably one of the most energetic events in the whole history of the Milky Way.This newly understood period was not simply a flurry of births but of deaths, too. The massive stars that are born in a starburst live for less time than lower-mass stars, dying much sooner in spectacular supernova explosions.The new discoveries were accompanied by a spectacular picture of the Milky Way\u0027s central region, and both relied on new capabilities of the ESO\u0027s\u0026nbspmost famous telescope. New instruments allowed the researchers to look through the dust and gas that surrounds the region, and pick up new details that had never been seen before.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But they can’t make up s*** about me – and if they do, I have to take it to the courts.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesMs Flint said that Putney and Canterbury – two Labour seats in the south – were not a fair exchange for the dozens of northern seats that had been lost to Boris Johnson.The party had “gone too much towards the metropolitan cities and university towns and away from these core areas and it breaks my heart”, she warned.And she said: “I don’t believe anybody who has been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is credible to be leader.

He also needs to tell us who is getting sacked for it.”The infighting will be vicious but Labour must reconnect with voters Here’s how Labour can rebuild the red wall – starting with my hometownPublic support for nationalisation increased under Corbyn, poll findsThornberry starts legal action against Flint for ‘stupid voters’ claimJonathan Reynolds, the shadow economic secretary, said: “Clearly many things went wrong for us in this campaign, but the quality of the campaign itself was bad and I would expect the people who ran that campaign to be leaving. I don’t think it’s tenable for those people to stick around.”A meeting of officers of the party’s ruling National Executive Committee later this week is expected to agree a leadership contest beginning on 7 January and lasting eight to 10 weeks, meaning Mr Corbyn’s replacement may not be in post until the start of April. But it was not clear whether the full NEC – including representatives of the parliamentary Labour Party, unions and constituency parties – will be asked to meet to approve the timetable.There are concerns that Corbyn supporters may seek to impose a long campaign to give him more time in charge to direct the succession and a late cut-off point for new members to be entitled to vote for the leader, allowing the recruitment of more sympathisers.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the NEC isn’t going to meet, that’s another matter. I think that would concern a lot of people.”Mr Reynolds said it was vital that a new leader is in place by the end of March, to give him or her a chance to mount an effective campaign for local and mayoral elections on 7 May.With potential contenders for the leadership testing the water before deciding whether to mount a bid,\u0026nbspRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was emerging as the favoured candidate of senior figures around Mr Corbyn, while Lisa Nandy was attracting interest from those thinking the party needs to change direction in response to the loss of long-held seats in the midlands and the north.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is understood to be considering a pitch for the deputy leader position vacated by Tom Watson ahead of the election, while backing her friend\u0026nbspMs Long-Bailey for the top job.Meanwhile, another potential leadership hopeful,\u0026nbspEmily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, was embroiled in a bitter row with ousted MP Caroline Flint, consulting lawyers after her former colleague refused to withdraw claims she called Labour Leave voters “stupid”.A number of ex-MPs who lost seats in former Labour strongholds are in discussions with the parliamentary Labour Party about the possible launch of an informal inquiry into the reasons for the collapse in support in the midlands and north, separate from the leadership’s “process of reflection” announced by Mr Corbyn.Former minister Pat McFadden said the new leader must represent a break from the Corbyn era.“The greatest mistake the Labour Party could make now would be to trot out the excuses that we have heard over recent days, that it’s all Brexit’s fault or the media’s fault or – worst of all – that we won the argument,” Mr McFadden told Sky News.“None of those things will wash.“Unless we learn the fundamental depth of our defeat and have a big change of direction, all we will do is keep\u0026nbsphanding power to the Conservatives and that is not why the Labour Party exists. We exist to win power, not to come second in a two-horse race.”He warned: “If the next leader is ‘continuity Corbyn’, that would be the greatest mistake the Labour Party could make. The strategy of rejecting every lesson we learnt in order to win in the 1990s and 2000s has been tested and tested to destruction.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey.

One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school.

She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13.

She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”.

He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole.

It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our god was Lenin,” says Sheikh Nuri Shekhnamati, a priest at the Quba Sultan Ezid, a Yazidi temple in the capital Tbilisi.“People were more humane. With today’s wild capitalism we struggle to live day by day. The time came for religion. Religion can help. Everyone needs some kind of spirituality,” he adds.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe temple sits on top of a hill in the outskirts of Tbilisi, surrounded by crowded Soviet-era housing blocks on one side, and a ghostly new Chinese-built mall, the biggest one in the Caucasus, on the other. It was a typically quiet day at the temple, and Shekhnamati made us tea and offered us sweets as we sat with him in the kitchen.Yazidis are a Kurdish-speaking religious minority from northern Iraq. While most of the population lives in Iraq today, there were two waves of migration to the Caucasus in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some Yazidis identify as ethnic Kurds, others as ethnic Yazidis, and this debate can be isive.Yazidi temple in the world outside of IraqThe monotheistic religion has no holy book, and its sacred texts are orally transmitted by members of their priestly castes, such as Shekhnamati, who was born into a family of priests known as sheikhs. Yazidi priests do not formally teach the religion to their followers and many sacred texts are hidden from non-Yazidis. Until recently, no temples were built outside of the Yazidi heartland in Iraq.In the Caucasus, the modernising drive of the Soviet Union caused many members of the priesthood to lose this orally transmitted knowledge.\u0026nbsp“I started learning the texts later in life, in my mid-20s. I was more interested in my professional career, but people kept asking me to learn the religion,” he recalls. “I had no right to refuse: I was the son of a sheikh.”\u0026nbspInstead, he studied electrical mechanics for trains and subway systems, and in his last job before joining the temple, he fixed street lamps. He lives with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren, in a flat in an old housing blocks not far from the temple.Social upheavals and political transitions took their toll on the survival of the Yazidi religion in Georgia. “Our community was dying out,” says Dimitri Pirbari, the temple’s spiritual leader. But mobilising a community with no book, no institutions and no centralised structure proved the biggest challenge.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With its single spire and bare-walled interiors, it is modelled on the mausoleum of Lalish, the main Yazidi pilgrimage site in northern Iraq.On the other side of the grounds, a pyramid-shaped glass building serves as a centre for Georgian and Kurdish language lessons, and a recently launched course teaching the Yazidi religion and its history to any member of the public. Hanging on the centre’s walls are archival photographs, including an image of Tbilisi’s Yazidi community at a march commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution in 1938. \u0026nbspThe process of assimilation is really evident in our community. We’re losing our language and our religion. We don’t have a homelandIt was the response from a community that had come dangerously close to losing its presence in Georgian society.\u0026nbsp“The process of assimilation is really evident in our community. We’re losing our language and our religion. We don’t have a homeland,” says Lili Safarova, a Tbilisi-based women’s and education activist who was involved in the initial stages of the temple’s creation. “We needed a space to continue our language and our traditions.”At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Yazidi community of Georgia numbered around 33,000. The rise of Georgian nationalism and ongoing civil war in the 1990s caused waves of migration to Russian cities and later to Europe. By 2002, the number of Yazidis living in Georgia had halved to around 18,000. In 2014, fewer than 12,000 remained.\u0026nbspIn religiously conservative Georgia, where the Orthodox Church’s influence plays a powerful political role, the creation of a dedicated space for the Yazidi community in Tbilisi took more than two decades from conception to reality.The idea of a temple and cultural centre was floated as early as the 1990s. The land was then acquired from the government in 2007, and permission to build a temple was granted by Patriarch Ilya II in 2010. The Yazidi religion was officially recognised as a public entity in Georgia in 2011.Political reforms after Georgia’s Rose Revolution of 2003 facilitated the process. Georgia is home to many minorities and religions, and Tbilisi has historically been a erse and cosmopolitan hub city.\u0026nbspBut after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and until 2005, no religion other than the Georgian Orthodox Church could be officially registered. Amendments to the civil code in 2011 allowed minority religions to register as public entities.\u0026nbsp“We advocated the issue because it gave legal status to all our organisations. We did not have this possibility before,” says Agit Mirzoev, a Tbilisi-based public defence lawyer who is involved in the temple and spiritual council’s registration.The Soviet Union suppressed religion, but it supported the Kurdish culture and folklore of Tbilisi’s Kurdish-speaking community, who were predominantly Yazidis. In Tbilisi, a Kurdish theatre run by the community held regular performances, but it stopped operating in the early 1990s, after Georgia’s independence. \u0026nbsp“I can count on my fingers the number of Georgian\u0026nbspYazidis\u0026nbspwho’ve come out of poverty. Many do not pursue a higher education“The theatre was a source of pride for us at the time. For the children of a generation that was predominantly illiterate, to be writing records of our culture and history...” recalled Vitali Nabiev, a Yazidi journalist from Tbilisi who now lives in France.\u0026nbspWith the absence of a dedicated space, Kurdish nationalist groups from the Middle East filled the vacuum. The Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) had an office in Tbilisi and was active in the 1990s, transmitting extremist literature, recruiting fighters and facilitating travel to Turkey through Moscow. Leaders of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq also supported cultural activities such as radio stations and newspapers, and made donations to the existing temple.Today, while inter-ethnic tensions have softened in Georgia since the 1990s, economic and social issues remain for the Yazidi community.\u0026nbsp“I can count on my fingers the number of Georgian Yazidis who’ve come out of poverty. Many do not pursue a higher education. Until recently, many did not have faith in the electoral system and did not participate in elections,” says Isko Daseny, a Georgian parliamentarian and member of the Yazidi community.But the biggest threat for the community is the loss of identity.\u0026nbspSince its opening, the activity at the temple has trickled slowly into the lives of Yazidis in Tbilisi. “I come here three to four times a month with my family,” says Rafael Adjamyan, a young resident of Tbilisi. “When I was growing up we could only dream of a space like this. There are a lot of rumours about our religion. We needed a space to get accurate and reliable information.”\u0026nbspBut overall visitor figures are unclear. “It’s difficult to say how many people come,” says Shekhnamati, “On a busy day, we get up to 100 people. But yesterday nobody came, and the day before that 20 visitors.” Of the approximately 1,000 Yazidis he estimates live in the vicinity, only some 300 visit the temple.Rather, the traditions of Yazidis in the Caucasus are centred around the community’s homes and cemeteries. The religion’s strict caste system assigns the role of religious teachings to pirs, which means elder in Kurdish, or sheikhs. Every Yazidi has their own pir and sheikh, including the pirs and sheikhs themselves. Yazidis visited leaders from the priestly castes of pirs and sheikhs for weddings, funerals and other holy days. \u0026nbsp“For spiritual matters, I go to my pir,” says Emma Kalashov, a retired cleaner living in one of the vast housing units of Varkatili, a neighbourhood near the temple – “My pir is my temple.” Her visits to the physical temple, she adds, are limited. “I may go four times a year, when my family visits from abroad.”Emma’s pir, Edik Pir Drbes, lives in her building. On the door to his flat is a small sticker of Lalish’s conical spires, and large peacock-shaped ornaments line the walls and shelves of his living room.\u0026nbspAnd though Yazidis do not have a book, Pir Drbes has a large peacock-emblazoned book-shaped case high on a plinth against the back wall.I was 10 years old. My father died young so my brother taught me what he had learnt from our grandfather. I visited families with him and learnt that wayPir Drbes describes the mysticism at the heart of the religion and its language. “Nobody can see God Himself. I associate God with the sun, and I pray facing the sun,” he explains.\u0026nbspIn addition, Yazidis believe in seven holy beings, headed by an archangel, Tawus Melak, who takes the form of a peacock. “Melak tawus is an angel coming from God – he has power and reigns on everything on earth,” says Pir Drbes. “After God the most respected persons in our culture are our parents.”“No religious event can happen without the presence of a pir or sheikh,” explains Pir Drbes. “We are there for weddings and funerals to recite prayers. With our own hands, we sew white clothes for the dead before they are buried.”\u0026nbspPir Drbes was initiated to the religion’s sacred oral traditions from a young age. “I was 10 years old. My father died young so my brother taught me what he had learnt from our grandfather. I visited families with him and learnt that way.”In his bedroom, he shows us his ster, a shrine consisting of stacked mattresses, which is found in Yazidi households in the Caucasus. Academics believe this tradition emerged out of the originally nomadic nature of Caucasian Yazidis.\u0026nbsp“When we were cut off from Iraq we created these domestic altars in our homes. When the sun is not visible, I open this shrine and pray to it,” he explains.\u0026nbspHe pulls out a plastic bag from within the mattress heap, which contains soil, cotton string and pearl-shaped clay balls gathered from his recent trips to Iraq. \u0026nbspPirs and sheikhs typically receive alms from their followers. But grinding poverty in the Caucasus caused many to turn away from spiritual matters. “The church charges very high fees for its services, but as Yazidi priests, we take whatever our followers can give us,” says Pir Drbes. \u0026nbspAs he drove us through the sprawl of housing blocks to the local cemetery in his 4x4 German car with leather seats, with the letters “P – IR” on his license plate, Pir Drbes explained that he does not have a job other than his spiritual role. “I prefer to serve the people.”\u0026nbspBy contrast to the informal, unwritten traditions described by Pir Drbes, the leaders at the temple pursue an active spiritual, educational and political strategy. “Our first aim is to be recognised as an institutionalised religion. Without this it’s difficult to dialogue with other religions,” explains Pirbari.The Yazidi religion has no institutional hierarchy. There is one political leader, the Mir, and important religious figures who form a spiritual council in Iraq. But when the Yazidi Spiritual Council of Georgia was registered in 2011, it appointed its own spiritual leader.\u0026nbspPirbari dresses in white cotton robes and headband, typical of a priest in rural Iraq. Greeting us in the reception room, he recalls his nostalgia for Dighomi, the neighbourhood which he grew up in Tbilisi. Like much of the city, it has been affected by ongoing uncontrolled construction. On the wall behind him is a painting of the mausoleum at Lalish, and on the adjacent wall hangs a northern Iraqi rug.\u0026nbspMy studies in ethnology show\u0026nbspYazidism\u0026nbspis an ethnicity and a religion. We are not Kurds. We have the right to self-identify“I want the spiritual content of the Yazidi religion to inform the daily lives of Yazidis,” explains Pirbari.\u0026nbspAs such, the temple has revived rituals which did not previously exist among Yazidis in the Caucasus. Pirbari has strong connections to the spiritual leadership in Iraq, and In June this year, the temple brought in qewwals, members of the Yazidi spiritual castes whose role is to sing sacred texts, and who only live in Lalish, Iraq. “There was a lot of admiration for them,” says Pirbari, “It is one of the ways in which we are trying to recover our traditions.”Some view the temple in Tbilisi as a contemporary expression of the religion. “They’re trying to create a ‘modern’ form of Yazidism that could be seen as more ‘systematic’ and understandable to the younger generation,” says Khanna Omarkhali, an Associate Professor at the Free University of Berlin and a member of the Yazidi priesthood.The temple extols the view that Yazidis are a distinct ethnic group. “My studies in ethnology show Yazidism is an ethnicity and a religion. We are not Kurds. We have the right to self-identify,” insists Pirbari.\u0026nbspThis is partly in response to the fact that, for decades, the Yazidi community has been caught between different parties of the Kurdish struggle in the Middle East. “We don’t want to be part of these political games,” says Mirzoev. “We have peaceful aims as citizens of Georgia.”The educational centre, named the “Theology Academy”, teaches religion, language and history, and is the first of its kind in the world. A Department of Yazidism, headed by Pirbari, will soon be created at the Tbilisi’s Ilya State University’s Institute of Oriental Studies.\u0026nbspBut given the oral nature of the religion, this educational dimension is also met with scepticism.“Yazidi priests do not learn their religion in schools. We inherit the knowledge from our parents and grandparents,” says Reza Muradyan, a young priest and shop owner from Tbilisi. “We can’t talk – at least until now – about an explicit theology among Yazidis, first of all because they do not have a sacred writ,” adds Omarkhali.The spiritual council also acts as a political engine. “We are more mobilised and self-organised than ever. We have good communications with the government and with other religions in Georgia, especially the Georgian Orthodox Church,” adds Mirzoev.\u0026nbsp“We want to be part of a process which facilitates peaceful relationships between different world religions,” says Pirbari.\u0026nbsp“We openly declare humane values of mutual respect and love.” Pirbari has facilitated meetings for the Yazidi spiritual leadership in Iraq with the Vatican and Russian patriarchate, among others. Above his desk in his office\u0026nbspis a gold-plated, peacock-shaped relief sculpture which was a gift from the Iranian cleric Ayatollah Shahrestani. \u0026nbspBut the temple’s emphasis on the religious aspects of the Yazidi culture has attracted criticism from some quarters. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn downtown Tbilisi’s House of Friendship, a Soviet-era administrative building with an elaborate modernist facade, Safarova, the women’s activist, describes her concerns: “Today the space is run by a small number of religious persons who have alienated the young in particular.”Many members of the community are not recognised by the temple, including Georgian\u0026nbspYazidis\u0026nbspfrom mixed marriages“The original idea was to have a public cultural centre and a small temple. The young would come to the cultural centre, join its educational activities, and also learn about their religion.” he says, when we met him in his office in the northern suburbs of the capital.Partly, the view that Yazidis are an ethno-religion has been isive. “Our critics are an old guard red star intelligentsia, most of them atheists,” says Pirbari, referring to the fact that the Soviet Union supported Kurdish culture and banned religion. Nonetheless, respondents interviewed for this article of all ages identified as ethnic Yazidis, Kurds or Yazidi-Kurds.Further, many members of the community are not recognised by the temple, including Georgian Yazidis from mixed marriages. “We welcome everyone, from every religion at our temple,” says Pirbari. “But according to our religion, we cannot recognise Yazidis that come from mixed marriages as Yazidis. We will welcome them as members of another religion.”\u0026nbsp“We are fighting for survival, not radicalism,” insists Pirbari. But others disagreed. “We wanted a space that would unite us,” says Safarova, “but now we are ided.”Read the first part in the series, here:\u0026nbspEmerging from Isis genocide, Yazidis in Armenia open religion’s biggest ever templeShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way. Now we are told that the scariest stepmother since Cinderella’s has decided to buy her long-suffering family, including her -year-old mum, Botox vouchers for Christmas.Obviously there’s a money-making opportunity here, as Kris has signed up to promote a Botox company offering  gt tokens as seasonal presents.And I suppose eventhey are insulted or unhappy about her gt, they won’t be able to show those emotions on their newly frozen faces.So Kris wins again.I’M deeply concerned and extremely angry about the current mumps epidemic among hundreds of university students.Since this summer, more than , cases of this dangerous and infectious disease have been reported. If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, he won’t be.“He will be remembered as a sexual predator and an unrepentant abuser who took everything and deserves nothing.“He will be remembered by the collective will of countless women who stood up and said enough.“We refuse to let this predator rewrite his legacy of abuse, the women said in a statement to Page Six.”Speaking to Page Six from his flashy hospital room, Weinstein insisted he was only going ahead with the unprecedented interview to prove he wasnt exaggerating his back pain.The -year-old, who is awaiting trial for rape, says he sustained a back injury in August for which he has recently undergone a three hour surgery.Recent court appearances have seen the mogul using a walking frame with some suggesting that he was exaggerating his injuries to garner sympathy - which he vehemently denies, adding: I think they wanted to embarrass me.The alleged sex-pest used the interview to launch a bizarre pity-party, insisting: I want this city to recognize who I was instead of what I’ve become.He continued: It all got eviscerated because of what happened...My work has been forgotten.Weinstein refused to discuss his criminal charges - including rape, predatory sexual assault and criminal sex acts - all of which he denies - throughout the unprecedented chat.According to the interviewer, he snapped: Ill move on when asked uncomfortable questions.Wientstein also moaned that he had made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, bizarrely insisting that he pioneered women in film despite the slew of allegations against him.He said: I’m talking about  years ago.

I pioneered it!This was a company that took social issues and tackled them.He even bragged about what a lucrative contract he gave to Gwyneth Paltrow - one of his alleged victims.The actress is not part of the tentative  million civil settlement reportedly reached between Weinstein, his bankrupt film studio The Weinstein Company, and more than  of his accusers last week.The Hollywood heavyweight will go on trial in January to face five allegations of sexual assault - all of which he strongly denies.He is also alleged to have mishandled a compulsory monitoring device which he also addressed in the interview insisting the allegations were made to smear him.He said: “If you remember who I was then, you might want to question some of this.”Weinstein is accused of first degree rape, third degree rape, criminal sexual act and two counts of predatory sexual assault.The charges relate to two incidents involving two women - one who says she was raped by him in March , and one who says he forced her into performing a sex act on him in .He denies all the allegations against him.The ex-movie mogul faces le in prisonhes convicted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than  fresh-faced new Tories are among those coming to Parliament for the first time thanks to Boris Johnsonaposs resounding victory. Many have long and storied careers ahead of them. But some of them have a few skeletons in their past too. Weaposve looked at some of the new MPs who landed themselves in controversy before they even arrived in their new offices in Westminster. Brendan Clarke-SmithThe Tory who ousted Labour in Bassetlaw told a hustings food banks were being used too often as a top up and a political weapon.Explaining the huge rise in foodbanks he said: If you keep saying to people that you’re going to give stuff away, then you’re going to have an increase I’m afraid. He said food banks should only be a short-term solution and it was simply not true that Britain is some kind of country in crisis and in absolute poverty. He later told the Mirror the reaction to his comments was staged outrage. He added: I stand by the fact itaposs been weaponised. I donapost obviously believe that everybody who uses a food bank is just taking advantage, I think thataposs actually very rare. Ian LevyThe Tory who took Blyth Valley, Labour since , was accused of misleading the public after a Facebook post that described him as an NHS nurse was quietly edited.The post dated November  originally said: As an NHS nurse myself, I am immensely proud of the investment by our Conservative government. This post was edited  days later to describe him as an NHS mental health nursing assistant.  A local NHS worker told the Mirror that despite sounding similar, the two roles were very dferent and colleagues were angry that he would lie about being a nurse to win votes. Mr Levy did notrequests for comment. Karl McCartney The MP who seized Lincoln back from Labour apologised during the campaign for retweeting a post claiming Tommy Robinson had been imprisoned for aposreporting on Muslim paedophilesapos. Mr McCartney also shared a letter from Tommy Robinson with his followers in which the extreme right-winger claimed his murder by Islamic prison gangs would spark a revolution It read: “I’ve always said I’d sacrice my le tomorrowit would end the Islamic takeover of our beautul land.”  Nick Lowles, chief executive of HOPE not Hate, said the activity showed he was utterly unfit to be an MP. In a statement, Mr McCartney said: I apologise unreservedly. In no way do I endorse the tweets or the accounts behind them. I accept retweeting them was ill judged and could cause offence. This isive figure [Mr Robinson] has no place in our politics or public le. Anthony BrowneAnthony Browne, an ex-aide to Boris Johnson , blamed migrants for bringing germs to UK and for the spread of HIV. Labour called on Tories to boot out Mr Browne after the articles were unearthed by.Writing for the Spectator, he said: “It is not through letting in terrorists that the governmentaposs policy of mass migration – especially from the third world – will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs.” Mr Browne, who worked for the PM when he was Mayor of London, has apologised for the comments in the past.  Speaking when appointed Mr Johnsonaposs policy chief at City Hall he said: “I do very much regret any offence caused by any past newspaper articles. It really never was my intention to cause offence but to provoke debate. The articles, which I deeply regret writing, also don’t give a fair reflection of my views. I want to make clear that I am emphatically not anti-immigration.” During the campaign, a Conservative party spokesperson said: “These comments were made over  years ago, Anthony Browne has apologised for these comments and sincerely regrets them.” Lee Anderson Tory Lee Anderson said nuisance council house tenants should live in tents and work in fields In a shocking video rant on Facebook, the Tory MP for Ashfield said he thinks they should be plucked from their homes and made to pick potatoes for  hours a day. During the campaign, he was caught getting his friend to act as a aposswing voterapos in another disinformation scandal to hit the Conservative party.  In the video posted during the campaign, he said: These people who have to live somewhere, letaposs have them in a tent, in the middle of a field. Six oaposclock every morning, letaposs have them up, letaposs have them in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six oaposclock, same again the next day. That would be my solution. Mr Anderson took the constituency of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire from Labour with , votes. Sally-Ann Hart Sally-Ann Hart sparked outrage when she appeared to suggest people with learning dficulties could work for less than the minimum wage. Ms Hartaposs opinion, which comes from a piece she wrote for the Spectator in , was branded outdated and inexcusable by disability campaigners, The Tory, who replaced Amber Rudd Hastings and Rye, is also facing two-party investigations over alleged Islamophobia and anti-Semitism - but Prime Minister Boris Johnson opted not to suspend her.

Official figures - slipped out hours after the election result on Friday - show % of all those who have moved from old system DLA to Personal Independence Paymentslost out financially. Some , former DLA claimants had payments stopped altogether since PIP launched in . A further , had payments decreased. Meanwhile , people had their award unchanged and , saw it rise after moving from DLA to PIP. It comes after years of complaints about the privatised assessment system - which is overruled in almost three quarters of appeals. The figures were highlighted by journalist and campaigner Alex Tfin yesterday and prompted a storm from charities today. Geoff Firmister of the Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than  groups, said: These figures are very worrying and we suspect many of the decisions are wrong. We would urge the new Government both to commission research to determine the extent of incorrect decisions and step up its efforts to get things right in the first place. The criteria for PIP should also be reviewed, in full consultation with disabled people. These are often le-changing amounts of money being withdrawn from people with disabilities and long-term health conditions. MS Society spokeswoman Georgina Carr said , people live with multiple sclerosis and the PIP process is failing many of them at every stage. She added: “Over the course of the election more than , of us called on the new PM to fix PIP once and for all.  The fact nearly half of those relying on the benefit have had their award reduced or stopped when moving from DLA to PIP shows just how desperately this needs to happen. We need a system that recognises what le with a fluctuating condition is like, without arbitrary and unfair measures like the PIP m rule, and we need it soon. People with MS can’t wait any longer.” James Taylor of disability equality charity Scope said the figures were extremely worrying. He added: “Consistently high levels of PIP decisions are being overturned, which demonstrates the assessment is not fit for purpose. The change from DLA to PIP has hit hundreds of thousands of people with physical and mental disabilities across the UK. The worst-hit were people with psychosis, , of whom either failed a PIP assessment entirely or had their money cut since . By comparison, , saw their payment rise. Some , arthritis sufferers had their PIP cut or stopped when they moved from DLA - while , saw it go up. Epilepsy sufferers were also badly hit, with , losing some or all of their benefits compared to , who received more. And , people with MS, , with AIDS and  with cystic fibrosis saw their money either cut or stopped. Since , even  double amputees have had their money cut when moving from DLA to PIP - while  saw their award go up. Some groups were better off on average. , blind people saw payments cut or stopped but , saw them rise. Likewise , people with learning dficulties lost out but , were better off. These figures only relate to claimants who were already on the old DLA system when they claimed PIP. And they do not include people who lost their benefits before an assessment, failed to attend an appointment, or withdrew their claim. In total, of the .million DLA claimants reassessed by October , ,had their benefit cut, ,had it stopped after an assessment, ,had it stopped before assessment and ,withdrew their claim. ,saw their award rise and ,had it unchanged. “The new government urgently needs to set out how it will overhaul the PIP assessment to make sure it works for disabled people, not against them.” Marc Francis of the welfare advice charity ZK Trust added: These statistics lay bare the devastating impact of aposwelfare reformapos on hundreds of thousands of disabled people. The new Government must make it an absolute priority to reform the discredited assessment processes for both PIP and ESA. Meanwhile Mind slammed separate figures which showed , people with mental health problems saw their disability benefits stopped between June  and October .

The leader is expected to be bombarded with questions from backbenchers in the Commons after their worst election result since . Mr Corbyn, who will quit early next year, has been heavily criticised since the election. Party leadership hopefuls including favourite Rebecca Long- Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner were among mourners at the funeral of party grandee Frank Dobson today. Meanwhile, a close ally of Mr Corbyn has blamed the BBC for fuelling Labour ’s crushing defeat. Shadow Transport Secretary, Andy McDonald, launched a furious broadside at the broadcaster, accusing it of playing a role in Labour’s hammering. In a tense exchange with Radio  Today programme host Justin Webb, the frontbencher said: “I’m worried about our public service broadcaster.” Webb asked: “Are you saying that the BBC was in part responsible for Mr Corbyn’s loss ” Mr McDonald replied: “I am saying that they played a part. I’m going to look at us. We’re the important part here, we got this wrong. “Butthe BBC are going to hold themselves out as somehow having conducted themselves in an impartial manner, I think they’ve really got to have a look in the mirror.” London Mayor Sadiq Khan appeared to rule himself out of the leadership race by concentrating on winning a second term in the capital. He encouraged the next leader to be reflective about last week’s defeat at the polls, saying: “I don’t believe in heroic failure, we don’t improve anybody’s lives by losing elections.” Labour’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, has reportedly recommended the contest starts on January , with the view of having a new leader in place by the end of March.

Outspoken Corbyn critic Jess Phillips also broke cover today with an article saying a New Labour approach would be delusional but the party must be brave to reconnect with working-class voters. It means Labour could finally choose its first female leader in a race expected to kick off after Christmas and finish before Easter.Apart from Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer most of the leading possible contenders are female, including Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner and Corbyn alliesapos choice Rebecca Long-Bailey.Ms Nandy said Labour must regain its status as a coalition for both Lewisham and Leigh and bring Labour home to those who voted Tory. She also said she may vote for Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal this week -he allows scrutiny on a customs union at its committee stage in January.She told BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: The reason I’m thinking about it is because we’ve just had the most shattering defeat where you really felt in towns like mine that the earth was quaking. And we’ve watched the entire Labour base just crumble beneath our feet. The winner will rest heavily on who Labouraposs ,-strong, left-leaning membership, which more than doubled since Jeremy Corbyn ran for leader, swing behind.  Labour centrists are already urging those who share their values to sign up to membership of the party to get a vote. That means the freeze date - the cut-off for how long-standing members have to be to get a vote - could be crucial. In , Labouraposs ruling NEC tried to block anyone whoaposd joined more recently than in  months from voting. But the decision was overturned by Court of Appeal, something the new NEC - now dominated by the left - will have to consider. Some left-wing figures are already circling around Rebecca Long-Bailey, with Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon privately putting himself forward as a candidate for deputy.  A source played down talk of a joint ticket but said: Richard wants to see Rebecca as the next Labour leader. That could see the Shadow Business Secretary running against her flatmate Angela Rayner for the top job. One party figure said: The real question is whether Angela and Beccyaposs friendship is strong enough to withhold the external pressure. A Corbyn loyalist described Ms Long-Bailey as the leftaposs only hope - but admitted they werenapost over-enthusiastic about Mr Burgon. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey could be a brilliant leader before praising shadow cabinet ministers Angela Rayner, Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler.  Another Labour source predicted the race will be a very crowded field, at least at first. Ms Nandy, who has campaigned for left-behind towns, today called for Labouraposs headquarters to move out of London in order to reconnect the party with voters outside of the capital. We should move our party conferences back to towns as well as cities, she added.She claimed it was undoubtedly true that Jeremy Corbyn is to blame for the devastating defeat after Labour won  seats in the general election , its worst showing since ."},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan rules himself out","story":"NewsSadiq Khan rules himself out of Labour leadership and has advice for hopefulsThe London Mayor wont be a contender to replace Jeremy Corbyn but warned candidates that claimed to explain why Labour lost straight away would lose \"credibility\"ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC News \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

David Browne was climbing aboard the bus home from his family in Dublin to Navan in Ireland when the driver stopped him. He told the self-employed IT consultant that he was not allowed on because he was intoxicated. “I hadn’t even got to the top of the steps when the bus driver said I was too drunk to get on, Mr Browne explained. I was flummoxed. I actually ended up speechless. “I have cerebral palsy and have bad balance but that was the only thing that may have led to the confusion. “I tried to correct him but it was only when other passengers intervened and told the bus driver that I was clearly disabled, that he let me on. But there was no apology or any kind of regret. “Even when I was getting off the bus in Navan, he just turned his back to me. He made no attempt to apologise despite a suggestion by another passenger. “I was left mortied and embarrassed but it was the lack of apology that made it worse. His arrogance was putrid and frankly horrible. “I travel this route several times a week and many of the drivers know me by name and have the craic. After he complained about the incident operators Bus Éireann offered an apology. “We were most disappointed to note your experiences while availing of our service, an email from the company read. “We are very conscious of the need to treat all passengers with due care and courtesy at all times. “The lack of courtesy afforded to you and indeed the general behaviour of the driver in question is totally unacceptable. “The driver concerned has now been identied and arrangements have been made to interview this driver in relation to this incident and I would like to assure you that suitable corrective steps will be taken in order to prevent a recurrence of this nature in the future. “On behalf of Bus Éireann, please accept my sincere apologies for any distress caused to you on this occasion.” Mr Browne said that the apology feels more like a ‘copy and paste exercise’ and wants to know what has been done,anything. “I am extremely disappointed with the responses I have received on this matter, he said. In my opinion it goes far beyond a bog standard reply of apology, which is one that is more suited to a customer who would be complaining about a late bus, During and following this incident I suffered needless embarrassment and humiliation due to lack of disability awareness. I would like to know more about the actions that have been put in place to ensure I never have to face this scenario again. I feel that I at least deserve a phone call to know that things are actually being done from the person doing it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad 8 who won nearly","story":"NewsDad-of- who won nearly £million on online slot machine can still claim benefitsThomas Roche, , pocketed £.million in October after spending £ playing Bets Reel King Slot machine during his first ever go - but say his family will still receive some of their benefitsShareCommentsByHenry GoodwinOlive Loveridge-GreeneAbigail OLeary:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThomas and Shelley Roche splashed out on a luxury new home with land and stables \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The pair were astonished to discover they will still get child benefit, child tax credits and disability living allowance for some of their children, they said. Shelley, who grew up in Woolwich and does not work, said: “It’s tax-free money. We rang HMRC, we rang all the benefit offices. The only thing which did stop is income support. “Obviously it’s child benefit and child tax credit, so it’s for the kids. So we told them the percentage we get from the bank, and we still get that. “I tried to stop it, but they said it’s for your children. They said you don’t have to stop child tax credit because it’s for the children. “It’s not an income for me and Dad - income support is for me and him. Child tax credit and benefit is for the children. “My housing benefit has stopped. We’re doing everything right and above board. They have already splurged some of their winnings on a six-bed pad in Kent with stables and acres of land, and are preparing to leave their three-bed council house next week. Thomas, from Eltham, has also bought five cars - some for family - and a quad bike to drive at his new home, he said. The dad, who refused to say how much he was getting in benefits now, said: “I spent £ online on Bet and won just under four million. “We were new to the slots. It was about :am in the morning we got on there, obviously we had kids to sort and stuff. Next minute you know, we’ve become millionaires. “I think we woke the whole neighbourhood. It was unreal - you don’t expect to win that, just under four million quid. “It means a lot, yeah. I’ve got eight kids, we still get to keep our benefits - other than income support.  “I’ve barred myself from going back on Bet already - I’d rather go and spend my money. “I called my bank to check whether the money had gone in, and while I was talking to them the money started flowing in. “In the space of five minutes while I was in the bank, all the money was there. “We’ve never had a new car - we’ve always had a Beetle. I only do the school run with it, shopping and take it once a year to a VW festival. “But since winning, I’ve gone out and bought a van and cars for me and my brother, one for my sister. I’ve bought five cars. “I bought a house, bought myself a Raptor - a road legal quad bike. I’ve got nowhere to store it, so that’s in the back of the van. “We’re going to de-clutter this house and give it back to the council. Then I’m going to invest money into buying houses and renting them back to the council, and then just look for any investments to bring money in.  “It came in as a bonus. At first it said we were only going to get £, and then I went to the toilet and came back and it was rolling in slowly as the jackpot - it said ‘Jackpot King’. “We had never won anything on it before. It happened in October, and within two weeks we’d bought our house. We’re going to sign paperwork for it tomorrow. Thomas, who has five girls and three boys, said one of his children has ADHD, one has autism and another has hyperactivity disorder. “This is obviously big news, someone on benefits - from Eltham - to be a multimillionaire, he said. “What’s next for us  To move into our house, declutter this house and buy other houses.”  Thomas, a former traveller, added: “After the money was in my account I came home and phoned HMRC, because I didn’t want to spend the money in case I got in trouble for it. “Obviously being on benefits and having this sort of money, we thought we would get in trouble. “We rung them up and they said we didn’t have to worry about anything because it’s tax-free cash. “The only thing we’ll lose is the income support, but we still get to keep childcare stuff. “Monthly I would say we were taking in just under £,-a-month, what with having kids with special needs. “We still get the kids’ disability allowances. I think we get higher-rate care, but low-rate mobility, and that’s for all three of them.” The couple had their first child when they were both , and their youngest is just seven-months-old.

The tiny newborns were born almost four months premature and in a cruel twist of fate were both suffering from an extremely care condition which left them unable to swallow. The fragile pair spent a gruelling six hours in undergoing surgery at the Royal Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital. Their condition meant both could have choked to death or caught pneumonia. Little Evie almost didnapost make it. She had to be brought back to le several times by staff at the intensive care unitat Saint Maryaposs Hospital, London and she endured ten weeks on a ventilator. But thanks to the incredible NHS staff, April will go up with her twin sister by her side and the pair will spend their first Christmas at home in Reading with parents Lindsay Rhodes and Stephen Hardiker at their home in Burnley.Lindsay told M.E.N : “The work that is carried out between the teams across both hospitals in amazing, and the nurses and surgical teams are incredible.I cannot thank them enough for their ongoing care and compassion throughout one of the most dficult times for us. They never gave up hope and the girls are now our little miracles.  The whole team on NICU were just amazing and never gave up hope for Evie, which is what we needed. We nearly lost her on a few occasions and she was resuscitated more times than we like to remember but she pulled through and we are so proud of them both. The condition, known as Oesophageal Atresiawith Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula , affects around  in , newborns. Not only is it rare for twins to both be affected by this non-genetic defect, April and Evie were the most premature babies to have been treated for the condition at the hospitals.  The girls were born at Burnley General Hospital after mum Lindsay Rhodes went into labour without realising at  weeks. The twins were transferred to the NICU at Saint Maryaposs to receive specialist treatment. The defect meant that the twins wouldnapost be able to swallow because the oesophagus, the tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach, wasnapost connected. Consultant surgeons David Wilkinson and Nick Lansdale operated on one tiny baby each, fitting gastrostomies so they could be fed via a tube directly into their stomachs.  April and Evie were given round the clock care on the intensive care unit before undergoing more major corrective surgery to enable them to feed normally. Nick Lansdale, Consultant Neonatal Surgeon at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital said: “Oesophageal Atresia affecting both twins is extremely rare. April and Evie’s surgery was made challenging by their tiny size at birth, with each twin’s oesophagus being approximately the diameter of a piece of spaghetti.  While April recovered quickly from surgery, Evieaposs battle was far from over. After more than six hours in theatre, she became critically ill and almost died. The fragile youngster spent ten weeks on a ventilator and was resuscitated many times by expert staff on NICU. Thanks to intensive nursing care, little Evie pulled through and will spend her first Christmas with her twin sister with their parents Lindsay and Stephen at their home in Burnley.  Lindsay and Stephen lived on the hospital site at Ronald McDonald House while the twins were cared for at the hospital. April joined her mum and dad at Ronald McDonald House in June and Evie was discharged in July. The couple added: To all of the nurses, doctors, surgeons and anaesthetists that have helped us through this year, I cannot thank you enough for your support that you have provided us. Even when we visit now for check-ups, we feel so welcome and the staff within the hospital make us feel like family.  I don’t know how we would have got through this challenging time without you all.

Bartosz Konopacki, , attacked the -year-old sex worker after driving around searching for a woman to attack after he was dumped. After spotting the victim, he parked his car and approached her before kning her repeatedly in an alleyway. The woman was stabbed four times in the chest, once in the neck and head and left for dead in Hillfields, Coventry, at .am on May . Incredibly, she only survived when a police officer pushed his fingers into the neck wound to stop her bleeding out. Graphic photographs of the womanaposs injuries show deep slash wounds on her face. Despite her horric injuries, the woman managed to remember some of Konopackiaposs car registration plate which helped nail him two days later. Giving evidence at his trial, the victim said: I turn round and all I see is him with a big long kne. Iaposm cornered. It happened so quick, and so slow. Heaposs stabbing me in my heart and my neck, and there was blood spitting out everywhere. He didnapost want business. He was out to kill that night. He just pulled the kne straight out.

She added: I seen him drive past as Iaposm struggling for my le on the street. He stopped and was just watching. Michelle Heeley QC, prosecuting, said: It was only because a police officer struck his fingers into one of the wounds that meant she was able to receive treatment for her injuries. Konopacki fled the scene but left the distinctive orange-bladed kne and a glove behind but despite DNA being recovered, detectives were unable to find a match because he was not on the police database. CCTV showed factory worker Konopacki making off in a light coloured BMW but officers were only able to obtain a partial number plate from the footage available. This information, combined with the victimaposs statement helped identy his car which was spotted two days later by an off-duty police officer who saw it abandoned in a care home car park on May . The car was registered to Konopacki at an address in Wood End where he was later arrested. A search of the home revealed a kitchen kne block with one kne missing. DNA from the distinctive orange kne and glove was then matched to Konopacki and his victim picked him out during an ID parade.Last month he was found guilty of attempted murder and todaywas jailed for  years at Warwick Crown Court. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Kelly Mills, from West Midlands Police Force CID, said: This was a savage attack on a woman we understand Konopacki had never met before.

But she became fed up of being the fat mum at the school gates and decided to fight the flab. Since then, the mother-of-five has dropped six dress sizes and now tips the scales at st lb. Recalling previous Christmases, Susanne said: I’d start getting tubs of Roses and Heroes in mid-September to make sure I had all the treats sorted for me and the family, but I’d buy two tubs a week and eat them all to myself. I’d tell everyone friends or family had called round so I’d opened them to offer round – and I’d have to get some more for us. But the same would happen again... and again. I’d even buy Quality Street because I didn’t really like them much – and I scoffed them too. But Susanne, who is from Huyton, Merseyside, joined Slimming World this year to aid her weight loss journey. She said she began gaining weight at college and a physical assault on a night out in her late teens worsened the issue. I was  and I’d gone for a night out with friends when I was attacked. From then on,I’m honest, although I had counselling to help me deal with it, I blocked most of it out and started comfort eating, Susanne added.  I went to Ibiza one year a size , and went back the following year a size . And I hadn’t even realised I had put weight on. It was as though I’d gone to bed one size and woken up bigger. Before I knew it, I was a size  and I weighed st lb.  I can’t physically remember the weight creeping on and no one pulled me up and said aposdo you know you’re getting bigger and biggerapos  If only they had. But Susanne is now a consultant for Slimming World. Sheaposs ditched her McDonald’s breakfasts, fattening snacks and sugary energy drinks for home-cooked meals and healthy treats.  For lunch, I’d have a sandwich with anything on white bread, followed by more crisps, another chocolate bar and a Red Bull.Then going home on the bus I’d have more crisps and chocolate,only to relieve the boredom of the journey, the mum said. At Christmas it just got even worse. I’d plough through the Pringles, and buy packs of party food like cocktails sausages, sausage rolls and pork pies, the ones with a dozen in.

Christmas with the family and both Yuletide and New Year celebrations aside, the next highlight on the calendar is July st - when we can expect to see aposperfectapos conditions. The worst weather day of the year was revealed after an extensive study was conducted to find out when Brits across the country are guaranteed to get the best weather conditions. In London, July th was named the day when the best weather is most likely to greet the capital. Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle will all be blessed with the best weather the day before, on the rd. And Brighton and Hove will follow London the day after on the th July. A spokesperson for Andrews Sykes Heater Hire, which commissioned the research with DTN, a global provider of independent weather insights, said: Complaining about the weather is part of our national identity. So we thought it would be interesting to flip the conversation on its head and see once and for all when the nation is most likely to be content with their lot. DTNaposs massive data set of legacy weather data allowed us to pinpoint these days in some of the UKaposs major cities - days which we hope Brits are marking in their calendars as some sure-fire good weather days.  To calculate the dates when ideal weather was most likely to occur, a study of , Brits was conducted to uncover the temperature and weather conditions they consider to be the most comfortable. These optimum conditions were then compared against weather forecasts in each city over the last  years to find out when they were most likely to occur. This score considered measured weather conditions such as temperature, rainfall, windspeed and cloud cover. Of the cities highlighted in the study, Edinburgh and Glasgow preferred their weather coolest, choosing  degrees Celsius as their ideal temperature.  Residents of Southampton and London like things to be warmer, opting for a reading of  degrees Celsius on the thermostat on their perfect weather day. It also emerged the average Brit will talk about the weather four times a day. A third use the topic to break the ice with a stranger and one in five find meteorological discussions genuinely interesting. And  per cent of those surveyed believe they speak about the weather simply because apositaposs the British thing to doapos. The study also found  per cent of Brits are most likely to mention the weather in a positive way when it is sunny, while rain is most likely to earn our ire. In fact, the ideal weather preferred by Brits consists of a light breeze and mild temperatures of  degrees Celsius.

Buyers have been scared off by the  tombstones in the garden of the converted Methodist church. The newly-renovated, three-bedroom property has never been lived in. Selling agents Bedfords have failed to flog it for more than  months. They have dropped the price of the Grade II listed property from £, - in April  when it first went on the market - to £,. Yet despite the massive discount, Bedfords are still struggling to attract buyers at the spooky mansion. Partner Emmerson Dutton maintains that anyone who can look beyond the tombstones will be getting a bargain. He said: “It’s such a nice house, they have done an amazing job on it. “We have dropped the price on a number of occasions, for the money you will not find a better building. “But the graves are the problem, rightly or wrongly. “It wouldn’t bother me, but it clearly does many others.” He joked: “They’re usually a quiet bunch.” Mr Dutton explained that many prospective buyers said they would not discuss the house because of the tombs. “If someone does have the inclination to look at it, regardless of the graves, they will get a really good value house,” he said. The agent said he hoped to finally flog the property in the new year. “Market conditions haven’t been ideal, but the graves keep coming up as the main problem,” Mr Dutton added. “I think come the new year, someone will discover it and see a beautully renovated chapel conversion.” The former church resides in the picturesque Norfolk village of North Lopham. The chapel was built in , but went out of service five years ago as the congregation dwindled. It has since been converted to a modern family home, but the original buyers never moved in.  Buyers can’t remove the tombstones as they are owned by the Church of England for another  years. The main door of the property has been moved to round the back of half-an-acre site, with a spacious garden. The driveway is to the right of the house, so occupants would rarely have to look at the spooky tombstones out front. The house has three bedrooms and a modern open plan kitchen. As well as prospective buyers, ghost hunters have to come to look at the graves. One group wanted to bring their tuning fork to trace the spirits. Many of the inscriptions on the graves are still visible. There are  headstones still standing in the garden, with  leant against the building.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShanie Ryan, Capital Xtra and QVC presenter, found herself caught up in one of London’s worst ever terrorist attacks  years ago – the   bombings, which saw  people killed and  injured. Shanie, who was  in July , had been travelling to her dance graduation and in a split-second decision that was to potentially save her le, she had got off the underground train’s first carriage at King’s Cross to say goodbye to her flatmate, Leon, before jumping back into the second carriage. One of the bombers had stepped into that first carriage as she stepped off and minutes later a bomb exploded. “I thought there had been a terrible crash,” she recalls. “I managed to escape from all the debris and get out of the underground. I was met by medics who tried to put me in an ambulance but all I wanted to do was escape so I did a runner. I’d perforated my eardrum and I had lung damage, but I just ran and ran to college. “When I got there, everyone looked at me asI had crawled out of a war zone. I was covered head-to-toe in soot and I had charcoal in my eyes. It was then someone broke the news it was a terrorist attack. I was traumatised.” Shanie eventually managed to get home and spent the next seven days glued to the TV screen. “I was obsessed with watching the news to try to find out what had happened to help clear my head until my mum told me to stop because she could see it wasn’t doing me any good,” she says. “In the weeks that followed, I tried to resume my le as best as I could but it was very much a blur.” Soon after, Shanie was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and while she received therapy for a short time, it was too soon and she says it took her over a year to feel herself again.  Despite being determined to get on with rebuilding her le, Shanie started to notice some dferent symptoms emerging other than the more common ones suffered by those with PTSD, such as feeling depressed and anxious in crowded spaces. “I have always had a brilliant and exceptional memory,” she explains. “As a child, I was constantly learning scripts and my memory was a very strong muscle. But as time passed by after that awful day, I started to notice that I couldn’t remember things. It would be weird moments where, for example, someone would start talking about our school friends and I wouldn’t have a clue who they were even though we had grown up together. No amount of ­anecdotes could trigger my mind unless something silly like an outfit they always wore was pointed out, then I would slowly start to recall them. “It often left me feeling overwhelmed but for a long time, I didn’t question it.”  The turning point came three years ago when a friend came up to Shanie and started recalling their college prom. “He started talking about something that had happened that night. It was a big deal at the time but I had absolutely no clue what he was talking about. He mentioned someone called Amelia and I replied: ‘who the hell is Amelia ’ “He looked at me asI were crazy and said: ‘please tell me you are kidding me – she was your flatmate for two years’. Even then, I still couldn’t remember who she was. “Eventually after thinking I was crazy for not knowing, he reminded me she dated a man with a skinhead and it was only then that I started to remember her. “Even though I had ­eventually remembered who Amelia was, I felt like I had lost my mind. I felt it was so weird that somebody who had an excellent memory could not remember someone they lived with – she had been my last ­flatmate before Leon moved in, so it wasn’t ancient history.” Determined to get to the bottom of her memory loss, Shanie, who presents her own podcast series called Influence Me with social-media influencers, tackling issues like mental health, body image and entrepreneurism, started listening to medical podcasts.  “One doctor explained a lot of ­important developments in a woman’s brain take place between the ages of  and  when the frontal lobe develops. “I discovered any impact on the brain’s development can manest itself in dferent ways including the loss of memory. While my brain has attempted to protect me from memories of the attack, it has also erased other ­memories in the process. It does not pick or choose which parts it protects.” She says she felt relieved to have finally discovered why she was having dficulty remembering events, including her own st birthday party. “Thank goodness I have photos,” she laughs. “If it weren’t for those, I wouldn’t be able to remember which bar I held the party in, what I wore, nor who attended it. What should be a ­momentous landmark is one I now always forget. Likewise,I haven’t met someone for a long time, I will have dficulty in recalling who they are.” Interestingly, the memory loss only affects long-term events. Shanie, who lives in Croydon with her partner, Tony, adds: “I am a presenter for Capital Xtra and can remember my scripts word perfect. Luckily Tony understands why I can’t remember some things.” Time – and therapy – have been a great healer for Shanie.

They said Edita is lucky to be alive. I am so grateful for the support everyone has given us in the last few days.  Two men have been charged in connection with the incident.

I had to tell them three times that a sofa had fallen on top of her because they found it so hard to believe. People were bringing her blankets and we moved the bins from the rear yard so the ambulance could get in easily. Staff from Pure clothes shop - next door to Nailco - also helped Edita.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that. I can only work as hard as possible and I’m sure it will come together again and I can get back to how I was playing last season and enjoying things again.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.40382176-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.40382176-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.40382176-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.40382176-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"in pictures ho ho whole lotta fun to be had in the ferry for santa sunday","story":"Broughty Ferry families lapped up all the festive fun of Santa Sunday.They braved bitterly cold conditions to visit a iety of stalls in the town, which offered a host of Christmas items and snacks.Cartoon characters in fancy dress, including Frozen  favourites Elsa and Olaf, were on hand to meet and greet the children throughout the day.And also making an appearance was film character the Grinch who tried, but failed to put a dampener on the occasion.A funfair with bumper cars and rides also proved a winner.And topping off the day was Santa’s Grotto where children lined up to ask for their special presents list to be delivered on the big day."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c9395086ee127.15107893-846x564.jpg ","title":"mcmullan returns for arbroath clash","story":"Dundee United are set to welcome Paul McMullan back to the fold for tomorrow’s trip to Arbroath.The winger sat out Tuesday night’s - win at Morton with a groin strain picked up in the previous match against Alloa.However, the -year-old is expected to be fit for the Gayfield clash as United aim to pick up their eighth win in a row and stretch their -point lead at the top of the Championship.Terrors boss Robbie Neilson said: “He’ll be fine, he did a bit of training yesterday and we’re hopeful he’ll do full training today.“He had a problem in the game against Alloa but managed to get through the match.“We hoped it would settle down because it’s something he had a month or two ago as well.“He’ll be ready for tomorrow.”Robbie also gave an update on Peter Pawlettand Cammy Smithwith the former set to miss out once again.He added: “Peter’s going to be another couple of weeks.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do - and oh, how they took it.CastFlora - Rachel FalconerBelladonna - Amy WelshBelle - Aimee RichardsonWhitney - Tracy BorthwickBritney - Emma WilsonMarcel - Stuart MitchellMonique - Amanda BlacklockGustave -

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It was a massive punch in the gut for Labourrsquos youthful idealists in their Twitter bubble, who canrsquot understand why working-class people would vote for anEton-educated Tory.In Scotland, they didnrsquot. The SNP surprised itself by almost repeating the tsunami SNP surge of . An astonishing achievement for Nicola Sturgeon and confirmation that Scotland and England are growing further apart faster.When Boris Johnson hailed a victory for ldquoone nation Conservatism, he inadvertently spoke the truth. It did apply in only one nation: England. Scotland is now, in a very real sense, another country. There may not be a referendum next year ndash Boris Johnsonrsquos crushing majority in Westminster will see to that. But something will have to give.Resurgent Scottish nationalism, and the most unionist Prime Minister in Westminster since Margaret Thatcher, is an unstable and potentially explosive combination. Everything and anything is now possible, including a court battle over a Scottish referendum. Nicola Sturgeon is demanding that Holyrood gets the power to call referendums. That wonrsquot happen.But donrsquot be surprisedBoris Johnson makes a blue-sky offer of federalism hersquos supported it in the past. As the UK leaves the European Union ndash the one certainty after Thursday ndash Johnson will try to do a side deal with Scotland, as he did with the DUP. Just donrsquot expect it to be all that it seems.Hopes that a hung parliament would deliver a Scottish independence referendum, with the SNP striking a deal with Labour, died on Thursday night. It was curtains too for the Corbyn project. Though there will likely be a continuing civil war in the Labour Party over the succession. Shades again of the s.The first General Election I covered was , so there was a distinct sense of having been through this movie before. Indeed, I wrote in this paper only three weeks ago that Labourrsquos manesto might end up as another ldquolongest suicide note in history. That was how Labourrsquos  effort was famously described by the Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Some left-wing folk said it was somehow morally wrong to criticise that document, with its intergalactic spending plans improbably financed by a % tax hike on people earning over pound,. Imperviousness to constructive criticism has been one of the hallmarks of Corbynism. Labour chose to listen to the hyperventilating keyboard warriors on Twitter who attack anyone deviating from the line as a ldquoTory shill.Yet, it should have been clear to everyone that there was something deeply suspect about Labourrsquos multiple manesto giveaways. The % pay hike for public-sector workers, free broadband, cheap rail fares, the four-day week, the belated bung of pound billion to the Waspi women. This wasnrsquot social democracy, it was retail politics gone mad. It culminated in Labourrsquos promise that every family would be pound, better off. People just arenrsquot that stupid.If Labour had confined itself to a few well-defined and credible offers on health spending, tuition fees and rail nationalisation, it might have worked. Thatrsquos what the Tories did, with their simple message of new hospitals and more nurses. However, the manesto was only part of Labourrsquos problem. Corbyn was also sunk by his policy, or lack of it, on Brexit.How Labour thought that they could win with their leader pretending to have no view on the biggest issue facing the country in half a century defies belief. Again, s of the galaxy on social media insisted that ldquohersquos just being an honest broker ... keeping options open ... uniting the country. Nonsense. It was an irresponsible abdication of leadership. Labourrsquos policy on Brexit was as dishonest as it was cynical. Dishonest: because everyone knew that Jeremy Corbyn was a lelong opponent of the European Union. Cynical: because Labourrsquos metropolitan Remainers hoped ldquoconstructive ambiguity would fool provincial Brexit voters into believing that Corbyn really would renegotiate a better Brexit deal in three months.No-one bought it. The Labour leaderrsquos inability to say who would actually lead his Brexit negotiation, still less campaign for it, was one of the many face-palm moments in a campaign that left my face and palm red raw. Blaming BBC bias only made it worse.Of course, Corbynrsquos personality and style of politics was also aturn-off, and the press made a lot of his past associations with IRA supporters and Hamas. But theyrsquod tried that unsuccessfully in . This time, the Labour leader somehow managed to be even more unpopular in Scotland than his bumptious Etonian Tory rival. How could that possibly be  Hadnrsquot John McDonnell all but promised a second independence referendum  Arenrsquot Scottish voters supposed to be more left-wing The aversion to Corbyn was mostly down to the national question. But I suspect many Scots shared with Labour voters in England an aversion to Corbynrsquos particular brand of London Labour politics. His sympathy, however justied, with the Palestinian cause, obscure LGBTQIA+ demands and, of course, his views on immigration and defence. It left many patriotic provincial voters uncomfortable.This doesnrsquot mean that socially conservative Labour voters are all homophobes and racists. Polls repeatedly confirm that the vast majority of English, and Scots, voters harbour no ill will towards gay people or racial minorities. But they arenrsquot exactly passionate about transgender toilet arrangements or uncontrolled immigration. And millions voted for BrexitThinly-disguised contempt for working-class Brexit voters was evident throughout the campaign. Labour-friendly comedians like Steve Coogan and Nish Kumar condemned them as ldquoignorant and racist. Did they think they werenrsquot listening Labour activists on Twitter talked about the ldquowhite working class astheyrsquore a lumpen mass of unaddressed bigotry. The Corbynite intellectual, Paul Mason, called the election ldquoa victory of the old over the young, racists over people of colour, selfishness over the planet. Not perhaps the best way to attract back core Labour voters in Blyth, Bolsover, Sedgefield.What middle-class intellectuals failed to understand is that, in post-crash Britain, the politics of nation has largely eclipsed the politics of class. The election results north and south of the Border may appear wildly dferent, but they are both expressions of populist nationalism.Brexit is essentially English nationalism. It is a revolt by people the writer David Goodhart calls the ldquosomewheres, in the provinces, against the remain-voting elites, or ldquoanywheres, in urban centres. ldquoSomewheres feel left out by globalisation, as their jobs have gone abroad and mass immigration has altered their communities.Tories since Disraeli have understood the potency of national identity as a unying force. People who lack the mobility conferred by a university education tend to love their country. They have little  to hold on to in an age of insecurity and rapid change. Get Brexit Done was an English version of Make America Great Again.And though the politics are dferent, Brexit is not so far removed from what happened in Scotland during and after the financial crash. In , the Scottish working classes in the housing estates and inner cities entered politics in unprecedented numbers to vote for independence. The Yes campaign was inspired by feelings of national identity, community and Scotsrsquo love of their country. Plus the hope that an independent Scottish Government would look after them better than remote Westminster.It may be naiumlve, it may be nationalistic, it certainly is populist. But identity is a powerful political mobiliser in an age of insecurity and mistrust. People want to belong, to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. National identity gives them that.But the problem with nationalism is that tends to be exclusive. Scotland and England are expressing identity in dferent and contradictory ways ndash the former in a spirit of pro-European internationalism the latter in a more inward-looking, nativist anti-Europeanism. These are irreconcilable opposites.Nicola Sturgeon has often said that she would like to drop the word ldquonational from the SNPrsquos name. She clearly feels uncomfortable with the politics of nationalism, despite having been an SNP supporter all her le. And she has good reason to be wary, given the behaviour of some European nationalist parties.Her task now will be to contain the fervour of her triumphant party and constructively channel their hatred of English conservatism. It wonrsquot be easy. Boris Johnson has provoked the Scots by ruling out any referendum for at least five years. Scotland is about to be dragged kicking and screaming out of Europe.Sturgeon is a cautious politician, unlike her predecessor Alex Salmond, and will not tolerate civil disobedience or unconstitutional behaviour.But like it or not, she has a fight on her hands.

The first possibility, he says ldquois that when it comes to Johnson and his principles there is , to borrow from Gertrude Stein, simply no lsquotherersquo there. According to this take the prime minister is no more and no less than an amalgam of ambition and ego.But Bale concludes that the Prime Minister is no more than a ldquobog standard British right winger, who appreciates intuitively how to appeal to British voters and their sense of their country. As a result, he does not think Mr Johnson is sincere. ldquoEach and every one of the prime ministerrsquos predecessors, remember, made similarly heartwarming speeches on the steps of No  about healing a ided country, only to walk through its shiny black door and proceed to do pretty much the opposite.Elsewhere there is even less sign of rts healing.

Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence.

It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly..

By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-mps-set-commons-showdown-corbyn-catastrophic-election-performance","story":"As the dust began to settle on the Oppositionrsquos worst General Election performance since , which saw its so-called ldquored wall of seats in the Midlands and northern England crumble to a Tory surge, John McDonnell insisted: ldquoI own this disaster.The Shadow Chancellor, who over the weekend announced he would step back from the frontbench, said: ldquoIf anyones to blame, its me, full stop.However, he also cited Brexit and particularly the right-wing media for having \"demonised\" Jeremy Corbyn relentlessly ahead of the partyrsquos dismal defeat.The party leader has suggested he would stay in his role for several weeks until Labourrsquos ruling National Executive Committee sorted out a new leadership contest but Lord McNicol, the partyrsquos former General Secretary, insisted: ldquoJeremy should stand down now and we should move to a caretaker leader.\"Go to one of the grandees from before like Harriet Harman or Hilary Benn or Yvette Cooper, bring in someone who can actually put the pressure on Boris Johnson on the Conservatives while we go through the next leadership election,\" added the Scot.Elsewhere, a call was made for Karie Murphy, Mr Corbynrsquos Chief of Staff, and Seumas Milne, his Director of Communications, to go too.One Labour MP told the PoliticsHome website: \"Jeremyrsquos departure is totemic but, ultimately, irrelevant.

Brexit,not lsquodonersquo, is certainly now decided. The government will do what the people asked it to do nearly four years ago, and leave the EU. Thatrsquos good: I voted Remain, but I lost, and in a democracy, you must allow the winners to win.How do we relate that concept of the mandate, of democracy, to Scotland and to independence  That is the question which we will now wrestle with as Scots over the next  months, and quite probably for years thereafter, with the attention of the UK and the world on us.:Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for The discussion has begun it began at .pm on Thursday night after the exit poll predicted another surge towards the SNP. Inevitably, the SNP claimed a mandate for indyref. It was the fourth time such a mandate had been claimed since the  independence referendum. The first was in , after the SNPrsquos -seat landslide the second was in June , after the UKrsquos Brexit vote fulfilled the SNPrsquos manesto criteria of Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will the third was after the party won the  General Election, and this was the fourth.Opposing, the Tories, of course, claimed that no such mandate exists. They cite ious reasons, principally that in this election many SNP candidates expressly said a vote for them was not a vote for indyref and that the SNPrsquos campaign slogan was lsquoStop Brexitrsquo, as well as the old favourite, that the  independence referendum was claimed by the SNP at the time to be lsquoonce in a generationrsquo.The reality, political and democratic, lies somewhere in between these competing claims. The strongest of all the SNPrsquos claimed mandates is, in fact, the one which emanated from the combination of the  Holyrood election and the Brexit referendum. The manesto called for a second referendum in the event of certain circumstances and specically cited the circumstance of the UK voting to leave the EU with Scotland voting to remain.I take the view that this qualies as a mandate, but I accept that it is not so clear as to be inarguable. It was by definition caveated, and its electoral endorsement is partly tied to a contorted pledge in the Green manesto which, as far as it is understandable, has probably not been met.The Tories, too, have a point. Whilst their lsquoonce in a generation argumentrsquo is bogusthe argument that last Thursdayrsquos election does not constitute a specic mandate is solid.The voting patterns in Scotland were quite clear - the Tory vote stayed relatively solid and the collapsing Labour vote went primarily to the SNP, and to a degree to the Lib Dems, both on the basis of Brexit. This was a Brexit election in Scotland just as it was in England, and that was the key driver for voters with pencil in hand.A sensible discussion between Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon could bring common ground and common sense to the frenzy. Sturgeon should find it easy to accept that there will be no referendum in , mainly because it is an open secret that she and her team do not actually want a referendum next year, with their pro-independence polling numbers looking far weaker than they had expected them to, given the perfect storm of Boris and Brexit.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteSimilarly, Johnson, fresh off a campaign which was based on upholding democracy by lsquogetting Brexit donersquo as the people had asked, should be able to relate to a clear indyref mandate emerging from an election in which it will be the main issue.This all points to the  Scottish Parliament election - the most important there has ever been. That election will be fought on very clear ground, with very likely no room for debate on anything other than indyref. If the SNP wins that election with a clear manesto commitment for a second vote, a full two parliamentary terms after their first win, there can be no serious grounds to oppose it.You canrsquot be a fair-weather democrat. You canrsquot demand to get Brexit done because voters asked for it whilst demanding that indyref is continually rejected despite voters asking for it.For Johnson to concede this point, the Scottish Tories will need to play a key role, and their position over the coming months will be worth analysing. Although under the circumstances, they ed a creditable result last Thursday, they should not allow it to paper over the cracks which are clearly there.The Tory strategy ndash no to indyref ndash was designed to expand its vote by encouraging Labour unionists to lend their vote to the Tories. That strategy crashed and burned on Thursday. Are the Tories, who have become institutionally obsessed with indyref, nimble enough to reflect upon the fact that they may have maximised that ultra-Unionist vote  I am not so sure.A subtle change in position could help them, whilst also providing them with a more credible, democratic position on indyref to match the credible, democratic position they have held on Brexit.Their position has been lsquovote for us and we will stop indyrefrsquo they should alter it ahead of  to lsquovote for us or we will not be able to stop indyrefrsquo. In other words, the party should acknowledge that a mandate in  will have to be respected, and there will have to be another independence referendum, soyou donrsquot want one then you had better vote Tory.This change in strategy would serve three purposes. Firstly, it would incentivise the core vote in just as compelling a way as the current strategy - frankly, itrsquos not as though they are going to vote for anyone . Secondly, it would respect democracy, and in times such as these, that would be a noble act. Thirdly, and most importantly, it would be a departure of the tired, old, failed Tory strategy of the last  years, which in the final analysis has always been: say no to Scotland.Not for the first time in Scottish Tory history, they are struggling to see that this is failing, and is simply pushing people away from the Union and towards independence.The irony of all of this is that the Nationalistsrsquo strength is over-estimated by Unionists, who have become so paranoid about indyref that they seem blind to the fundamentals which are in place, and which may allow the unionists to record a larger win than last time, closing the book on independence just like they closed the book on Brexit.All they have to do is smarten up.

Both leaders benefited from voters doing what they wouldnrsquot normally do. In the case of the PM, it was Labour voters in the north of England voting Tory, and in the case of the First Minister, it was unionist voters supporting the SNP. It brought Mr Johnson a win and Ms Sturgeon a win within a win.:Andy Maciver: The Tories cant keep on saying no to ScotlandBut,Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon are not to come a cropper, both of them are going to have to understand whatrsquos really going on here. Many,not most, of the English voters who supported the Conservatives in traditionally Labour areas did so because they wanted to see Brexit happen, and many,not most, of the Scottish voters who supported the SNP in traditionally Conservative or Labour areas did so because they wanted to see Brexit stopped. In that sense, they voted for an outcome rather than a party.The conversations Irsquove had in the last few days with unionists who voted SNP have revealed a bit more about what that means. Most of them are still opposed to, or suspicious about, independence, and they agonised over whether voting SNP was the right thing to do. But, in the end, they concluded Brexit and a Tory government was the greater evil. One voter told me his vote for the SNP was in no way a pro-SNP vote, simply a way of ensuring a Brexit supporter did not win in his three-way marginal. ldquoIrsquom not a nationalist and never will be, he said.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Election : How the UK constituency map looks after Tory victory\",\"description\": \"Election : How the UK constituency map looks after Tory victory\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ekuyFAjQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ekuyFAjQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": However, this election was never going to be just about Brexit, and the unionists who voted SNP were aware of the other possible consequences of their vote. In the last bit of the campaign, the SNP appeared to play down independence and play up ldquoStop Brexit, but voters knew or suspected that Nicola Sturgeon would interpret support for her party as support for another independence referendum, which is precisely what happened. Admittedly, the First Minister did say that not everyone who voted SNP supported independence, but she also said her partyrsquos success provided a renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate for a new Scottish referendum.This did not please the SNP-voting unionists I spoke to, even though they knew it was likely to happen. One said to me that Ms Sturgeonrsquos use of the election result was cynical and had made her less likely to vote SNP a second time. It might also have helpedthe First Minister had acknowledged the subtleties, nuances and conflicting emotions that led Scottish voters to act in ways they never had before, rather than rushing to claim a mandate for a second referendum.Weirdly ndash because hersquos anything but subtle ndash Boris Johnson actually did a better job of talking about this phenomenon of ldquolent votes. He could have sounded triumphalist he could have clenched his fists and cheered at the defeat of Labour candidates in traditionally Labour areas.But instead he said that he recognised some votersrsquo hands might have ldquoquivered before they put their cross in the Conservative box. He also said he knew that many of those voters probably intended to vote Labour next time round. Rather than claiming the voters as Tories, it was an acknowledgement of what was actually going on with some people, and Nicola Sturgeon should have done something similar in a lot more detail and with a lot more humility.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteMs Sturgeon and her advisors should also be cautious about what they take from this for the future. As my SNP-voting unionists explained, they voted the way they did in the general election mostly because they felt they had no choice. They were in constituencies where, because of the first-past-the-post system, voting SNP was the only way to maximise the chances of thwarting the Tory and voting against Brexit. Truthfully, they would rather have voted Labour or LibDem and in a proportional system, they would have done. But instead, because of the system we have and with Brexit as the main concern, reluctantly, fretfully, and with a heavy heart, they voted SNP.Obviously, the same rules will not apply when the  Scottish general election comes round: under proportional representation, voters will be free to vote for a party they believe in. This means many of those who voted SNP in  because of Brexit and Boris will revert to their previous choices in , not only because Brexit will presumably no longer be the issue it once was but because voters will understand that independence really will be on the ballot in  and therersquoll be no question about how their vote will be used by the SNP.Not everyone will behave in the same way of course. One of the voters I spoke to, a man who voted No in  and SNP this year, said he wouldnrsquot rule out supporting a future independence referendumit was the lesser of two evils.However, for other unionists who have just voted SNP, the  Scottish election will be a chance to vote against independence just as the  UK election was their chance to vote against Brexit. What this means is that, far from being the beginning of a surge for the SNP, the election wersquove just been through could be a high tide. Maybe the First Minister gets this. Maybe she realises some of the votes she won last week are only on loan. And maybe she should think about it a bit more before she clenches her fists in triumph."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-consciously-played-part-labours-general-election-defeat-claims-mp","story":"Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald made the claims during an interview on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.It came as the partyrsquos leadership battle descended into acrimony with Jeremy Corbyn facing renewed criticism and one of his key allies being accused of calling voters ldquostupid.Presenter Justin Webb asked Mr McDonald about Labourrsquos heavy losses and whether the partyrsquos leader played a part in that.Mr McDonald said: ldquoDonrsquot get me started on the media, Justin.

With one in three Scottish children living in poverty, there are thousands more in need of urgent help.The charity has recently published research which revealed children growing up in our most deprived communities are three times more likely to die by the age of .Itrsquos a horrendous statistic that should shame us all. Imagine the pain a family will experience this Christmas where a child will not be present because their le has been tragically cut short.ldquoThe real tragedy is that most of these deaths can be avoidedhelp and support could be delivered earlier explains Chief Executive SallyAnn Kelly. ldquoEarly intervention can never be early enough she adds.She cites the charityrsquos Perinatal Befriending Service as one example where Aberlour are helping children from the very start to give them the best chance to thrive in le.Described as an ldquoinvaluable resource for families, it offers personalised, practical and emotional support for parents and parents-to-be who are struggling with perinatal mental ill health from conception up until the childrsquos #rst birthday.The aim is to help develop a positive relationship between mum, dad and baby. As well as providing inidual support in the family home and community, the volunteer befrienders also help parents access support from other relevant services in their communities.Caitlin Armitt, a mother from Falkirk, has credited the service with saving her le and is looking forward to celebrating Christmas this year with her two year old son Harrison.ldquoHarrison would not be spending Christmas with me this year without Aberlour, explains Caitlin.ldquoThis time two years ago I was at rock bottom. I was having suicidal thoughts. Harrisonrsquos birth had been traumatic wersquod had trouble bonding and I had post-natal depression.ldquoEveryone around me was getting ready for Christmas, but I didnrsquot even notice.ldquoI couldnrsquot even get off the sofa, never mind go Christmas shopping. How could I think about organising presents when I didnrsquot even have the energy to get dressed  Itrsquos a horrible time to look back on. I felt like I was a terrible mum. I started to think that Harrison didnrsquot need me, that hersquod be better off without me. I was so low, I started to think about ending it all.Across Scotland, perinatal mental illness, the term used to cover all mental health issues during pregnancy and the #rst year after birth, affects almost one in three mothers and one in  fathers.It includes anxiety, depression and psychosis-related disorders and is the leading cause of death for mothers during pregnancy and the year after birth.Christmas can be a particularly challenging time.ldquoYou wouldnrsquot recognise the Caitlin I met at the start of this process says Claire, the volunteer Befriender who was paired with Caitlin.ldquoShe couldnrsquot leave the house, she was suicidal, and she had no belief in herself as a mother.ldquoThroughout the befriending journey I was there for Caitlin: I listened to her worries and concerns and I held Harrison when she just needed five minutes to herself for a cup of tea. When her mood started to improve, and she was able to leave the house, I went with her to soft play and antenatal classes.ldquoSometimes, you just need a person who is there for you, with no judgement and preconceptions, says Claire. Had Caitlin not received Aberlourrsquos support and had she taken her own le, the consequences and le chances for Harrison could have been radically dferent.ldquoI am determined that Harrison and I are going to have the best Christmas ever this year, says Caitlin.ldquoWersquoll be decorating gingerbread cookies, going to have breakfast with Santa and seeing our family. Itrsquos going to be amazing!ldquoThe sad thing is, I know that there are lots of families across Scotland who wonrsquot be having such a joyful Christmas.

LINK has already been touch with  of the  of those who feel there is a need for a free cash machine.And it has confirmed it has sanctioned a second free ATM due to be installed in Gartcosh after the local tenants and residents association called for help.It is understood a free ATM machine was voted the second most commercial asset requested by residents in a recent community survey only surpassed by a GP surgery.Applications are being looked at on a case-by-case basis, depending on factors such as distance to nearest free ATM, the availability of a nearby Post Office and site security.If there is another free cash machine within km within the community and no particular geographical challenges to reaching it, applications may be unlikely to be successful.LINK admit \"more still needs to be done\" to protect access to cash and accepts there will be further challenges to install ATMsshops refused to have them or there was no other obvious spot to position one.Nick Quin, LINKs head of financial inclusion who oversees the requests for ATMs across the UK said: \"It is about responding to needs. We have an ultimate pot of money from the banks and building societies and at the minute it is poundm. We are expecting it to be poundm.\"It will take us some time to work through the applications. It could take three to six months to install [after approval].\"Where we think there is a cash access need, we will go and look at the site and visit it in person, speak to the retailer, speak to people locally and try to get to the bottom of it, because a lot of this comes down to practical questions of what you can actually do there.\"The broad approach is we want to hear from people where there is a problem, and we want them to tell us what the problem is.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain. As well as delivering the long-term benefits of the investment for the future of the town and its environment, we have worked to minimise any short-term disruption for the neighbours of the site and to make a positive contribution to the le of the local community.“We are very grateful for the welcome we’ve been given and for residents’ support and understanding while construction was underway.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wee sleep out at logie durno school","story":"Pupils and staff at Logie Durno Primary School took part in a sleep out to raise awareness of homelessness.The school held its ‘Wee Sleep Out’ on Thursday, December  - the day before the international ‘World’s Big Sleep Out’ day.Head teacher Elizabeth McMahon said: “The event went really well, I was bowled over as all but two of our pupils took part, it was absolutely fantastic.“The pupils made a ten minute film focusing on the matter of homelessness so they are really clued up with why we decided to do this.“The matter was quite new and challenging for them as they weren’t aware of it before but now they are keen to help and make a dference.“We raised nearly £, which is really incredible as we are a small school of just  pupils.”She added: “I am ever so proud of the children.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jack McCranor during his work experience day at the new Inverurie Community Campus site\"  Jack enjoys work experience day viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmOrkney’s new tugs will be called Odin of Scapa and Thor of Scapa.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members. That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stood as an independent candidate in the  General Election, receiving  votes — despite making previous comments to The Orcadian that the election was #illegal#.But SIC has said that placards erected in Shetland by Mr Hill were #unauthorised#, in that he had not sought prior approval before erecting them.In a press release issued on behalf of the #Sovereign Nation of Shetland#, Mr Hill claimed that the SIC roads department had carried out its #threat# to remove his election signs — which he believes it had no authority to do.He said: “Apparently the left hand doesn#t know what the right hand is doing and neither has the authority to do anything. This is just a strong arm tactic from those who want our message suppressed.#It has long been customary to put up signs on lamp posts at election time and when I was a candidate, no permission was asked and no objections were made. As for not being a candidate – that is nonsense.#I have a message just as valid as any candidate for those wanting to make a legitimate protest vote about the £ million Shetland and Orkney pay to the UK every year for nothing in . Rather than vote in an MP, who can do nothing about it, people should write NO THANX across the ballot paper to keep the power here. All spoiled papers are counted.#The SIC did not have the authority to take down my signs. I will be charging them for doing so. Supporters have rallied round and new ones will be printed and re-erected today. We will not be bullied by those who do not like our message.”Responding to Mr Hill#s comments, a spokeswoman from SIC said:#The road service of the council is in communication with Mr Hill over the matter of unauthorised placards, but we will not publicly comment at this point.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels.

It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan.

Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen .."},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael holds onto his seat ","story":"Alistair Carmichael has been ed as the MP for Shetland and Orkney for a sixth time.The longstanding isles MP won with over , votes, as the SNP were pipped to second place.SNP candidate Robert Leslie garnered , votes compared to Mr Carmichael#s ,.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives came third, Labour fourth and Brexit Party fth, with independent candidate David Barnard coming last.Tory candidate Jenny Fairbairn polled , votes, Labour#s Coilla Drake ,, Robert Smith and anti-monarchy candidate David Barnard garnered  votes.There were  spoiled ballot papers, some of which may have been influenced by campaign by activist Stuart Hill, who called on voters to write #no thanx# across the paper.The result in this constituency is perhaps unsurprising.

The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives.

This will hopefully be their last big fundraising push to clear the cost of building the halls and new rooms  years ago. Entrance to the Festival will be through the main doors of the church on Maypole Hill . Walk into the church sanctuary and you will discover a space transformed by lights and creativity. Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death. A Kids’ Craft room will be open for children to take some time to also engage with the theme of Christmas Joy.When you’ve spent some time taking in the Christmas forest, head through the link corridor to the new hall, where hot drinks and festive treats will be served. Viewing of the trees and enjoying refreshments can take place on Friday pm-pm, Saturday am-.pm and Sunday pm-pm. The suggested donation for entrance is £and gts will be gratefully received.Rev. Ross Harte from Dromore Methodist Church explained: “We are honoured that the Festival will be opened by the Lord Mayor of Armagh, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council, Councillor Mealla Campbell . The Methodist North Eastern District Superintendent, the Rev. Philip Agnew, will lead us in prayer during the Opening Ceremony and a local school choir will be singing.“Our annual Christmas Fair will be happening as usual on Saturday, December  , with crafts, cakes, decorations and a range of second-hand books and goods on offer. On the Saturday evening we’re looking forward to Storyteller and Methodist Lay Leader, Mrs. Lynda Neilands, joining us for an informal Worship Night at pm. The evening will include lots of singing, and Lynda will be telling Christmas stories.“The following daywe’ll be delighted to welcome the Methodist President, the Rev. Sam McGuffin, as preacher for our Sunday morning service at am. And the Christmas Tree Festival will conclude with our annual Carol Service at .pm. All special events are open to the public.“We’re really looking forward to this celebration of joy, and with nearly forty Christmas trees confirmed it promises to be a beautul and inspiring visit for all who come to view the displays and enjoy refreshments afterwards.”Family and police are desperately searching for missing Gillian Barr - last seen days ago Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"capture the christmas magic with peter pan","story":"THE Lyric Theatre foyer was packed with Christmas jumpers, palpable excitement– and that was just the adults as we all gathered for the Saturday matinee of Peter Pan.The classic and beloved story of JM Barrie’s boy who never grew up, his band of merry Lost Boys, Wendy and her brothers Michael, John and dog Nana are all present in Paul Boyd’s musical adaptation – with a few new twists for the  festive audiences.We are introduced to Wendy Darling against a starry backdrop, reading the children’s Peter Pan pirate adventure story to her brothers, who are enraptured to find out what happens next as the last chapter of their book is missing. As their parents leave for a dinner party they are left under the care of a stern Nanny Cooksonwho leaves open the children’s bedroom window as Peter Pan and loyal sidekick Tinkerbell ask the Darling’s to come to Neverland. It’s here that the magic of theatre really packs a punch as our actors fly through the London skyline and past the chimes of Big Ben.Vibrant colours, giant flowers, and an introduction to Tiger Lilly mark our arrival in Neverland as the adventure unfolds for our characters.The interval climax is a trio of glistening, sparkly mermaids whose ‘Queen Bah-Ree’ can hit the high notes that Mariah Carey would be proud of and is played to the hilt by Alan Richardson.Allison Harding makes for a superb, villainous Captain ‘Jess’ Hook and is matched perfectly with Christina Nelson’s Miss Smee.Michael Mahoney plays our hero with cracking energy and at times vulnerability as he leads his Lost Boys and the Darling children to safety after defeating his nemesis aboard the Jolly Roger.The five and eight-year-old we had with us for the performance were sat bolt right up from the opening scenes and were still wondering how Peter, Wendy and the Darling children were able to fly before they turned in for bed later that night.Families and children of all ages, including two almost -year-olds loved this adaptation from start to finish, with memorable songs, stunning effects, costumes and even a giant crocodile for good measure.Catch the magic over the Christmas period.Peter Pan runs at the Lyric Theatre until January .

The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"voters go to polls for westminster election","story":"POLLING stations have opened across the North in the General Election. candidates are competing for  Westminster seats.Polling stations opened at am and will close at pm with results expected to be finalised early on Friday morning.A total of ,, people are eligible to vote across the north.North Belfast is expected to witness one of the tightest contests, between DUP’s Nigel Dodds and Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, with Nuala McAllister of Alliance the other candidate on the ballot paper.In South Belfast, SDLP’s Claire Hanna is the bookies favourite to oust outgoing DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly.

I think the public have made it very, very clearSDLP leader Colum Eastwood“If the parties cannot come to an agreement in a couple of days I think then the two governments should put a document in place and force us to either say yes or no and then they should publish that document, because I think what’s been missing in this process is transparency,” he said.“I genuinely believethe public could see what is at issue with these talks then they would be furious, because what has been debated over the last couple of years is what you actually call Irish language legislation, and that’s been the height of it.”Mr Eastwood said the electorate had delivered a message to the politicians that they needed to get back to work.“People have made it very clear they are sick of this – they are sick of this standoff, it hasn’t solved anybody’s problems, it hasn’t taken anybody off a waiting list, it hasn’t fixed nurses’ pay, it hasn’t done any of that,” he said. “The only way you do that is by getting into government and taking responsibility.”He added: “The idea we can be off the pitch any longer is just not acceptable any more. I think the public have made it very, very clear. They want Stormont back up and running.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said she had seen part of the governments’ draft document.“It’s not a complete document, it’s not a finished article, I think the next week is about trying to find out what input the parties want to make to it,” she said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Alliance Party leader Naomi Long at Stormont “Just allowing this to drt in talks and more talks has come to an end. My advice to the governments isthey can’t get an agreement round the table then they publish their draft and ask parties to either accept or reject it and let’s decide once and for all and let the public know.”She referenced a previous break-down in talks last year when the DUP and Sinn Fein traded allegations about whether a draft deal had been agreed in principle before negotiations ended in acrimony.“No more of this ‘there was a deal, there wasn’t a deal’ nonsense that we’ve had before with things that have fallen apart,” said Ms Long.“Let people know what was on offer and let people judge whether their elected representatives are actually representing them or not.”Ms Long, whose party defeated the DUP in the race to win the North Down seat in the election, said parties needed to put the elections behind them.“We have three working weeks to deliver, so this week can’t be about people sitting around and licking their wounds or preening themselves after last week’s elections,” she said.“The elections are over, we are now down to the hard graft of getting an Assembly ing.”Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, whose party failed to make the inroads it had hoped in the election, said he had raised concerns about the health service during his meeting with Mr Smith.“The one thing we must see is a responsible and accountable government brought back and one where the challenges of the past are identied and that is going to mean signicant changes across the board andwe can’t get reformation in the process we have to ask ourselves what’s the point of bringing it back,” he said.“If we can’t bring it back by the middle of January we must have proper government in Northern Ireland –that is direct rule, then it’s direct rule.”Mr Aiken said it was unlikely a deal would be struck before Christmas.“I would say thatthere is goodwill I think we might get a deal by the middle of January, but there needs to be goodwill and there needs to be substantial reform,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"how an omagh dj went from dole to radio 1 in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Back in  he represented the area as mayor, later becoming its MLA.Twelve years later he is now the constituencys MP - a triumph for Alliance which few political pundits would have been comfortable betting their money on until yesterday, with most predicting the seat was there for the DUPs taking.Dr Farrys Westminster win is no mean feat - voters held his successor, the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, in huge affection. Like Lady Hermon, he is a firm Remainer, and during his campaign he was keen to stress their shared Brexit position.A Queens University graduate in Politics with a PhD in International Relations, Dr Farry is only the second Alliance politician to be elected to Westminster in its history.A fitting development, perhaps, given the Newtownards man is arguably Alliances second most high-profile name, behind leader Naomi Long.During his tenure in the Executive, he served as minister for employment and learning, and gained widespread praise for capping tuition fees in September . Following the  Assembly elections, he took up positions on the Stormont Committee for the Economy and Business Committee, positions he held until the collapse of power-sharing in .His political work has also garnered global attention: in  he was appointed an International Peace Scholar by the US Institute of Peace. The -year-old has always been a passionate advocate of Alliances cross-community ethos, but he himself has been caught in the crossfire of Northern Irelands green and orange politics.In , after fellow party members on Belfast City Council voted in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at City Hall to specic days throughout the year, his own constituency office in Bangor was the target of an attempted arson attack. But with Alliances gains in this latest election, Dr Farry will be hoping it indicates potential for growing the middle ground in local politics. *Stephen Farry was not available for an interview yesterday.Stephen FarryAllianceNorth DownWon by: , votesBrexit: Remain"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38791300.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/ULSTER%20Po%2027.jpg","title":"now is the time to get stormont up and running says coveney as dup and sinn fein leaders call for cash injection","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He appeared to rule out the suggestion that some of the big ticket issues could be parked, or moved into a separate process, to enable the restoration of devolution immediately.\"The biggest tragedy for this talks process would be for this assembly to get up and running and then fail,\" he said.\"We have to address head-on the major issues that need resolving.

In - six people tragically lost their lives as a result of accidental house fires, and four of these fatalities occurred during the winter period.Therefore Northern Ireland Fire  Rescue Serviceis urging the Community to be aware of their own fire safety, and the safety of others, during the winter months and festive period.Alan Walmsley, Assistant Chief Fire  Rescue Officer, explains: “This year I am calling on the Community to look out for each other throughout the winter months. During these colder months it’s more crucial than ever that people check in with their older family, friends and neighbours, and those who are isolated in our community.“Please consider their wellbeing and ensure they have a working smoke alarm. Check their home for Christmas fire hazards, such as candles, Christmas tree lights, portable heaters, and overloaded sockets, and make sure they are being used safely, in order to ‘STOP’ fire in their home. Please refer them to us for free Home Fire Safety Checknecessary.“Also,you hear a neighbour’s smoke alarm going off, don’t ignore it- go and check. If there’s a fire, oryou can’t be sure, ring  and ask for NIFRS.“We want you to enjoy yourself over the coming weeks by following our fire safety advice and ensuring you’re prepared for winter. By looking after your own safety, and the safety of those around you, you are not only helping to protect you and your loved ones from a range of fire and other emergencies, but you are also helping us as a Fire  Rescue Service. We are all ‘Safer Together.’“Our Firefighters continue to be out on the ground engaging with at-risk people and we continue to work with our partners, from other voluntary and statutory organisations, to identy and reach those people who need our help most.“We continue at this time of year to respond to a wide range of emergencies and are well-prepared and well-rehearsed in terms of our contingency planning for any severe weather conditions that we may encounter over the next couple of weeks. “I am encouraging everyone to also think about their own personal preparedness for the challenges that winter weather can bring. Please take extra care while driving as winter weather, combined with the dark evenings and the Christmas rush, heightens the dangers on our roads.“Happy Christmas and stay safe in .” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But in terms of other issues facing the city, Mr Eastwood said he will argue for “properly directed investment” in the city that will require a Stormont government.“We have been failed by people who have run the government here for too long and it’s time to get that fixed,” he said.Voters in the North, and in Scotland, rejected Boris Johnson but he did express disappointment at the overall result which secured a large majority for the Conservative party.“In politics you have to play the ball where it lies, we did our bit, others didn’t, but we have to find a way of protecting ourselves.”Talks are set to resume at Stormont and the Derry man suggested he is prepared to go into oppositionthe city’s interests are cast aside.“After the last Assembly election there was a change because of the Fresh Start Agreement which meant you had to have a negotiation and a programme for government. We went into that negotiation determined to get Magee expanded, more social houses built and a few other things, and they weren’t asks that should’ve been hard to deliver.“The DUP and Sinn Feacutein refused to even negotiate with us on that basis so we said well see you we’ll go into opposition to try to argue for those things from that position.“They know thatthey want an all-inclusive government then they have to look after the people of Derry first.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Fight’ The SDLP leader said he knew the party was doing well during canvassing but didn’t think he would win by such a large margin, billed as a “tight fight”, that’s the way they treated it.On Friday Mr Eastwood entered a room above the Pickled Duck cafeacute along with his we, Rachael, and daughters to applause from his party members and supporters.He began by thanking his team. “A couple of years ago when we lost this seat, we didn’t fold up the tent, we didn’t walk away quietly. We became very determined that this city’s representation, not just for us, not at all for us in fact, but for the people of Derry.“I think we’ve been starved over the last couple of years of representation, I wish we had MPs when they were very tight votes on Brexit. But we have a fight on our hands now and we have to fight against Boris Johnson who now has a Tory majority, he will do all sorts of negative things for the people of this city and we have to be there, not just speaking but voting against him and taking the fight to this new Tory government. “And I pledge on behalf of the people in this room and the people of Derry to take that fight right to the heart of Westminster.He continued: “We heard very loudly on the doors what people wanted, they wanted representation at Westminster and their voice heard but they also wanted government in Stormont and people to deal with the crisis in our health service. They don’t think it’s good enough for people to stand on picket lines and then not go to work the next day to try to sort out the problems faced by our low-paid health workers.”He also highlighted teachers who are having to bring the most basic resources to school because there is no education budget.“People in this city know the old story of Derry, that generations of our people leave here and don’t come home because there aren’t enough jobs, because previous Executives haven’t invested in our university to attract and keep those jobs. That’s the work that we have to be engaged in now, we don’t take one vote we got for granted, we know the work that we have to be about and that work starts on Monday morning.“This party is very grateful for the huge endorsement that we’ve got, but we know it’s not about us, we know it’s about the people of Derry roaring a message to politicians that ‘it’s time to get on with the job’. And we’re very grateful for people from right across the political ide for coming and rallying behind us and I just want to say to them, we won’t let you down.” googletag.cmd.push Stormont Mr Eastwood will attend Westminster tomorrow. Making reference to other results across the North, he said it is about people “raising their voices against Brexit and for a sensible accommodation to bring people back together again.”The Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith knows “we have to get back around the table urgently…we heard it loudly and clearly, let’s get back to work,” he added.“Everybody in this room either is on a waiting list or knows someone who’s on one. It’s a terrible inditement of our politics and it’s time we fixed it. Everybody in this room has had a member of their family, or many members, leave this city because they just can’t make ends meet being here, that’s a terrible inditement of our politics. “Everybody in this room knows what has to happen, we have to take responsibility, we have to take power in our hands to deal with the problems faced by our voters. No longer is it good enough to stand on the side lines, no longer is it good enough to look in the window, we have to be in there, that’s what people want us to do, that doesn’t just mean Westminster that means Stormont as well so let’s get on with it.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The cause was not something in the water and the school did not travel back in time to the s. Staff supported a “Movember” campaign to raise money for a very worthwhile cause which was very well supported and raised pound.!Brian Injury Mattersis a local charity and was founded in . It aims to help and support children, young people and adults who have an acquired Brian Injury to live as full a le as possible and to aid the process of rehabilitation. The charity relies very heavily on support from the public and Community Engagement Officer, Treasa Rice made the trip to Dungiven to receive a cheque from the school this week.Mary Uiacute Dhuibhne who works at the Gaelcholaacuteiste had high praise for the charity. Mary’s son Peadar Pio acquired a brain injury following an accident when playing two years ago and BIM provided much needed support for Peadar Pio and his family. Peadar Pio, who is currently in Rang  in Gaelscoil Neachtain, is now making excellent progress in his recovery, he is back playing footballand is looking very much forward to joining the Gaelcholaacuteiste team next year when he transfers to the school in September.Although the end of November witnessed the end of the fund raising, some members of the staff appear to have grown attached to their new look and have decided not to shave just yet - to the consternation of their co-workers! It might be the case that another campaign may be called for to encourage a clean shaven appearance among staff in the future!In another fundraising event for the same charity, a screening of Miracle on th Street will take place at An Coire, Maghera on Sunday, December .

He succeeds Rt Rev Ken Good who retired from episcopal ministry in May.The stormy December weather did not deter scores of people from the Diocese of Derry and Raphoe, or from the parish where Bishop Forster had been Rector, from travelling to Armagh for the ordination, and the church was filled for the occasion.The congregation heard the preacher, Revd Canon Maurice Elliott – who has known the new bishop since their first day at Theological College – describe Rt Rev Forster as a larger than le personality with an infectious sense of humour. “He will bring an immense range of gts and abilities to this new role,” Canon Elliott said. “He is a man of deep conviction, yet he tempers this with an instinctive capacity to care.”Canon Elliott said from the moment, just over  years ago, that he and Bishop Forster arrived “literally together” into Braemor Park, to begin theological training, they had struck up what had become a lelong friendship. It was a singular honour, he said, to have been invited by the Archbishop to preach on this momentous occasion of Bishop Forster’s consecration.Their long friendship did not prevent the preacher from sharing one story – at the Bishop-elect’s expense – from the rugby pitch at Trinity College during their first year of training together in . “In the rather vain pursuit of fitness,” he said, “the Bishop-elect and I decided we would attend Monday evening rugby training and we were perhaps only five minutes into a warm-up when the coach told us to get into pairs. So, the two of us joined forces. The instruction then followed that we were each to piggyback our partner the width of the pitch and back which I, having opted to be number one, duly did. Then, as the coach shouted for a swt role reversal, I can honestly say I’ve never seen anyone move so fast in the direction of the changing room as he shouted back over his shoulder in my general direction, ‘Come on, we’re going.’ And to be fair, we never went back.“So,” Canon Elliott said, “maybe on that occasion, Andrew didn’t quite demonstrate himself willing to carry a heavy burden but, in so many other ways, the Bishop-elect has proved himself more than able to bear signicant responsibility: first through the years of his curacy at Willowfield then as a chaplain at Queen’s as Incumbent of Drumclfe and most recently as a much, much loved Rector of Drumglass.”The preacher said he had never heard anyone express anything other than deep appreciation of every facet of the Bishop-elect’s ministry. “As a teacher, as a pastor, as an evangelist, as a leader, as an Archdeacon, through his involvement in the structures of the General Synod and the Representative Body, Andrew has shown himself to be diligent, capable, faithful, popular and loving. And in all of this he has been wonderfully supported by Heather, by Hannah, Patrick, Megan, by his wider family, and, not least, also by his late parents Victor and Joan. And Andrew, we all recognise how deeply proud they would have been to have witnessed this moment.”“Bishop-elect Andrew James Forster,” the preacher said, addressing his friend directly, “on this day our deepest prayer for you is that you will stay close to the Lord who was willing to suffer on your behalf. We ask that you may remain focused on the message of the Cross and the empty tomb and that as you are able to do that you will prove yourself not only faithful but resilient and strong. Thirty years ago, you didn’t feel minded to run across a rugby pitch with me on your back but, as you learn increasingly to lean on the Lord’s word for strength and on the Lord’s spirit for stamina, our confidence is that you will run well the marathon of episcopal ministry and that in due course you will finish that race. You cannot do it in your own strength, so even now choose again to undertake it only in the name, and for the sake of, the one who laid down his le for you, and who alone is able to sustain you.”The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Revd Dr Richard Clarke, was assisted during the Consecration by the Bishop of Meath and Kildare, Most Revd Patricia Storey and the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, Right Revd Patrick Rooke. The three were joined for the laying on of hands by the other Church of Ireland serving and retired bishops present, including Lord Eames – a former Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. Next, the newly ordained bishop was vested with his episcopal habit, before being presented to the congregation by the Archbishop, with the words, “Brothers and sisters in Christ, I present to you Andrew, Bishop in the Church of God.” Bishop Forster was then acclaimed with warm and loud applause.Among the many dignitaries from other Churches at the Consecration were the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Sam McGuffin the President of the Irish Council of Churches, Rev Brian Anderson , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Archbishop Eamon Martin and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr William Henry.

The union has said that on completion of the period of industrial action they will develop a plan for further industrial action up to and including March , . NIPSA has said that the current action is necessary because, despite numerous meetings, the employers, the Department of Health and the Government have failed to sufficiently address NIPSA’s claims for pay justice and safe staffing. They added that they will also continue to consult with the other unions to discuss further co-ordination despite having dferent objectives and tactics in the ongoing dispute.Calling on all members to attend picket lines, a statement added: NIPSA has not agreed any exemptions from the industrial action. If the employers identy real emergency situations, they will be able to contact NIPSA’s liaison officers and appropriate arrangements will be put in place. In any incident where strikers carry out agreed emergency cover, NIPSA will view them as acting on behalf of the striking workforce and will expect them to relinquish their wages for the period of the cover.NIPSA Deputy General Secretary Padraig Mullholland said: “The strike on December  will be hard-hitting but our members have no choice but to defend our National Health Service, for too long members have held together a system that is in crisis so that our communities get a decent service.”Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary Maria Morgan added: “Safe staffing and pay justice are at the heart of our dispute, our members have had enough and have made it clear that action is now necessary.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The recent death of Jerry Thompson has shocked fotoball. googletag.cmd.push “I only knew him as an opponent but he was one of those players you would always be looking out for in the other team because he had that bit of quality that youd be worried about,” he said. “Its sad for his family and its sad for football and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his team mates and also his friends. Its devastating to have this to deal with but sadly its all too common in Northern Ireland at the minute.”The nature of Thompsons death, particularly for someone so young, has resumed the conversation about the importance of mental health and McLaughlin agreed that todays youth are often fighting battles that few realise.“Its a stark reminder of young players and what they have to deal with these days in terms of social media and the pressures of le,” he continued.“Some of them take on the pressures of the world and it doesnt have to be like that because there are people out there who can help.

I dont think theres enough done about it in general, but at club level I think every club should be looking into it.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes across the Province, with the remainder of the cash expected to come from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.At this weekrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements.

Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled.

Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station.The Department for Infrastructure, which managed the problem-ridden public realm scheme on behalf of the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council, admitted that the delay had had a ldquonegative impact on trading across the town.Government officials also conceded that more should have been done to keep the Downpatrick business community affected by the overrunning regeneration project better informed.Confirmation that  traders have expressed an interest in the revitalisation scheme was confirmed at this weekrsquos meeting of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.A steering group has been established to oversee the scheme and will work alongside an architect and quantity surveyor to deliver the project.News of the interest in the revitalisation scheme comes ahead of a planned meeting in the New Year to discuss the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.The meeting, which will be attended by council officials and representatives from a number of statutory agencies, is designed to provide traders with an opportunity to have their say on the ambitious retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy.During the meeting, the discussion will help guide the development brief process aimed at paving the way for work on the multi-million pound plan to start.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space, with permission recently secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.When the blueprint for the future development of the site has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.Itrsquos now over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.The ambitious proposal has been described as the most signicant retail and commercial investment plan ever proposed for the town centre, with politicians hopeful that the plan to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a major investment plan will provide a major boost for existing businesses.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news that  traders have expressed an interest in the Irish Street revitalisation scheme and is encouraging traders from across the town to take part in discussions on the future of the former police base site.He said it is critically important that the Downpatrick business community has an insight into helping shape the development brief for the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIt is important that the business community grasps the opportunity it is being given to help shape the future development of a prominent town centre site. Traders must make their voices heard on a project which has the potential to rejuvenate the town centrersquos economy, providing a boost for existing businesses through increased footfall.ldquoI firmly believe that the planned redevelopment of the huge former police base site can attract additional retail investment in the heart of the town..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Trevor.jpg","title":"Trevor to get locks snipped in aid of meningitis research  ","story":"CROSSGAR man Trevor Simpson is having his flowing locks chopped on Christmas Eve to raise funds for the Meningitis Research Foundation.The fundraising haircut will take place in the villagersquos Corner Inn at .pm with the operation performed by Mrs Leta McConnell, owner of My-T-Sharp Barbers.Trevorrsquos fundraiser is his way of giving something back to the charity which helped him through a serious illness after he contracted meningitis in December last year.He said that his fundraiser is to thank a ldquowonderful group of people who helped him when the became ill.In particular, Trevor says that he is grateful to the ldquofantastic staff at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald and Saintfield Health Centre who played a vital role in helping save his le.The Meningitis Research Foundation plays a key role in the UK and Ireland by funding vital research, with Trevor keen to see awareness and training of health professionals improved to provide support and information on this health issue.He said said that ahead of his Christmas Eve fundraiser there has been a lot of support and is encouraging others to make their way to the Corner Inn on December .Anyone wishing to make a donation can contact Trevor on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/entertainment/resources/images/10799881.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

The party is entirely focused on the talks on Monday and getting Stormont back up and running,” he told the Sunday Le.“Arlene will be there leading our team. I and others will be there to support the negotiations and that’s our number one priority.”Yesterday Mrs Foster said that the DUP would ensure that the talks ensured that no party could prevent the formation of a devolved administration. She said: “Central to the talks must be the sustainability of the institutions so never again can one party hold the rest of Northern Ireland to ransom. Sinn Fein has barred everyone from government for three years despite other parties willing to take their seats. “We live in a ided society and to move forward will require all the parties to step up to the plate. For my part, we will not be found wanting. Northern Ireland can only move forward when we are prepared to work together.”Sinn Fein TD Martin Kenny appeared on RTE’s The Week in Politics yesterday, saying his party “absolutely wants to be back in Stormont” in January. “We don’t have any red lines, all we have called for is that all parties need to agree to implement the agreements that have already been reached,” he said.Jim Allister: At this crossroads moment unionism can turn away from a Stormont that Sinn Fein will never allow to give good government Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"UUP leader Steve Aiken, who also suffered a bad election, said: “If talks are to be convened this week then it must be on the basis of restoring sustainable, accountable and transparent government.“There is little point in rushing back into Stormont simply because the DUP and Sinn Fein have decided that now the election is over, they are willing to set their own dferences aside. The operation of the Executive, accountability mechanisms for ministers and spads, as well as the petition of concern must all be subject to major reform.”TUV leader Jim Allister warned that unionism is being led in a direction which will prove damaging: “The pretence of Monday’s talks that a restored Stormont will bring stability and good government is a cruel deception ... any such restoration will inevitably be on Sinn Fein’s terms.”He added: “The supplicant plea of the DUP that it has no red lines is as humiliating as it is inane. If ever there was a time for an immovable red line it is now. And that red line should be no Stormont talks until the terminal threat of an Irish Sea border is reversed.“The fact that such hasn’t even been mentioned demonstrates, sadly, that power, any power, means more than our integral position within the UK. Having been led to electoral defeat, unionism is now being led down a path of folly.”try catch  TrendingNI snow now due to arrive earlier than originally thought - severe gales and heavy rain on way tooThis is what the weather will be like in NI on Christmas Day Tragic woman who drowns off NI coast whilst swimming is named locallyWarning of snow and ice for NI -temperatures to dip below freezing tomorrowNI road closed after road traffic collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"Tributes to larger than le NI footballer Jerry Thompson who died suddenlyTwo arrested after father of two Cecil Foggy Ellis found dead in PortadownNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
