I’d never even thought about that. It was all quite shocking,’ she says. ‘I’m very honest and don’t beat around the bush, but I didn’t expect the amount of vitriol.‘It was like a bomb had gone off. I didn’t even think I had said anything that bad, but I admit that perhaps I didn’t really think about it that much.’Liverpool-born Danielle had three sons, Archie, Harry and George, with her ex husband Jamie O’Hara, the former Tottenham Hotspurs midfielder. The couple orced in 2014. Her fourth son, Ronnie, is with her fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill.She continues: ‘I want a girl and if I can pay for it, then that’s OK, I can get one.’          The 34-year-old, pictured at home, has received thousands of angry messages on Instagram and Twitter, some of them extreme, on the subject of gender selection for babies  Danielle and fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill, during her pregnancy with fourth son RonnieIt is, as she has found, a highly controversial stance – which makes it all the more remarkable that Danielle has agreed to address it head-on.The WHO says that sex selection raises ‘serious moral, legal, and social issues’ and can lead to the devaluation of women and gender imbalance.For all the public and official hostility, though, the fact is that the industry is rapidly expanding to meet a huge and growing demand.And if in Britain the demand remains unspoken, in America it is rapidly becoming the norm for those who can afford it.Dr Jeffrey Steinberg at leading US specialists The Fertility Institutes says he routinely treats A-list actors, pop stars and athletes.Tellingly, of 640 couples who came through his doors in 2017, more than one in ten was British.According to Dr Daniel Potter at rival American clinic HRC Fertility, he sees ten patients a month from this country who want to select the gender of their baby.It is, after all, an age-old wish. From cave paintings depicting a preference for sons, to Aristotle’s prescription for producing boys (tying off of the man’s left testicle), attempts to choose the gender of children go back centuries. But Danielle’s decision to obtain – or effectively buy – a baby girl belongs firmly to the scientific realm.She had first heard about the gender selection procedure in the wake of giving birth to Ronnie, now ten months old. Enquiring further, she learnt that the treatment is accurate in 99 per cent of the cases in which a baby is successfully born and started to investigate the possibility of arranging for the selection of a girl child in Northern Cyprus, another state where it is legal.After further questioning, however, she and fiance Michael settled on America, where they felt the overall safeguards would be stronger.The couple will marry next year, and she will travel to California.    Danielle Lloyd, pictured with sons (from left) Harry, Ronnie, George and Archie, had three children with former Spurs player Jamie O\u0027Hara and one with electrician Michael O’NeillOnce there, a number of her eggs will be harvested and fertilised, and then one or two of the resulting female embryos will be reimplanted in the mother’s womb. The rest will be stored for possible use in the future.It will cost her about £12,000 plus flights and accommodation – and that’s just for one round.But to Danielle, getting the little girl that she craves is worth every penny.‘There’s an urge inside me to have a girl. I just can’t let it go,’ she explains.‘I’ve got such an amazing relationship with my mum. I want to have that bond with my daughter. Why would anyone begrudge me that?‘I also want my boys to have that brother-sister relationship. Our family is not yet complete.‘Michael feels the same way. He really wants a girl. If I had four girls, we’d be going off and getting a boy.‘Realistically, if I’m going to have one more, if this science is there, why not do it? I don’t think it’s a selfish thing to do. I could be selfish and go on for years having more and more boys.‘I’ve got four lovely boys but I don’t want to get to 50 or 60 and think I could have had a girl but didn’t,’ she adds.‘The thought of not going to my daughter’s wedding or not having those chats I have with my mum. Girls always have that relationship with their mothers.’Her television profile does, she admits, make her a lightning rod for criticism, particularly from those who assume she is not merely comfortably off, but rich. ‘People say, “I bet she’s got ten nannies”.          Danielle Lloyd (pictured at home) will go to America for the gender selection procedure, which has been condemned by the World Health Organisation (WHO)‘It really gets my back up. Actually, no. And, before Michael came along, I did it as a single mother.’She claims to understand her critics’ point of view, yet remains defiantly convinced she has the right to press ahead.‘When I mentioned it on television, people phoned in and said that if they did what I was doing in China, where they can have only one child, the population would be just boys,’ she says.‘They told me stories about baby girls being flushed down the toilet. It makes me feel like crying, but I’m nothing to do with that sort of world.‘If I was sitting here with no kids and saying I’m doing gender selection because I only want a girl and not a boy, then of course I’d expect criticism.‘But I’m not.‘I realise people have strong opinions. But I still don’t understand how anyone can call me a disgrace because I want a little girl as well as my boys. I genuinely don’t get what the big deal is.‘If we were having this debate in America, the attitude would be completely different because gender selection is perfectly legal and respectable there. It’s like IVF. They get the egg, artificially inseminate it and then check if the embryo is a girl or a boy.‘They give you the option of inserting one or two embryos. It might not work with one, so you’d have to pay again.‘Obviously there are women who can’t have children and I can totally understand that. To some of them, what I’m going to do makes me a terrible person.‘But at the same time, a lot of women have asked me to let them know where I’m going for the procedure, because they’d love to go there too.‘Women who had already been through it got in touch to pass on their advice.’Her sons, too, are right behind her, she says.‘They ask me every day “Mummy, have you got a baby sister in your tummy yet?” When it comes to birthdays and Christmases, they ask for a sister,’ says Danielle.‘I can see why some people think it’s wrong and selfish. Why don’t you just appreciate the children you’ve got? And, so on.‘But I really do appreciate them. I live for my children and love being a mum it’s what I was made to do.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/11/4F341FA700000578-6075407-The_couple_were_immediately_linked_after_Giggs_split_from_Stacey-a-7_1534676046139.jpg","title":"Ryan Giggs finally goes public secret PR girl lover","story":"Ryan Giggs (left), 44, seemed happy and relaxed as he posed for pictures with PR executive Kate Greville (right), 34, as they explored the town of Ravello on Italy’s Amalfi coast      \u0027You deserve a beer, well done\u0027: Hero tradie pulls driver...Share this articleRyan was soon recognised by fans asking for autographs and selfies but the source told The Sun on Sunday’s Richard Moriarty and Michael Hamilton that they pair looked to be trying to keep a low profile.Kate kept it casual with a lovely dark summer dress which she teamed with a leather jacket while Ryan went for a chinos and a polo shirt.The two arrived on Wednesday and have been seen wandering the sights and enjoying a sunbathe by their hotel’s pool.

You just can’t have jerk rice.\u0027Since then several Twitter users, including Ms Butler, have called Mr Oliver out for incorrectly using the label \u0027jerk\u0027. Regina Holland said: \u0027Just because Dawn Butler\u0027s an MP it doesn\u0027t mean she can\u0027t have an opinion on anything else.

Nothing to do with sharing cultures.\u0027But not everyone has agreed with Ms Butler, with many pointing out that British people eat food from many different cultures.One Twitter user wrote: \u0027Now while I do think Jamie needs taking down a peg or three you\u0027re all getting very silly over this appropriation stuff. If no one cookedate food from other cultures in the world what a boring life we\u0027d lead.\u0027Benjamin Tucker said: \u0027Are you honestly saying that white people can’t cook food from other cultures in case they get it slightly wrong?\u0027 Jamie Oliver and Dawn Butler have been contacted for comment. This is not the first time Mr Oliver has sparked controversy with his own versions of traditional recipes.Back in 2014, he enraged West Africans with a Jollof rice recipe on his website causing a huge backlash dubbed \u0027Jollofgate\u0027.Mr Oliver was criticised for his use of cherry tomatoes on the vine, when Jollof rice is traditionally made with blended tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers. The Motley Musings blogger said at the time: \u0027We have to ask ourselves who actually benefits from Jamie Oliver\u0027s appreciation of Jollof rice. This doesn\u0027t necessarily translate into value for Africans. \u0027For so long, different African cultures have been appropriated without any direct benefit to Africans themselves, and people are particularly sensitive to this.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/15/4F362C4600000578-6075885-image-a-69_1534689579425.jpg","title":"Mike Leighs historic drama Peterloo premiere place 1819 massacre took place","story":"The BFI London Film Festival is set to premiere director Mike Leigh\u0027s new film Peterloo in Manchester, with Maxine Peake (left) addressing crowds (right)  gathered to pay tribute to the historic 1919 massacre on Thursday          Crowds gathered on Thursday August 16 to commemorate the massacre which occurred on the same date and in the same place, 199 years previously It\u0027s the first time the film festival will hold a premiere outside the capital, with a screening to be held in the city\u0027s HOME art centre on October 17.Leigh said: \u0027It\u0027s always an honour to be included in the glorious London Film Festival, but how inspired and generous of the Festival to screen Peterloo in Manchester, where it all happened!

They were almost certainly Wichitas. Intrigued, they offered their equipment and used a magnetometer to detect variations in the earth\u0027s magnetic field and find features around the excavation that looked like homes, storage pits and places where fires were started, the LA Times reported. Continuing to dig, and using the newly translated descriptions from the conquistadors, Blakeslee said he believes he\u0027s found a battle site in what is now an upscale Arkansas City neighborhood.                In 2013, scholars at UC Berkeley announced that they had retranslated murky documents written by Spanish conquistadors more that 400 years ago          Stone weapons and tools such as these have been found at the site in abundanceThe recent discovery of three half-inch iron balls, 17th century Spanish cannon shells and a Spanish horseshoe nail has helped Blakeslee bolster his claims even further.\u0027We\u0027re really proud that all this history happened here, and we want to share it with the world,\u0027 said Hap McLeod, who owns the property where the cannon shot was found.   The only recorded accounts of Etzanoa come from the expedition of Spanish conquistador Juan de Oñate, who in 1601 led a party into the Great Plains in search of the fabled \u0027city of gold\u0027 Quiviria. The expedition came across a war party of 300 to 400 natives, whom Oñate called \u0027Rayados\u0027, or striped ones, for their body paint and tattoos.

This map was drawn in 1602 by a Wichita Indian who was captured by the Spanish. The circular figures represent native settlements. Etzanoa is depicted by two circles with a diagonal line between them at the top center of the map.The conquistador was stunned by the city\u0027s size. Though the rest of the tribe had fled Etzanoa for hiding at Oñate\u0027s arrival, he saw a sprawling settlement across thousands of acres along the bluffs of the confluence of two rivers.   The Spaniard reported the city had 2,000 large, beehive-shaped houses, each large enough to house 10 people, for an estimated population of 20,000. \u0027Why should we take her?\u0027 ISIS bride whose jihadi husbands...Share this articleGrowing nervous at the size of the population they stumbled across, Oñate\u0027s party of roughly 100 men turned back, retracing their steps southward.But suddenly, the group came under attack from a group of more than 2,000 natives from another tribe called the \u0027Escanxaques.\u0027The Spaniards marshaled their small cannons as the attackers charged at them up a rocky ravine, according to the Europeans\u0027 account.The city was never seen by Europeans again, and no group of Wichita peoples that size was ever documented.

And yet you did it anyway. #perpwalk,\u0027 he tweeted in May.Bourdain, 61, and Argento met during the filming of his travel show Parts Unknown in 2016 and began dating a year later. Shortly before he was found hanged in his French hotel room, a paparazzi caught Argento dancing in a Roman restaurant with French reporter Hugo Clément. They were also pictured holding hands and hugging on the streets of Rome.Bourdain committed suicide on June 8, five days after the photos first appeared online. Argento\u0027s friend and fellow Weinstein accuser, Rose McGowan, released a statement after his death, saying that the couple were in a \u0027free relationship\u0027 and \u0027loved without the borders of traditional relationships.\u0027Argento was devastated by Bourdain\u0027s death and released a heartbreaking statement following his suicide, where she described him as \u0027my love, my rock, my protector.\u0027\u0027I am beyond devastated. Anthony gave all of himself in everything that he did,\u0027 she wrote on Twitter. \u0027His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/18/4F3CDC3F00000578-0-image-m-11_1534785208851.jpg","title":"Iconic 60s vehicle ridiculed adored owners making comeback","story":"    Oliver (left) and his brother Merlin Ouboter (right) designed the latest electric bubble car - the MicrolinoBut while the size and performance may be positively bonsai, demand for this bubble car is booming. The brothers initially planned a reservation list of only 500 orders, but they have already received a whopping 7,200 and are hoping to hit an annual output of 10,000 cars.At £10,770, the Microlino certainly doesn’t have a titchy price tag, costing about the same as a Vauxhall Corsa, which has three doors rather than just one. But while the Vauxhall will take just short of £60 to fill, the Microlino can be powered for a pittance — £1.35.Undocumented immigrant and father-of-two, who was caught by...Novichok victim Charlie Rowley is rushed to hospital after...Share this articleOf course, this number crunching rather misses the point of the Microlino. Its allure lies more in a nostalgia for the comic charm of the bubble car.Those with long memories will recognise that the Microlino looks very similar to one of the first bubble cars — the iconic Isetta, which sold a staggering 162,000 worldwide.Designed in 1953 by Italian Renzo Rivolta, whose company made fridges, the Isetta was a response to the public’s desire for an affordable vehicle, as well as one that could negotiate the narrow streets in Italian towns.It was also a hit in West Germany, where an ailing BMW was looking for a car to turn its fortunes around.          The car (pictured) boasts a 20-horsepower motor copied from a small forklift, and reaches a top speed of 56 mphThe Isetta did just that, and motorists marvelled at the fact that it could accommodate a family of three — just — and still park facing the pavement.In Britain, the Isetta was manufactured by a former pilot called R. J. Ashley.But there was a technical hitch with the British version. Because it needed to have right-hand drive, the driver sat on the same side as the engine, which meant all the weight was on one side of the car — risking it toppling over. The solution was simple: a chunky lead weight was embedded in the other side to balance it out.The Isetta’s basic build meant it could be easily adapted. One of the most extraordinary examples was that driven by Horst Breistoffer, who gutted his 1964 model. But his modifications were for a serious purpose — to smuggle refugees through the Berlin Wall from East to West Berlin.Breistoffer’s logic was an impeccable piece of bluff, as he guessed the guards would not bother searching such a small vehicle.On nine occasions, he was proved right. But unfortunately, on the tenth escape attempt, a guard spotted some movement in the back of the car and he and the refugee were arrested.The car is now on display at the Checkpoint Charlie museum in Berlin.Also cramming people into his Isetta at the same time was the actor Ian Ogilvy, who bought a bright yellow version when he was a drama student in London.          The brothers planned a reservation list of just 500 , but they have already received 7,200 orders and are hoping to hit an annual output of 10,000 cars‘One day I happened to mention my holiday plan to drive all the way to Scotland and back in my tiny Isetta bubble car to visit a relative,’ the former star of The Saint recalled recently.‘My friend Gemma Jones asked if she and her boyfriend could come too. I reminded her that with three of us somehow crammed on to the bench seat there would be room — as far as luggage was concerned — for only a toothbrush and a clean pair of knickers. Gemma insisted that it would still be fun.‘So we went to Scotland and back, the three of us, squashed together inside a small yellow metal ball on three diminutive wheels. Top speed was reduced to 40 mph. We even slept in the thing one night. Gemma was right — it was fun.’Germany’s relationship with the bubble car is enshrined in another iconic example of micro-motoring. While for most the name ‘Messerschmitt’ is associated with World War II fighter aircraft, the company also produced a bubble car in the Fifties and Sixties that went through various versions, until it was called the KR200.It was the brainchild of German war veteran Fritz Fend who had lost both his legs and developed vehicles for the disabled.Fend produced a design classic, even if the driving experience left a little to be desired. Not only was the car noisy, but the canopy made it extremely hot.          The new Microlino is very similar to one of the very first bubble cars – the iconic Isetta (pictured), which sold 162,000 units worldwideHowever, it’s the British who can claim the record for creating, according to Guinness World Records, the smallest production car ever made — the Peel P50.The Peel, which was made on the Isle of Man in the Sixties, really was absurdly small, measuring just 4 ft 5 in long and 3 ft 2 in wide. Naturally, as it was little bigger than the average armchair, there was room only for one person, and the whole vehicle weighed just 9 st 6 lb. It even had only one headlight.The car may have had a three-speed gearbox, but what that gearbox lacked was a reverse.To park it, the driver simply got out, lifted the back of the car with a handle and rolled it into position.By the end of the Sixties, the fashion for bubble cars had burst. People wanted bigger, more practical vehicles. But they are still proving to be collectors’ items and can fetch high prices.A 1959 BMW Isetta is currently for sale on eBay for £13,000, while an immaculate 1957 Heinkel Kabine will set you back £25,000.          The Heinkel Cabin car (pictured) was another of the microcars to grow in popularity during the 1950s and 60sPerhaps the most expensive bubble car sold was a 1958 FMR Tg500, auctioned in the U.S. for £252,000 in 2013.Surprisingly, not all bubble car enthusiasts are as diminutive as the vehicles. Take Jim Jamieson, the former owner of a 1960 Isetta, who measures 6 ft 8 in and weighs 25 st — around one third the weight of the car itself.‘I bought the car out of bloody-mindedness and my stupid sense of humour,’ Mr Jamieson says.‘But despite my size, it was absolutely fine. It was used as the Isetta owned by the landlord’s daughter in the TV series Heartbeat, and she would have to drive it in a very spirited way, sometimes just tipping on to two wheels.‘However, the stunt men refused to touch it, saying that the car didn’t have enough wheels! So I had to drive it, all 25 st of me, and wearing a wig, and sitting as low as possible.’Many bubble cars have ended up in garages, forlornly left to rust. But with those rising fuel prices, it is certainly likely they will become more common again.The Microlino is not the only new bubble car on the roads. An electric Peel P50 closely modelled on the original can also be spotted. And look out for the Corbin Sparrow in the U.S., which costs around £23,500.At prices like that, some bubble cars are still not a realistic option for most.But if the Microlino catches on, and gets a little cheaper, there’s a good chance the bubble car industry will once more inflate."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/09/4F3B035E00000578-0-image-m-14_1534753980744.jpg","title":"Britain 21st century exporting superpower Brexit","story":"    The International Trade Secretary, Liam, Fox, urges the country to \u0027set its sights high\u0027 as he outlines a strategy to boost the sales of domestic goods and services overseasIn a speech to a business audience in London today about the export strategy, he is expected to say: \u0027UK businesses are superbly placed to capitalise on the rapid changes in the global economic environment and I believe the UK has the potential to be a 21st century exporting superpower. As an international economic department, we are determined to support, connect and grow UK companies on the world stage through our international network.Property asking prices slump £7k in a month and expert says...FTSE CLOSE: Mulberry blames House of Fraser for £3m profits...Share this article\u0027As we leave the EU, we must set our sights high and that is just what this export strategy will help us achieve.\u0027Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Government\u0027s export strategy is \u0027strong on aspiration\u0027 and welcomed the commitment to increase exports as a proportion of GDP and other measures which could support small firms.He added: \u0027Incentives like export vouchers and grants should be made available to small businesses to help them with upfront investment costs for things like translation services or additional market research.

Today, she struggles to make ends meet.To help pay her way she spends almost every waking hour using scrap paper to hand-make table decorations for Greek weddings. The burden of work means that she is only able to visit her ageing parents, some four hours travel time from Athens, two or three times a year.A hospital doctor among our acquaintances has seen his monthly pay cut to €1,200 (£1,071). It is only his social conscience and love of his country that has kept him in Athens.          The country’s once elegant capital has become one of the most depressing and untidiest cities in Western Europe Some 70,000 highly skilled professionals including doctors, dentists and pharmacists have left the country as part of a broader Grexodus of 500,000 people.The best way for any country to emerge from financial crisis is to increase its national income so that tax revenues rise and global debts can be paid off. But during the last eight years, Greece has moved in precisely the opposite direction. National output has slumped by an astonishing 25 per cent. The result is adult unemployment of 20 per cent. Even more shocking and socially disruptive, some 40 per cent of 18 to 25-year olds are out of work.Without any income for the young, it is now commonplace for three generations of the same family to be forced to live cheek by jowl in the same crowded apartment. The fact is that the austerity imposed by the eurocrats has ruined Greece and done nothing to relieve it of its monstrous level of debt.It has snuffed out entrepreneurship, as well as created a poisonous political legacy where a far-Left Marxist party headed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rules with the support of fanatical politicians on the populist Right.The end of the EU’s bailout programme may technically mean that Greece can return to the international markets to borrow again, but any notion that the world’s commercial bankers and financiers will be queuing at Athens’ overcrowded and dilapidated airport to lend – and pour good money after bad – is a fantasy.          Shops on boulevards are shuttered and cranes stand idle over the shells of unfinished buildings (pictured, Greek riot police dodge a petrol bomb thrown by protesters during clash  over tax reforms in 2016) After all, the country is still sitting on a debt pile of €289billion (£258billion) which the International Monetary Fund puts at 191 per cent, or almost twice the nation’s total annual output.To place that in context, it is more than two times the ratio of Britain’s national debt to output, which after a decade of UK cuts to public services and surging tax incomes as the economy has grown is now, thankfully, on a downward path.Not only that, Greece’s stricken financial system is currently being kept afloat by short-term cash assistance of some €40billion (£35.6billion) per month from the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank. Without this help, which is akin to that provided by the Bank of England to the British banks at the height of the financial crisis a decade ago, the four biggest Greek lenders would be effectively bankrupt.Together the bad loans on the books of these banks – Piraeus, Alpha, Euro Bank and National Bank of Greece – amount to €101billion (£90billion) or 50 per cent of the total, the highest level of any country in the European Union. Indeed the banks, the lifeblood of any Western economy, are so indebted they cannot lend any more.Which means the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the country’s business bedrock cannot get the finance they need to carry on and invest. Nor do ordinary consumers find it possible to obtain credit.This desolate financial scenario is a direct result of the austerity conditions demanded by Brussels eurocrats and German central bankers.Over the last eight years successive Greek governments have been forced to attend no fewer than 95 meetings at which the most stringent measures have been imposed on them.The results for the Greek people have been nothing short of catastrophic.Yet in their determination to preserve the greater political project of the eurozone and the EU, and to keep Greece as their client state, Brussels and German politicians have been utterly ruthless.In spite of personal appeals from the International Monetary Fund’s euro-supporting managing director Christine Lagarde to forgive Greece its debt burden and allow the country to be given a fresh start, the eurofanatics have been unrelenting in their determination to keep the debt anvil hanging around its neck.Greece is in an armlock it cannot escape because of a combination of its debt burden and the fact that its membership of the eurozone means it can no longer devalue its currency. And the EU and Germans are determined to keep it that way to save their precious euro.So despite the joyous news bulletins about the bailout yesterday morning, be in no doubt that this Greek tragedy is very far from over."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/00/4F2C016100000578-0-image-m-4_1534719633251.jpg","title":"GCSE science exam pupils saved moving grade boundaries","story":"    Ofqual said some youngsters who would have picked up a U on results day this Thursday will now get their results bumped up to a pass as grade boundaries changeOfqual lowered the safety net after a larger than expected number of pupils looked set for a U – which stands for unclassified. The move comes amid a row over grade boundaries being set low in the new reformed exams, with some critics warning it is a continuation of a \u0027prizes for all\u0027 culture.Thousands more pupils \u0027to clinch top GCSE grades needed for...Markers grading this year\u0027s GCSE and A-Level exams will be...Share this articleOfqual announced the move yesterday in a blog about the combined science paper, where students are examined in three sciences but it counts as two GCSEs. The new qualification is tiered, meaning teachers have to choose whether to enter children for the higher tier paper or easier foundation tier.The watchdog has refused to disclose how many pupils have been affected, the Times Educational Supplement reported. In a blog post, Cath Jadhav, of Ofqual, said: \u0027For some students... receiving an unclassified result because they had been entered for higher tier would have misrepresented their ability.\u0027           The move comes amid a row over grade boundaries being set low in the new reformed exams, with some critics warning it is a continuation of a \u0027prizes for all\u0027 culture"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/14/4F3C901200000578-0-image-m-40_1534773329152.jpg","title":"Party loving past tangled love life ship plunge Briton Kay Longstaff","story":"    Kay Longstaff had recently been through a ‘hard time’ in her personal life before her cruise ship ordeal, her father said last nightDid she jump? Crew question how British passenger who was...Three people are hurt in shooting outside London Tube...Share this article    Kay Longstaff, an ex air hostess, said to have allegedly jumped from the shipPassengers had previously said they were told the incident had been captured on the ship’s CCTV and showed that Miss Longstaff was on her own when she went over the edge.The Italian authorities appeared to corroborate that yesterday, when they said she ‘most likely jumped’ after apparently rowing with her boyfriend.‘Officers spoke with the woman’s partner on the ship when it arrived in Venice,’ a spokesman told The Sun. ‘The footage has been viewed and you can clearly see she was there on her own when she fell.‘The boyfriend said they had been drinking and they had quarrelled. He went back to his cabin and left her. The next thing he knew he was woken by the crew to say they thought she was missing as they had found her bag and belongings.’By then, the ship – which had been heading back to Venice – had doubled back on itself to search for her.A spokesman for the Croatian ministry of maritime affairs said that by checking CCTV rescuers knew the exact moment Miss Longstaff fell in the water. ‘Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship,’ he said.One passenger said a concierge had claimed Miss Longstaff and her boyfriend had been arguing prior to her disappearance, while another said: ‘When getting off the boat, seven hours late, a number of passengers were saying there had been a midnight dispute among the Longstaff party.’          Three months after setting up home in Torrequebrada with her long-term boyfriend Luke Hopkins (pictured), Miss Longstaff dumped him after seven years – leaving the retail manager heartbrokenMiss Longstaff is believed to be in a relationship with electrician Craig Rayment, who she met after moving to Torrequebrada, near Malaga, Spain, in summer 2016.Mr Rayment turned 43 while the Norwegian Star was at sea on a tour which took in Kotor, Dubrovnik, Santorini and other Greek Islands, before returning to port in Venice on Sunday afternoon.Miss Longstaff’s 76-year-old father said the air hostess had been through a distressing period recently, but would not elaborate.Mr Longstaff, a retired police superintendent from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, added: ‘She’s (been) going through a very hard time. She wouldn’t want to be upsetting me and of course she is.’ He added that he was pleased he had not found out that his daughter had fallen overboard until after she had been saved.A source with knowledge of the rescue operation said: ‘She had hypothermia and a haematoma on her right cheek from where she hit the water. It has been officially recorded as an accident, she has taken responsibility for not being careful enough.‘It was at the very moment that she thought she wouldn’t survive, that was when the boat arrived to save her.’Miss Longstaff spent Sunday night at Pula General Hospital for observations and was reunited with Mr Rayment yesterday. Dr Irene Hrstic, medical director of the hospital, confirmed the patient had been checked for signs of stress after her ordeal.‘I’m so surprised that she is OK after being in the sea for ten hours,’ Dr Hrstic said.          Air hostess Kay Longstaff, 46, (centre blonde) from Cheltenham, who survived 10 hours in the sea and is believed to have jumped off a cruise ship after a drunken row with her boyfriend, sources say‘The main thing that can happen is acute stress that anyone can experience after a night in the sea. That’s why we’re observing her.‘The biggest danger in the sea is to be frozen and go unconscious or have a heart attack. Now she’s in a good psychiatric condition.’A source said of the reunion between Miss Longstaff and Mr Rayment: ‘It was emotional, full of love.’ The pair later left the hospital by a rear exit.Miss Longstaff had long harboured an ambition to live abroad and moved to Spain after growing tired of the British climate. She secured a job with private jet operator NetJets.Former Premier League footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger, Formula 1 drivers and the socialite Tamara Ecclestone are said to have been among the clients she has looked after.But three months after setting up home in Torrequebrada with her long-term boyfriend Luke Hopkins, Miss Longstaff dumped him after seven years – leaving the retail manager heartbroken. Maureen Hopkins told the Daily Mail her son, 45, had given up his job and sold his car in order to follow Miss Longstaff abroad, only for her to end the relationship after telling him: ‘I love you but I’m not in love with you.’Mrs Hopkins, who lives in Honeybourne, Worcestershire, added: ‘I was very fond of Kay. She broke my heart too when she ended things with Luke.‘I’ve been watching this drama on the news but even when I heard her name this morning it didn’t click that it was the Kay I knew. I’m just glad she survived.’Her son declined to comment yesterday.Miss Longstaff and Mr Hopkins had previously lived in a rented property in the Worcestershire village of Offenham – where neighbours said she struggled to adapt to quiet village life – and then Cheltenham.          Career-orientated Miss Longstaff grew up in Sutton Coldfield, outside Birmingham, and has a large extended family in the area. Pictured: with Craig RaymentA friend said Miss Longstaff, a former Virgin Atlantic stewardess, ‘loves to socialise and would never miss the opportunity for a night out or a drink’.But the source added: ‘She lost her mother to cancer when she was 14 or 15 and it affected her a lot.

Bennett, who reportedly lives with his parents and sister in Huntington Beach, California, also plays guitar and sings on his YouTube channel.Argento\u0027s lawyer Carrie Goldberg sent a letter Argento in April setting out the final details of the settlement, she appeared to console the actress. \u0027We hope nothing like this ever happens to you again,\u0027 Goldberg wrote. \u0027You are a powerful and inspiring creator and it is a miserable condition of life that you live among shitty iniduals who\u0027ve preyed on both your strengths and your weaknesses.\u0027A month prior to Bennett\u0027s notice, The New Yorker published its bombshell expose featuring 13 women who accused Weinstein of harassment and rape.Among those 13 was Argento.The Italian star  told the New Yorker that Weinstein raped her in 1997 at a party hosted by Miramax at the Hotel Du Cap-Eden-Roc. She claims the mogul led her to an empty room and asked her to give him a massage.          Argento posted multiple photos of Bennett, and the two of them together on the day of the alleged assault, with fawning captions where she refers to him as her \u0027son\u0027  Bennett (pictured in recent Instagram photos) claimed his career as an actor had been stymied by the emotional distress he suffered           Argento was dating celebrity chef and writer Anthony Bourdain until his suicide in June (pictured together in September last year)\u0027When I see him, it makes me feel little and stupid and weak,\u0027 said Argento. \u0027After the rape, he won.\u0027In total, 13 women told the New Yorker that they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein and three said that they were raped.The explosive expose empowered dozens more women to come forward and share their allegations of assault, rape and harassment against Weinstein.The film producer, who was fired from Miramax in the wake of the allegations, turned himself into police in May on multiple rape charges.\u0027Today Harvey Weinstein will take his first step on his inevitable descent to hell. We, the women, finally have real hope for justice,\u0027 Argento tweeted as Weinstein turned himself in.  Weinstein has \u0027unequivocally denied\u0027 all allegations of non-consensual sex. The 66-year-old disgraced movie mogul was arrested, processed and booked for the alleged sexual assault of two women who previously shared their stories with the New Yorker back in October.in June, he plead not guilty to charges of sexual assault and rape.Argento\u0027s boyfriend Bourdain had been very supportive and was full of praise for the actress for initially going on record about her Weinstein rape allegations. \u0027When you went on record, @AsiaArgento you were sure this day would never come, that you would be crushed, that you were alone. And yet you did it anyway. #perpwalk,\u0027 he tweeted in May.Bourdain, 61, and Argento met during the filming of his travel show Parts Unknown in 2016 and began dating a year later. Shortly before he was found hanged in his French hotel room, a paparazzi caught Argento dancing in a Roman restaurant with French reporter Hugo Clément. They were also pictured holding hands and hugging on the streets of Rome.Bourdain committed suicide on June 8, five days after the photos first appeared online. Argento\u0027s friend and fellow Weinstein accuser, Rose McGowan, released a statement after his death, saying that the couple were in a \u0027free relationship\u0027 and \u0027loved without the borders of traditional relationships.\u0027Argento was devastated by Bourdain\u0027s death and released a heartbreaking statement following his suicide, where she described him as \u0027my love, my rock, my protector.\u0027\u0027I am beyond devastated. Anthony gave all of himself in everything that he did,\u0027 she wrote on Twitter. \u0027His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/09/4F3B035E00000578-0-image-m-14_1534753980744.jpg","title":"Britain 21st century exporting superpower Brexit","story":"    The International Trade Secretary, Liam, Fox, urges the country to \u0027set its sights high\u0027 as he outlines a strategy to boost the sales of domestic goods and services overseasIn a speech to a business audience in London today about the export strategy, he is expected to say: \u0027UK businesses are superbly placed to capitalise on the rapid changes in the global economic environment and I believe the UK has the potential to be a 21st century exporting superpower. As an international economic department, we are determined to support, connect and grow UK companies on the world stage through our international network.Property asking prices slump £7k in a month and expert says...FTSE CLOSE: Mulberry blames House of Fraser for £3m profits...Share this article\u0027As we leave the EU, we must set our sights high and that is just what this export strategy will help us achieve.\u0027Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Government\u0027s export strategy is \u0027strong on aspiration\u0027 and welcomed the commitment to increase exports as a proportion of GDP and other measures which could support small firms.He added: \u0027Incentives like export vouchers and grants should be made available to small businesses to help them with upfront investment costs for things like translation services or additional market research.

Shops on once booming boulevards are shuttered, while cranes stand idle over the shells of unfinished buildings and much of Athens is covered in ugly graffiti. Even the awnings around Greece’s most revered ancient site the Parthenon, home of the Athenian Acropolis, is covered in unsightly painted scribbles and drawings.At least ten hikers are killed with more missing as...Trump attacks Dems and Cuomo as he calls ICE agents heroes -...Share this articleThe hardships and deprivations I encountered during my recent visit were everywhere – and all the more heart-breaking in that they had been caused by European leaders who were masquerading as people bearing gifts.Take Maria, a cheerful, close friend of my family who spent years studying fine art and the science of paper conservation including a period at the prestigious Smithsonian museums in Washington. Today, she struggles to make ends meet.To help pay her way she spends almost every waking hour using scrap paper to hand-make table decorations for Greek weddings. The burden of work means that she is only able to visit her ageing parents, some four hours travel time from Athens, two or three times a year.A hospital doctor among our acquaintances has seen his monthly pay cut to €1,200 (£1,071). It is only his social conscience and love of his country that has kept him in Athens.          The country’s once elegant capital has become one of the most depressing and untidiest cities in Western Europe Some 70,000 highly skilled professionals including doctors, dentists and pharmacists have left the country as part of a broader Grexodus of 500,000 people.The best way for any country to emerge from financial crisis is to increase its national income so that tax revenues rise and global debts can be paid off. But during the last eight years, Greece has moved in precisely the opposite direction. National output has slumped by an astonishing 25 per cent. The result is adult unemployment of 20 per cent. Even more shocking and socially disruptive, some 40 per cent of 18 to 25-year olds are out of work.Without any income for the young, it is now commonplace for three generations of the same family to be forced to live cheek by jowl in the same crowded apartment. The fact is that the austerity imposed by the eurocrats has ruined Greece and done nothing to relieve it of its monstrous level of debt.It has snuffed out entrepreneurship, as well as created a poisonous political legacy where a far-Left Marxist party headed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rules with the support of fanatical politicians on the populist Right.The end of the EU’s bailout programme may technically mean that Greece can return to the international markets to borrow again, but any notion that the world’s commercial bankers and financiers will be queuing at Athens’ overcrowded and dilapidated airport to lend – and pour good money after bad – is a fantasy.          Shops on boulevards are shuttered and cranes stand idle over the shells of unfinished buildings (pictured, Greek riot police dodge a petrol bomb thrown by protesters during clash  over tax reforms in 2016) After all, the country is still sitting on a debt pile of €289billion (£258billion) which the International Monetary Fund puts at 191 per cent, or almost twice the nation’s total annual output.To place that in context, it is more than two times the ratio of Britain’s national debt to output, which after a decade of UK cuts to public services and surging tax incomes as the economy has grown is now, thankfully, on a downward path.Not only that, Greece’s stricken financial system is currently being kept afloat by short-term cash assistance of some €40billion (£35.6billion) per month from the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank. Without this help, which is akin to that provided by the Bank of England to the British banks at the height of the financial crisis a decade ago, the four biggest Greek lenders would be effectively bankrupt.Together the bad loans on the books of these banks – Piraeus, Alpha, Euro Bank and National Bank of Greece – amount to €101billion (£90billion) or 50 per cent of the total, the highest level of any country in the European Union. Indeed the banks, the lifeblood of any Western economy, are so indebted they cannot lend any more.Which means the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the country’s business bedrock cannot get the finance they need to carry on and invest. Nor do ordinary consumers find it possible to obtain credit.This desolate financial scenario is a direct result of the austerity conditions demanded by Brussels eurocrats and German central bankers.Over the last eight years successive Greek governments have been forced to attend no fewer than 95 meetings at which the most stringent measures have been imposed on them.The results for the Greek people have been nothing short of catastrophic.Yet in their determination to preserve the greater political project of the eurozone and the EU, and to keep Greece as their client state, Brussels and German politicians have been utterly ruthless.In spite of personal appeals from the International Monetary Fund’s euro-supporting managing director Christine Lagarde to forgive Greece its debt burden and allow the country to be given a fresh start, the eurofanatics have been unrelenting in their determination to keep the debt anvil hanging around its neck.Greece is in an armlock it cannot escape because of a combination of its debt burden and the fact that its membership of the eurozone means it can no longer devalue its currency. And the EU and Germans are determined to keep it that way to save their precious euro.So despite the joyous news bulletins about the bailout yesterday morning, be in no doubt that this Greek tragedy is very far from over."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/14/4F3C901200000578-0-image-m-40_1534773329152.jpg","title":"Party loving past tangled love life ship plunge Briton Kay Longstaff","story":"    Kay Longstaff had recently been through a ‘hard time’ in her personal life before her cruise ship ordeal, her father said last nightDid she jump? Crew question how British passenger who was...Three people are hurt in shooting outside London Tube...Share this article    Kay Longstaff, an ex air hostess, said to have allegedly jumped from the shipPassengers had previously said they were told the incident had been captured on the ship’s CCTV and showed that Miss Longstaff was on her own when she went over the edge.The Italian authorities appeared to corroborate that yesterday, when they said she ‘most likely jumped’ after apparently rowing with her boyfriend.‘Officers spoke with the woman’s partner on the ship when it arrived in Venice,’ a spokesman told The Sun. ‘The footage has been viewed and you can clearly see she was there on her own when she fell.‘The boyfriend said they had been drinking and they had quarrelled. He went back to his cabin and left her. The next thing he knew he was woken by the crew to say they thought she was missing as they had found her bag and belongings.’By then, the ship – which had been heading back to Venice – had doubled back on itself to search for her.A spokesman for the Croatian ministry of maritime affairs said that by checking CCTV rescuers knew the exact moment Miss Longstaff fell in the water. ‘Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship,’ he said.One passenger said a concierge had claimed Miss Longstaff and her boyfriend had been arguing prior to her disappearance, while another said: ‘When getting off the boat, seven hours late, a number of passengers were saying there had been a midnight dispute among the Longstaff party.’          Three months after setting up home in Torrequebrada with her long-term boyfriend Luke Hopkins (pictured), Miss Longstaff dumped him after seven years – leaving the retail manager heartbrokenMiss Longstaff is believed to be in a relationship with electrician Craig Rayment, who she met after moving to Torrequebrada, near Malaga, Spain, in summer 2016.Mr Rayment turned 43 while the Norwegian Star was at sea on a tour which took in Kotor, Dubrovnik, Santorini and other Greek Islands, before returning to port in Venice on Sunday afternoon.Miss Longstaff’s 76-year-old father said the air hostess had been through a distressing period recently, but would not elaborate.Mr Longstaff, a retired police superintendent from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, added: ‘She’s (been) going through a very hard time. She wouldn’t want to be upsetting me and of course she is.’ He added that he was pleased he had not found out that his daughter had fallen overboard until after she had been saved.A source with knowledge of the rescue operation said: ‘She had hypothermia and a haematoma on her right cheek from where she hit the water. It has been officially recorded as an accident, she has taken responsibility for not being careful enough.‘It was at the very moment that she thought she wouldn’t survive, that was when the boat arrived to save her.’Miss Longstaff spent Sunday night at Pula General Hospital for observations and was reunited with Mr Rayment yesterday. Dr Irene Hrstic, medical director of the hospital, confirmed the patient had been checked for signs of stress after her ordeal.‘I’m so surprised that she is OK after being in the sea for ten hours,’ Dr Hrstic said.          Air hostess Kay Longstaff, 46, (centre blonde) from Cheltenham, who survived 10 hours in the sea and is believed to have jumped off a cruise ship after a drunken row with her boyfriend, sources say‘The main thing that can happen is acute stress that anyone can experience after a night in the sea. That’s why we’re observing her.‘The biggest danger in the sea is to be frozen and go unconscious or have a heart attack. Now she’s in a good psychiatric condition.’A source said of the reunion between Miss Longstaff and Mr Rayment: ‘It was emotional, full of love.’ The pair later left the hospital by a rear exit.Miss Longstaff had long harboured an ambition to live abroad and moved to Spain after growing tired of the British climate. She secured a job with private jet operator NetJets.Former Premier League footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger, Formula 1 drivers and the socialite Tamara Ecclestone are said to have been among the clients she has looked after.But three months after setting up home in Torrequebrada with her long-term boyfriend Luke Hopkins, Miss Longstaff dumped him after seven years – leaving the retail manager heartbroken. Maureen Hopkins told the Daily Mail her son, 45, had given up his job and sold his car in order to follow Miss Longstaff abroad, only for her to end the relationship after telling him: ‘I love you but I’m not in love with you.’Mrs Hopkins, who lives in Honeybourne, Worcestershire, added: ‘I was very fond of Kay. She broke my heart too when she ended things with Luke.‘I’ve been watching this drama on the news but even when I heard her name this morning it didn’t click that it was the Kay I knew. I’m just glad she survived.’Her son declined to comment yesterday.Miss Longstaff and Mr Hopkins had previously lived in a rented property in the Worcestershire village of Offenham – where neighbours said she struggled to adapt to quiet village life – and then Cheltenham.          Career-orientated Miss Longstaff grew up in Sutton Coldfield, outside Birmingham, and has a large extended family in the area. Pictured: with Craig RaymentA friend said Miss Longstaff, a former Virgin Atlantic stewardess, ‘loves to socialise and would never miss the opportunity for a night out or a drink’.But the source added: ‘She lost her mother to cancer when she was 14 or 15 and it affected her a lot. She has struggled to come to terms with it and I think it has led her to suffer from bouts of depression or anxiety.’A former neighbour added: ‘Kay was excited to get the job working on the private jets.‘She was on call a lot and had to fly off at the drop of a hat, but she said she wasn’t allowed to talk about the firm’s clients. I’m just amazed she has been through an ordeal like this. It’s not her time (to go), that’s for sure.’Career-orientated Miss Longstaff grew up in Sutton Coldfield, outside Birmingham, and has a large extended family in the area.Relatives contacted by the Mail yesterday said she did not keep in touch often.The high-flyer once turned down a boyfriend’s proposal of marriage and told friends she was not interested in settling down or having children – with her only tie being a pet hamster she keeps at her Spanish residence.An expatriate friend had been detailed to feed the animal while Miss Longstaff was away. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab7e28c14bf25f6cd8aa2bb3e3a269f7a5bfc0ac/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1374b6f4c9da71995b546446a923e78","title":"beyonce botticelli tabloid photos art history","story":"The Twitter account Tabloid Art History juxtaposes celebrity shots with artworks they resemble. It’s a game that works because great art is universalBeyoncé poses with her twin babies. She is bedecked in flowers as she gazes emotionally into the heavenly distance. Do you spot the artistic echo? The creators of a Twitter account called TabloidArtHistory did. They juxtapose this photo with Botticelli’s Renaissance masterpiece Madonna of the Pomegranate. It is a beguiling match. Beyoncé’s maternal ecstasy mirrors Botticelli’s mystically beautiful Virgin Mary.Tabloid Art History delights in hilarious yet visually convincing collisions of high art and celebrity culture. Melania Trump giving Michelle Obama a gift is compared with a manuscript illumination of Christine de Pizan presenting her book The City of Women to Queen Isabeau and Géricault’s Romantic vision of despair, The Raft of the Medusa, is matched with a pic of The Real Housewives of New York slumped on the floor at an airport.Is this a lazy reduction of great works of art to the status of memes to snigger at? No, it’s a fresh and insightful way to look at art – and at life. We’re surrounded by great art all the time, these iconographic couplings reveal. Everyone is a statue or a painting, just waiting to be recognised. Harry Styles looks like an Egon Schiele self-portrait in a certain light. When Tyra Banks cupped her breasts to give contestants on America’s Next Top Model some career advice, she suddenly resembled Mary Magdalene in an altarpiece by Jan Polack.This game works because great art is universal. The gestures and expressions that artists such as Botticelli and Schiele saw in the world around them and distilled into sombre monumental images amount to a gallery of human possibility, a museum of moods, experiences and fates. All human life is in their masterpieces. So why is it surprising that Beyoncé looks for a moment like a Botticelli? He painted the way he did because he observed the street life around him with insight and truth. It’s no wonder today’s tabloid images and selfies occasionally throw up images of the same human truths.The creators of TabloidArtHistory – graduates Elise Bell, Chloe Esslemont and Mayanne Soret – have hit on the democratising magic that often eludes curators of old-master art collections. By presenting art with humour and humanity, they have unlocked the marble prison that can make it seem remote. The sweet melancholy dreaminess of Botticelli’s Madonna of the Pomegranate is relevant to all people in all times. If we need to see it next to a photograph of Beyoncé to recognise that – all power to the memes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e20fc68dd3a5d95a256fb0a39966ed823dfd6d71/157_18_2810_1766/master/2810.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c13353c95a4a5bbf6d028509f62a0ffc","title":"jewels in the night sea exhibition in pictures","story":"Ryo Minemizu, one of Japan’s emerging stars in the field of marine life photography and the 2017 winner of the Nikkei National Geographic photography prize, captures the beauty and complexity of plankton that drift in our planet’s oceans and other bodies of water in meticulous detail"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de29213d4166e177238815f15dd019abbf0d5328/0_963_8195_4918/master/8195.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d3683f1b75d686ce42bb9ff99f7773","title":"the mum who invented an sos watch to help young children play freely","story":"After witnessing another mother worry about a child who’d gone astray, Colleen Wong was inspired to create the Gator Watch to keep parents in touch with kids too young for smartphonesColleen Wong was on holiday when she had her big idea. At Bocketts Farm in Surrey, she was minding her one-year-old and newborn baby when another mother came running past, frantically searching for her more mobile six-year-old. He had wandered off on his own, no one knew where he’d got to, and there was no way to contact him. Wong thought: “Why can’t we be more connected to our younger children?”Enter the Gator Watch, a wearable tracking device with call functionality for kids who are too young for a smartphone but old enough to want a little more independence. Wong had researched her idea and found that while there were similar products already on the market in other countries, such as China, there was nothing quite like this. And nothing at all in the UK: the market was desperate for something that filled this communication gap for five- to 10-year-old children. “When I talk to parents, everyone is in agreement,” says Wong. “No one wants to give their kid a smartphone before secondary school, they just feel there’s nothing in the market for what they want, which is pure connection.”The watch can make and receive calls from 13 trusted numbers, it has an SOS button, and if your child wanders beyond defined safe zones you’re alerted as it happens. After eight months working with a manufacturer, Wong brought the watch to market, and this year her company, Techsixtyfour, which is staffed by working mums, won the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award for the Staying Independent with Tech Challenge. The category was set up to discover technologies that facilitate monitoring and emergency contact between caregivers and their charges.Last Christmas, Dave Housley bought the watch for his son Freddie, an eight-year-old kart-racing driver who spends a lot of time travelling to and from races: clocking up hundreds of miles is not an unusual way to spend a weekend for the Housley family. “At a kart race weekend, the kids are outside, they’re playing in the woods and doing stuff that kids should do. With this watch, we’ve got more confidence to let them do that because we can track them and we can get hold of them. It gives us a lot more confidence to let a kid be a kid in today’s world it gives you more confidence in letting them out of your sight.” The watch fulfils Housley’s need to know his son is safe, and it also works for Freddie. “He loved the whole concept of it,” says Housley. “It has that element of fun to it. He’s talking into it like it’s a James Bond watch.”The device has been a roaring success, and not only for reasons Wong predicted. It was always her plan to have the watch disconnected from the internet and social media, simply because she felt children should be able to have a childhood away from the glow of screens. But it wasn’t until she heard a policeman’s feedback that she realised it was solving a much bigger, and newer, societal problem.“He had bought the watch for his eight-year-old daughter because they live on an estate, and he was just afraid for his daughter to go outside,” she says. “But as a police officer, he knows that it’s far more dangerous for a child to stay at home and play on their screens. Parents might fear that allowing their children to go outside would mean they’d get kidnapped, but the amount of danger online is actually far higher – that parents are getting this wrong has been an eye-opener.”Wong has also found another vital use for the Gator Watch: helping older people. Ingrid Ehrlich’s husband, now 85, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago. “A year and a half ago he went for the newspaper,” says Ehrlich. “He did it every morning, and one day he didn’t come back. It was an hour before he went into the newsagent and bought the paper. Nobody can find out what he did in that hour.”Since getting the watch, Ehrlich has stopped locking the doors of the house in case her husband wanders off. He comes and goes as he pleases, while she monitors a map on her computer. “It’s the only thing he does on his own, so I encourage it. He just feels that he has much more freedom.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

That will be just the start of the revolutionJeremy Hunt does not come across as a man much burdened by the need to believe things with consistency. The foreign secretary rose to cabinet rank under David Cameron and wears his Conservatism in the style of that era: casually, with a liberal streak on top and not much underneath. He backed membership of the European Union in 2016, but had a change of heart last year. This was provoked, Hunt said, by exposure to “the arrogance of the European Commission”. The requirements of Euroscepticism in any aspiring Tory leadership candidate may also have featured in his journey.But admission to the club of Brexit believers is not easily won. Last week, Hunt upset Conservative backbenchers by saying that failure to strike a deal with the EU “would be a mistake we would regret for generations”. This statement was only remarkable because it was true. The foreign secretary quickly fixed that. Of course Britain would prosper in a no-deal scenario, he clarified with a cringe. The mistake would be Europe’s, as would the regret.A revealing feature of that episode was the Brexit fundamentalists’ refusal to recognise the foreign secretary’s conversion to their creed. “We don’t need any lectures from remainers,” said Nigel Evans, a Tory MP associated with Leave Means Leave – a campaign group that dissolves the boundary between the Conservative party and a harder rightwing fringe.The bullying of Hunt contains a challenge to those Tories who voted remain, but accept the referendum result and hope to find a sensible way to fulfil the mandate. It is a warning to those who just want to say it has been done and move on. The message is that Brexit is not that kind of project at all. It is not an agenda that can be adopted pragmatically because pragmatism runs against the spirit of the thing. Pragmatists like Hunt expose themselves as unbelievers. They accept Brexit with their heads, but they haven’t accepted it into their hearts. A majority of Tory MPs fail this test. Before the referendum, most were Eurosceptic in a loose, cultural sense. That was usually a condition of their selection as parliamentary candidates. A little Brussels-bashing over dinner was reflex and routine. But few considered how Britain might actually sever the ties, nor what it might cost. When they did, most saw that it wasn’t worth it.Theresa May was in that category once, and the Brexit thought police will not let her forget it. From her first day in Downing Street she has felt the need to scrub away the stain of her remain vote. That is how she ended up negotiating from behind impossibly restrictive red lines. The prime minister’s commitment to take the UK out of the EU is proven beyond reasonable doubt. Yet it is a racing certainty that Jacob Rees-Mogg and his acolytes will one day declare that the milk and honey can’t flow because May’s faith was not strong enough. They will say that deep down, in her traitor’s heart, she was a remainer all along.Still many Tories believe their party can avoid a civil war. One model, privately discussed among MPs, involves bundling Britain over the Brexit finish line next March with a sketchy, provisional deal, based on May’s Chequers blueprint. The details can then be finessed in transition. This position is often associated with Michael Gove, who has not so much softened his Brexit theology as adapted it to the available implementation timetable. The idea is to make sure the legal bridges back to EU membership are burned on time. Then most people will lose interest, May can be thrown under a bus and the real work of disentanglement can proceed under a new leader.The potential appeal to hardliners is that this plan minimises the risk of an autumn crisis so vast that somewhere in the melee, Brexit is lost altogether. The appeal to the rest of the party is that it opens a window onto a world where they don’t have to talk about the EU any more. That is also a popular proposition beyond Westminster.But the Tory pragmatists are wrong to imagine thattheir agonies end and healing begins after Brexit. It is clear already from the rhetoric and behaviour of the radical leavers that getting out of the EU is barely the start. They are facing a culture war against liberalism and the pre-2016 norms of British democracy. Leave.EU, Nigel Farage’s referendum campaign vehicle, has morphed into an engine of generalised Trumpian malevolence and is encouraging supporters to join the Conservatives. Some Tories report the return of racists and cranks who stormed out over gay marriage five years ago. Conservative membership is around 120,000. The number of energetic activists is much lower. In many areas it is a frail shell, easily requisitioned by entryists.There are MPs who put their faith in a silent, sensible majority a hidden ballast ofstalwart, no-nonsense, old-fashioned Tories who might have reactionary views on social issues but who take their civic duties seriously and recoil from actual fascists. This bedrock of respectability is supposed to uphold the cause of pragmatism in any leadership contest. The danger is that this cohort is quiet not because that is their style, but because they aren’t there any more. If this sounds familiar it is because Conservative moderates are saying many of the same things that Labour MPs said when first confronted with Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership bid. Liberal Tories watched with condescending pity as their opposition counterparts were humiliated by a radical movement beyond parliament’s walls. They believed in British Conservatism’s immunity to capture by ideological extremes, even as they felt the tremors beneath their own benches. They fretted about Faragism in their midst but saw it as a passing storm, after which they might get their party back.They must now realise that nothing is just going to default back to the way it was. The options for reviving a liberal, one-nation school of Toryism are to fight the extremist takeover, or carry the flame elsewhere to a different party. Sitting tight, waiting until “after Brexit”, is an act of intellectual surrender amounting to political suicide. There is no “after Brexit” because the revolution can never be finished the old order cannot be allowed to survive. Nationalist vultures are already circling over the limp, motionless body of Tory moderation. If it doesn’t rouse itself and show some life, it will be picked to pieces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6702a386c1ed21533f02b93ca4fdd9669c183a9/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e30d4570255769ba274fe43021fb34e3","title":"urban walking save humanity understand cities","story":"It probably says something about me that, while I\u0026nbspretain no memory of the first time I successfully walked the 15 miles from central London to my childhood home in Essex, I remember my first failure in excruciating detail. It was late October, the week before I started my first proper\u0026nbspjob and, not then being in the habit of gainful employment, I got up late and accidentally didn’t\u0026nbspset out until the afternoon. Then I stopped for a lengthy coffee at Mile End, a district whose very name should have been a useful clue that I’d barely got started.\u0026nbspI eventually gave up, freezing and damp, in Ilford, a suburb that borders Romford, which, I\u0026nbspreasoned,\u0026nbspmeant I’d nearly made it. I hadn’t.I didn’t know it then, but that walk was an early symptom of a mania that was to gradually swallow up my free time. I’ve since done that route so often that I’ve grown bored with it – there’s only so much joy to be\u0026nbsphad from a long march through Chadwell Heath – but\u0026nbspI’ve branched out, walking the Thames and the Lea rivers, various tube lines and completing the assorted routes recommended by Transport for London. Once I’d exhausted those, I took to getting trains out to far-flung\u0026nbspstations and then simply walking back. I’ve done the same in other cities, too, walking aimlessly around the streets of Montreal and Manchester, Chicago and Coventry. I even tried walking in Doha, though I fear I may be the only person in the whole of human history to\u0026nbsphave attempted it, and I regretted it exactly as swiftly\u0026nbspas you’d think I would.Taking long, pointless walks is not an unusual hobby among the British. It’s a good way of clearing your head, of taking all the pieces of yourself and shuffling them back into the right order and, in the age of the smartphone, a good way of mainlining audiobooks to assuage the guilt about the way the internet has demolished your attention , too. The government even recommends it as the easiest way to get some exercise (although a recent report from Public Health England warned that if you want to stay properly fit you should supplement your walking by lifting weights or ballroom dancing. I’m sorry, but no).The received wisdom, though, is that the best walking\u0026nbspis done in the countryside, where the air is clean\u0026nbspand the views are dramatic. Walking in cities – especially the suburban or industrial quarters where I often end up, even if I don’t intend to – is less fashionable. Well: the received wisdom is wrong. Urban walking is better, and I’m willing to go head to head with\u0026nbspanyone who says otherwise.One reason is that, with the best will in the world, the countryside is boring. One field is very like another, and many of them are filled with cows which, though nobody likes to talk about it, have a nasty habit of killing people they take against. In a city, there’s more to see, and you’re less likely to get stamped on by a cow.Walking is the best way of getting to know a place, too. There’s only so much you can learn from behind the wheel of a car or the window of a train, zooming past things before you even notice them, and anyway, in\u0026nbspthose vehicles, you need a destination. On foot, though, you can wander: serendipity kicks in, and you find things you never even knew you were looking for. On one long walk, I discovered the world’s first municipal park in Birkenhead, the model for Central Park in New York. On another, I learned of the existence of St\u0026nbspVolodymyr, whose Christianisation of Kievan Rus is commemorated by a statue in Holland Park. This is not the sort of thing that you learn in a field.There’s another argument in favour of walking in cities, one that’s more about the city than the walker: cities that encourage walking are nicer. Not just less polluted, though that’s often true, but more interesting, too: a street with heavy footfall is a street that’s likely to attract the bars and cafes and other things that make a city worth living in, in exactly the way a dual carriageway won’t.There are many differences between Birmingham and Barcelona, at least some of which you can almost certainly\u0026nbspguess – but one which becomes blindingly obvious if you’ve spent any time walking the two is the scale on which they are built. Birmingham is built around the car, an industry from which it once made its living, and has a vaguely American tendency towards multi-lane highways and sprawl. Barcelona is tightly squeezed between mountains and coast, and its growth has been up rather than out. The weather is not the only reason why it’s the latter whose suburbs have the more\u0026nbspinteresting street life.And here’s one compelling argument for the superiority of urban\u0026nbspwalking: understanding cities matters, because they’re the place where many of our problems will ultimately be solved.I’ve wondered sometimes if the trend to favour walking in rural areas over urban ones is another element of that broader tendency to treat the world outside its cities as somehow more “real”. I doubt this was ever true, but with more than half the planet today living in urban areas, it’s actively ridiculous now. And, as more of the world’s population migrates to its cities, they’ll account for an ever-growing share of problems such as inequality and carbon emissions, too.But the flipside to this is that more and more of humanity’s problems will be solvable by making our cities work better. And the first step towards doing that\u0026nbspis to understand how they work.I’m not saying walking 15 miles out into Essex is enough to magically achieve that. But it’s a damn sight\u0026nbspmore use than a hike across the Chilterns.• Jonn Elledge is the editor of the New Statesman’s cities site, CityMetric"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8c00e5681fe7aea730be2213e9f78af2eb2559/52_140_2897_1739/master/2897.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49c867609a5fad4275b0b4890453223d","title":"how we made musical youth pass the dutchie","story":"‘We met Michael Jackson’s snake, made a film with Mr T, and were the first black band to be interviewed on MTV. It was a relief to get back to school’We were all still schoolkids in Birmingham when the band was formed. Patrick and Freddie “Junior” Waite’s dad was a reggae musician and he taught us how to play. He also sang on our first two songs, Political and Generals, but when the tracks were played by DJ John Peel, music industry people said: “You can’t have an old geezer singing if you’re called Musical Youth.” So I became the lead singer, aged 11. The chap who signed us to MCA told us the company laughed at him for signing schoolboys.We played reggae hits and some of our own songs, mostly in West Indian working men’s clubs. When we played the Mighty Diamonds’ song Pass the Kouchie at Heaven in London while supporting Culture Club, 3,000 people went crazy. It was a song about a big marijuana bong, so the record company asked us to do something about the lyrics. We changed kouchie to dutchie, which is a West Indian cooking pot, and switched “How does it feel when you’ve got no herb?” to “got no food”. Kelvin Grant, who played guitar, added the rapping.When we recorded the song, we couldn’t play it short enough for a seven-inch single, so the producer cut the tape and spliced it back together. Don Letts made a video of us by the Thames in which a truancy officer chases us, trying to get us into school. The song went to No 1 and sold 5m copies worldwide. After it reached the top 10 in America, we went to Michael Jackson’s house. He had a chimp called Bubbles and a snake called Muscles, which slithered around his room. He told us Muscles, the track he wrote for Diana Ross, was about the snake. We made a film with Mr T in Hollywood and were the first black band to be interviewed on MTV. In a way, it was a relief to get back to school and restore some normality.Because we were so young, we were only allowed to work 42 days a year, which scuppered our career. It took 18 years to see any money. I’m a health and safety professional now. I miss hanging out with my friends, but I’m proud that Michael Grant and I have kept playing. When we do 80s-themed festivals, I’m still the youngest performer there.We were exposed to sex, drugs and rock’n’roll at the age of 13. We saw things like DJs putting their hands down women’s tops – they’d be sacked on the spot today. Not all of us succumbed to the various temptations, though. If you start taking drugs at that age, you’re not going to be around for long.Patrick, our bass player, was a really quiet, lovely guy. You’d think butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth. Sadly, he ended up doing all sorts of craziness and died of a heart condition when he was 24. His brother Freddie, our drummer, couldn’t handle fame – nor the pressure when success stopped. He started having mental problems and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. The last time I saw him, he asked me: “Where’s Patrick?” It broke my heart. Patrick died broke and we’ve had court battles over Pass the Dutchie. We didn’t get songwriting credits, even though we’d changed the lyrics and the arrangement. Years later, the record company settled with us and we got some money. I don’t feel hard done by, though, as the highs outweighed the lows. I met Michael Jackson, Paul and Linda McCartney, James Brown, Prince and Donna Summer. We did things a kid could only dream of. At one point, I was jamming with Stevie Wonder in his Wonderland studio.Back then, I was too young to buy cars or houses. All I wanted was a BMX Super Burner bike. When the record company dropped us, I asked the accountant: “Does this mean I’ll have to sell my bike?” He told me: “No. You can keep your bike.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a984762c27f047cdd85b9e224a29464d370657bc/0_0_3500_2330/master/3500.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fb364b5b41041690ab2194aaed8b398 1010w","title":"2018 bird photographer of the year in pictures","story":"Pedro Jarque Krebs from Peru scoops the top prize of £5,000 for his vibrant image of American Flamingos preening"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700834ac21a5e25e4cf7a3183991a8fd4e08ac7a/0_196_3636_2181/master/3636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec75c0080f41e9d8859750b9337e9fd3","title":"asia argento accused paying off actor metoo weinstein jimmy bennett","story":"The actor and #MeToo campaigner – who accused Harvey Weinstein of rape – reportedly paid $380,000 last year to former co-star Jimmy Bennett One of the most prominent activists of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment recently settled a complaint filed against her by a young actor and musician who said she sexually assaulted him when he was 17, the New York Times reported. Asia Argento, 42, settled the notice of intent to sue filed by Jimmy Bennett, who is now 22, for $380,000 shortly after she said last October that movie mogul Harvey Weinstein raped her, the Times reported.Argento and Bennett co-starred in a 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, in which Argento played Bennett’s mother.Bennett says in the notice that he had sex with Argento in a California hotel in 2013. The age of consent in California is 18. The notice says the encounter traumatised Bennett, affected his mental health and damaged his career, the Times reported.The notice claims that Bennett arrived at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey to meet Argento in her hotel room on 10 May 2013, with a family member. Argento asked to be alone with Bennett and the family member left. Bennett claims Argento gave him alcohol before proceeding to kiss him and perform oral sex before having intercourse with him. The documents say that Argento then asked to take a number of photos with him. Photos of Argento and Bennett semi-clothed in bed, as well as an Instagram post of their faces taken on that day, were included in the notice of intent to sue. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic, the Times reported.Argento became one of the most well-known activists of the #MeToo movement after she told the New Yorker magazine that Weinstein raped her at the Cannes film festival in 1997 when she was 21. Argento told the magazine that she continued to have a relationship with Weinstein because she was afraid of angering him.Weinstein has been indicted on sex crime accusations involving three women, but not including Argento. He denies all charges of non-consensual sex. Since the Weinstein allegations became public, Argento has spoken out about sexual harassment both in Hollywood and her home country of Italy and given high-profile talks on the subject at Harvard University and at the Cannes film festival. The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things was directed by Argento and based on the novel by JT LeRoy. In the film, she plays a drug-taking prostitute struggling to care for her young son, played by Bennett, who is raped by one of her boyfriends. Her character persuades her son to cross-dress and act as an increasingly seductive “little sister”. Writing on Twitter in the wake of the New York Times report, Rose McGowan – who has also accused Weinstein of assault – wrote that her “heart is broken”.  has reached out to Argento for comment, but at the time of publication had not received a response.

He then filmed a ceremony in a Greek Orthodox church in Los Angeles with a real priest. “This is pretty authentic and I think very beautiful, because we actually did the ceremony and had the priest do the ceremony.,” Coppola said. “So in a sense, when we were all done, we realised that Keanu and Winona really are married as a result of this scene and this ceremony.”Footage of the ceremony is spliced in the film with the death of a friend, who has been turned into a vampire.

Crystal Palace, always awkward opponents, were eventually seen off in south London to maintain the Merseysiders’ pristine start to the campaign and leave their manager chest-bumping his coaching staff as he celebrated on the sidelines. They have plenty of cause for optimism.This was never comfortable, even after the home side had been reduced in number after the otherwise excellent Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s right knee illegally thwarted Mohamed Salah’s counterattack on the edge of the Palace penalty area with a quarter of an hour still to play. It was also controversial inasmuch as the home side were incensed at Michael Oliver’s award of a penalty as half-time approached, even if Mamadou Sakho’s stuttered and desperate lunges at the loose ball might have done enough to send Salah to the turf. Roy Hodgson, usually loath to criticise officials, was still seething at that award long after the final whistle.Yet the victory ultimately served as an indication of Liverpool’s new-found prowess. In Virgil van Dijk they boasted the dominant defensive force on display, a colossus who matched and, mostly, dwarfed Christian Benteke in the air, with each tackle, interception or booming header a source of inspiration for his teammates. He certainly brought the best out of Joe Gomez at his side. The last time this team had visited Selhurst Park on a Monday night, in May 2014, they had retained vague hopes of claiming the title in a campaign’s death throes, only to capitulate dismally and ship a three-goal lead in the bedlam of the latter stages. With Van Dijk in their ranks, the current crop should never suffer such indignity.Then, at the Dutchman’s back, there was Alisson who, when an aggrieved Palace stirred after the interval in pursuit of parity, was imposing where previous Liverpool goalkeepers have merely wilted away. The Brazilian simply did what was required of him, but few of his recent predecessors have managed even that much.He ed to thwart Luka Milivojevic’s free-kick, flopped down on Benteke’s rare header, and was only bypassed by Andros Townsend’s attempt from distance that bruised the bar and a few fizzed centres across his six-yard box. This defence will have thrilled at a clean sheet thoroughly well earned.Given the thrashing inflicted by Manchester City on Huddersfield the previous day, and the relatively innocuous look to the schedule at the start of the champions’ title defence, Klopp’s team could ill afford any kind of slip here. He could bemoan the lack of rhythm in too much of their attacking play, and pinpoint his full-backs for failing to inject the required zest to their approach work, but they still retained bite. Their counterattacking always felt fluent and incisive. Witness Naby Keïta’s spin away from Townsend deep inside his own half, then run and lofted pass beyond Sakho to send Salah bearing down on goal.The Egyptian’s attempt was too heavy on that occasion, and ballooned over the bar, but he would still be decisive in each of Liverpool’s rewards. Hodgson was incensed by his first involvement, Roberto Firmino having slipped him into the box for Salah to hurdle Sakho’s initial panicked challenge – there appeared to be contact at that point – and the centre-half’s second stretch in vain for the ball, before crumpling to the turf.“It’s not a penalty,” offered the Palace manager. “I’ve been in football a long time and, if that’s a penalty, then the game has changed beyond all recognition. There’s no way he’s looking to foul the player. He’s trying to defend. There’s no way he’s looking to get contact on the player himself.” James Milner, unperturbed amid the furore, converted regardless.Hennessey subsequently admitted the award had “destroyed us” even if the hosts were driven forward thereafter by a sense of grievance, with Wan-Bissaka a threat down the flank in front of the watching Gareth Southgate and Wilfried Zaha increasingly influential. Their pressure might have forced parity even after the young right-back’s dismissal, with the substitute Max Meyer going to ground at Van Dijk’s challenge as he attempted to convert Zaha’s low centre, but the sting in the tail was eventually supplied by the visitors.The Dutch centre-half rose to repel yet another Milivojevic corner and, with Palace having cluttered the box, Salah and Sadio Mané sprinted beyond Patrick van Aanholt and away into enemy territory. The Senegalese, holding off the full-back as he stumbled, duly rounded Hennessey to poke in his third of the new campaign with virtually the last touch of the night. “We have won pretty much all my games here, but it’s still always really difficult,” added Klopp. “I’m not interested in sending a statement to City or not. I’m interested in winning football games.” To that end, this was mission accomplished."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddc905a7a134c1c198bd2f89a9d5a9f67a0cb1d5/0_218_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71db8107200365766019ecb03dff6deb","title":"manchester united drift under jose mourinho","story":"In Manchester United’s ongoing insipidness under José Mourinho a perfect storm of problems is found.The manager seems to have lost his mojo – momentarily, at least. An elite group of players are underperforming and failing to take on-field responsibility. And in the Glazers the club has near‑anonymous proprietors whose preference for safety-first managers since Sir Alex Ferguson – Mourinho, David Moyes and Louis van Gaal – signals a muted ambition that aims for a Champions League berth rather than the title glory that might have them appointing an attack-first coach such as Pep Guardiola.For now Mourinho retains the backing of the Glazers, and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, following Sunday’s dismal 3-2 defeat at Brighton. Yet for the Portuguese’s future to be an issue after only two matches points to the sense of drift and makes any optimism he can engineer the kind of step-change Guardiola brought to his runaway champions across the city appear distant.Mourinho cannot argue he has not been backed in the market. The 10 frontline players recruited for £364.3m – before generous salaries are factored in – during his five transfer windows in charge is evidence. Paul Pogba (£89.3m), Romelu Lukaku (£75m), Nemanja Matic (£40m), Alexis Sánchez (swap), Fred (£55m), Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£30m), Victor Lindelöf (£31m), Eric Bailly (£25m), Diogo Dalot (£19m), and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) have walked through the door since Mourinho himself did just over two years ago.He also inherited 20 frontline players in summer 2016: David de Gea, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford, Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, Matteo Darmian, Antonio Valencia, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Memphis Depay, Wayne Rooney, Adnan Januzaj, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Chris Smalling, Juan Mata, Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Andreas Pereira and Anthony Martial.These lists offer a full picture of the footballers Mourinho has worked with since replacing Van Gaal.To scan the names is to provoke a glaring question: by now should Mourinho have created a genuine title-challenging unit and not one that can defeat Leicester City 2-1 on opening day and go down in powder-puff style at Brighton?The answer is surely yes. If in Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Depay, Rooney, Mkhitaryan, Ibrahimovic and Januzaj there is scant argument (for reasons of ability and age) regarding those Mourinho has allowed to depart, the 24-strong group – once the emerging Scott McTominay is added – he has to work with should allow a potent XI supported by strength in depth.Mourinho’s strongest team might read: De Gea Valencia, Bailly, LindelöfJones, Young Fred, Matic, Pogba Lingard, Lukaku, Sánchez and be backed by six outfield substitutes in Rojo, Shaw, Herrera, Fellaini, Mata and Rashford.On paper – where matches are never won, of course – it appears a formidable cadre, yet United continue to stumble.Blame must be split between manager and players. Mourinho’s forte is defence: in his two seasons United have conceded the second-lowest number of league goals – 29 and 28 – so the rearguard is of championship-contenders standard.If Mourinho can field an attack of Lukaku, Lingard and Sánchez, supported in midfield by the effervescent (on occasion) Pogba, metronomic Matic and dynamic Fred, as head coach, tactician and motivator the manager has to draw more from the team or United should consider employing somebody who can.Yet all professionals, particularly those who play for elite clubs, should be able to take charge of their own destiny too. The displays of Pogba versus Leicester and Brighton offer a microcosm of the travails under Mourinho.Against Leicester the midfielder drove the side supremely as a near-irresistible force. Against Brighton he was near-awful and left to reflect that “they had more hunger than us. I put myself first, my attitude was not right enough.”This sums up Pogba – and the side’s inconsistency – under Mourinho. And if the Frenchman’s erratic form continues to be a head-scratcher his manager becomes a bigger conundrum with each match.Mourinho has won eight domestic titles in four nations – Portugal, England, Italy and Spain. There is also a host of domestic cups, a Uefa Cup and the Europa League plus two Champions Leagues – with Porto and Internazionale, the latter bridging a 45-year gap for the club, as Mourinho landed the first treble in Italian football history.Yet the bounce of Mourinho in his first tenure at Chelsea (2004-07) and at Internazionale (2008-10) is glimpsed only rarely. In two years at United Mourinho has won the Europa League and League Cup (2016-17) and finished second in the Premier League and lost the FA Cup final (2017-18). But United remain a disjointed side. They are light years from the relentless City machine built by Guardiola, which before United’s humbling on the south coast was trouncing Huddersfield 6-1 at a relative canter despite missing Kevin De Bruyne.Mourinho has to take a share of responsibility or else why is he (or any manager) in position? Yet beyond his and the players’ collective culpability, questions have to be asked of the Glazers. To date none of their managerial appointments have worked. Mourinho may still do but the clock ticks on the time he may be allowed. If he does go, whom the owners turn to will reveal, again, how much a 21st top-ision title is really wanted.Victory over Tottenham next Monday night at Old Trafford and at Burnley before the international break would quieten the noise around Mourinho. But the deep fault-lines at the club may remain and manager and team may continue to struggle.Put it another way: transforming United into a real threat to City this season may be the greatest challenge of Mourinho’s so far gilded career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b134a293ce342b454e8a666b73adb1207dc59f6/0_104_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=148ad73eaad901279b224195e9379dd6","title":"ruben loftus cheek chelsea england maurizio sarri","story":"• England midfielder will stay and work with Maurizio Sarri• Crystal Palace and Schalke among clubs keen on loan dealChelsea have made clear to Ruben Loftus-Cheek that he will have opportunities to make his mark in the first team at Stamford Bridge this season and have reiterated their reluctance to sanction another loan move in what remains of the European transfer window.Loftus-Cheek, whose performances at Crystal Palace last season earned him a place in England’s World Cup squad, has been keen to prove himself back at his parent club this term but was dismayed to find himself omitted from Maurizio Sarri’s matchday squad for the win against Arsenal on Saturday. His non‑involvement for that game, after a cameo at Huddersfield on the opening weekend, had left the 22‑year‑old contemplating whether he would have to seek a loan move abroad before the end of the month.Although Loftus-Cheek was disappointed at his omission, Sarri and Chelsea have made clear they want the midfielder to fight for his place in the team and would only revisit a potential loan move away in January if he has failed to make an impact by then. They believe a player who remains highly rated at the club would benefit from working under Sarri at Cobham, rather than under another coaching regime elsewhere, and have effectively challenged him to force his way into the reckoning.Loftus-Cheek, now capped eight times, is understandably concerned he will lose his place in the England setup if he does not feature at club level with Gareth Southgate due to name his squad for the games against Spain next month and Switzerland on 30\u0026nbspAugust. Yet he has found himself further down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge since returning from his season at Palace.Chelsea secured the Real Madrid midfielder Mateo Kovacic on loan with no option to buy this month, with the Croatia international effectively taking Loftus-Cheek’s place on the bench against Arsenal, and have preferred Ross Barkley in midfield for the team’s first two Premier League games.Germany’s Schalke and clubs in France have expressed a desire to take him on loan, interest that the player knocked back, with Chelsea’s reluctance to let him leave likely now to frustrate any clubs in Spain before the closure of their window at the end of the month. If he stays until January and opportunities remain limited, Loftus-Cheek could then seek a move to a rival Premier League club. Palace, whose attempts to secure him for a second season were rejected, could potentially revive their own interest at that point.Chelsea, as per their club policy, would seek to secure him to a new long‑term contract if he does end up leaving on another loan but Loftus‑Cheek, whose current £60,000-a-week deal expires in 2021, is expected to resist committing his future further to the club given the doubts around his involvement. The England striker, Tammy Abraham, is interesting clubs in the Championship – including Aston Villa – having also failed to feature as yet this season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7750b93dc593a95553474e28a61579048790c7f1/0_0_1723_1034/master/1723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a29e37d2642a5781133c6bed1248dc3","title":"behind the times the strange sad story of rear of the year","story":"Britain is not a nation renowned for its bottoms. Californian bottoms are neat, clenched things, compacted in the dust of early-morning hikes. British behinds, by contrast, wobble: our national bottom is the builder’s bum, as patriotic as tea or the Queen. It is unusual, then, that every year the British public confers upon a celebrity the award of rear of the year.Launched by the PR consultant Anthony Edwards in 1976, rear of the year was initially awarded annually to the woman judged by the British public to have the nation’s most significant posterior. Over time, it has modernised, with Michael Barrymore becoming the first person to win the men’s trophy, in 1986 (although usually the press ignores the male recipients, who often don’t even get their own photocalls).In its own way, the award has become a barometer for how the nation feels about itself. Were we, deep in the lads’ mag era, qualm-free about sexualising children (Charlotte Church was 16 when she won in 2002)? Did the country’s warmth for Princess Diana lead to Princess Alexandra’s daughter, Marina Ogilvy, becoming the only royal to win, in 1999? In 2018, it seems we feel a bit weird about the whole thing. In these post-Weinstein, #MeToo times, it is hard to believe this ritualised objectification of a celebrity’s buttocks still exists. A cloud of uncertainty hangs over the rear of the year, so perhaps it is unsurprising that Edwards declines to meet in person, citing the pressure of his job, an overdue novel and “crucial activity in local green-belt politics” (he is campaigning to block plans to build new homes on a former airfield in Ockham, Surrey, where he lives). He agrees to a telephone interview, in which he talks about his published novels, including 2002’s Wilson Lacigam’s Bentley, a “tale of the coming of the messiah in the 21st century”, which is based on his experience of owning classic cars. Even on the phone, Edwards remains elusive, perhaps because he has not been charred by the fires of public outrage and wants to keep it that way: he will not disclose his age, he refuses to be photographed and he will not reveal when this year’s winner will be announced.The idea for rear of the year came to Edwards, he says, when he was contracted to promote a denim trade show at the Olympia exhibition centre in London in the 70s. He thought an accolade for the female rear would focus media attention on the back pocket of jeans, offering an opportunity to promote specific brands. Barbara Windsor won the inaugural award, wearing the now defunct denim brand Sloopy.Winners must be UK residents, in the public eye and, says Edwards, “the proud possessor of a potentially prize-winning gluteus maximus”. Fan clubs often marshall votes for the eventual winner: Edwards credits the wins of Daniel Radcliffe (2015), Carol Smillie (1998) and Denise van Outen (1999) to organised efforts. The winners are a mix of soap actors (John Altman, 2001 Ryan Thomas, 2008), reality TV contestants (Javine Hylton, 2006 Will Young, 2005), pop stars (Natasha Hamilton, 2003 Gary Barlow, 1997) and the odd wildcard (Alex Best, 2004 Tom Hiddleston, 2016).The British public is not above intrigue when it comes to picking winners. In 2006, the competition became embroiled in a public love triangle when Lembit Opik, then a Liberal Democrat MP, left his fiancee, the weather presenter Siân Lloyd, for 24-year-old Gabriela Irimia of pop duo the Cheeky Girls, best known for their 2002 hit Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum). Rear of the year voters showed solidarity with Lloyd by awarding her the following year’s trophy.Carol Vorderman is undoubtedly the supreme champion of rear of the year, being its only two-time recipient, with wins in 2011 and 2014. (“I always suspected there were a lot of people out there who were glad to see the back of me. It now appears there were even more than I thought,” Vorderman joked when she collected her second trophy.) “It would be nice to win it twice,” muses the glam rock musician Suzi Quatro, the winner in 1982, reflecting on Vorderman’s successes. “I’ve been told since I was about eight or nine that I had a nice ass,” she says. “Seriously. I remember staring at myself in the mirror, trying to figure out why people were saying that. It used to be written in critical reviews. People would talk about my backside and my leather suit. So, when I won the award, I was actually quite proud.”Victorious rumps change with the times, Edwards says. “Rear of the year is an excellent monitor of fashions in body shape. In 2018, the trend is towards a shapely, well-toned and, above all, proportionate rear.” Our fitness-focused paradigm was reflected in last year’s joint winner, Idris Elba, who has “a well-toned, firm rear”, Edwards explains. In the 40s and 50s, rear fashions were quite different. “If there had been a rear of the year award back then, it would have gone to Jane Russell or Marilyn Monroe.”Rear of the year has become famous mostly for its trashy-fabulous photocalls, which are a sort of visual metaphor for why Britain no longer occupies a position of prestige on the international stage. Typically, the recipient poses, back to camera, hands on hips, while a bank of photographers snap them. Photocalls appear to have been phased out in recent years, though, with the last person to attend being the soap actor Jennifer Metcalfe in 2016 (she thanked her mother for giving her a “small waist and big bum”). Does Edwards struggle to get winners to attend the photocalls? He claims not. There was no photocall last year, he says, because he had “other things to do”.The tabloids would not be happy to see the back of the competition: editors love the photocalls, Edwards says, because they get to print pictures of obliging women in tight outfits. “As one national photographer said to me recently: ‘You can rely on the rear of the year award. It delivers every time.’”Lloyd describes her shoot as “probably the weirdest photocall I’ve attended in my life”. “It was unbelievable. I felt like I was attending the Cannes film festival. The photographers were literally six-deep. I’m used to my face being photographed, but they want the back of you for the photo. Everything about it was really odd.”A talented extrovert may subvert these conventions, with joyous results. The Doctor Who actor John Barrowman’s high-camp photocall in 2012 was more naff than a Christmas panto, yet strangely, gloriously erotic. “Barrowman jumped in a fountain,” Edwards says. “Immediately, people were in the fountain with him, taking photographs, and there was this surge of interest – until the wind began to blow and he got a bit chilly and had to go change.”But not everyone thinks it is a bit of cheeky fun. The Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton was initially flattered to be named rear of the year, but that soon changed. “The title felt a bit tongue in cheek,” she says. “But when the reality kicked in, that I had to stand and have my picture taken, it felt uncomfortable. There was a wall of paparazzi taking my picture and I was only 20 and not really that comfortable in my own skin. I thought: ‘I don’t know how I feel about this.’” She “put on a mask and went along with it”. However, when the images appeared in the press, she was unhappy. “I just didn’t like it. It seemed a little bit crass and seedy. Maybe it was an age thing,” she says diplomatically. “I was just a bit too young for it.”Still, she never took her award out of its box. “I was given a plaque and I did have it for many years in a box on a shelf, in a back room. I never put it up.”Although Fiona Bruce, one of the 2010 winners, has publicly disavowed the trophy, describing her decision to accept it as “the most hypocritical, ridiculous, ludicrous thing I’ve ever done”, most of the winners I speak to regard rear of the year with a mixture of bafflement and good humour. “It’s one of the most democratic of all the awards,” Lloyd argues. “It’s not just your gorgeous-looking reality TV stars who win, but Carol Vorderman, who won at a ripe old age. Why should 21- or 22-year-olds always win these things?”How can we account for the continued popularity of the competition after so many years? Nearly 11,000 public votes were cast for 2017’s joint winners (Rachel Riley and Idris Elba). “I think that the British public – while supposedly a revolutionary lot – like continuity. When something has been going on a long time, it becomes endearing, like an elderly aunt,” Edwards says.Despite this, it is difficult to see a path forward for the competition. Although not without its charm, rear of the year feels to me like a product of a different era and one that is incongruous in these more feminist times. Edwards senses my mixed feelings and emails me a characteristically eccentric survey following our interview (“Now you’ve filed your copy, would you say it was: pro-ROTY, anti-ROTY, complimentary, scathing, humorous, serious, for framing on the office wall, food for the shredder, or a step-by-step guide to winning the 2019 trophy?”).Quatro, for one, would be disappointed if it ended. “It’s a one-off thing, isn’t it? It’s unique.” And much like Quatro’s bum (“It’s still good,” she says), it is possible that, despite all the challenges, there is life yet in rear of the year.

Sorting between these two categories is the odd genius, such as Natalie Halman. Three years ago, when she was 27, she launched the Facebook page Can I Breastfeed in It? Almost instantly, 1,000 women were showering each other with suggestions for high-street clothes you could gracefully get in and out of – playsuits, wrap dresses, deceptively simple vest tops – in order to breastfeed. Death to the public feed is a top you have to pull up, rather than pull down, thus exposing the rest of your body. This is a painful discovery to make on your own in public. Plus, you have just spent nine months pregnant and you wouldn’t mind looking slightly nice every now and then. “Suddenly you need to account for feeding access, how it fits on your new post-baby body and whether the material will hide baby-inflicted stains,” says Halman. “All that, alongside retaining a style that makes you feel like ‘you’, is not an easy task.”Even though a decade has passed since I last tried to feed another human with my body, it is compulsive reading, not so much for its inventive quest for more imaginative jersey knits (front-loading buttons are good, but stretch is better) as for the vignettes presented to the group – “Help, I’m going to be a bridesmaid in six weeks, still breastfeeding my one-year-old, but one of the other bridesmaids is seven months pregnant and doesn’t want to look fat, what can we wear that will suit both of us?” – hosed with helpfulness from across the country as women getdown to the brass tacks of checking stock at the relevant Sainsbury’s for one another. It is a bit like the earliest days of Mumsnet.Most importantly, the hegemonic shift they want to instill is that breastfeeding-friendly does not have to mean nursing wear.

I sobbed my way through Simple Minds’ Don’t You (Forget About Me) at the end of The Breakfast Club when I watched it for the first time aged 16, already thinking about all the friendships I was likely to leave behind and the boys I wouldn’t kiss. My diary was an attempt to hold on\u0026nbspto those memories in the only way I\u0026nbspknew how.US high school movies are my bread and butter – and the latest Netflix offering, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, is a positive progression of a genre that has been stilted by less exciting films in recent years, such as openly fattist The Duff (about high-school misfit Bianca, who believes she is the “designated ugly fat friend”) and Greta Gerwig’s Lady\u0026nbspBird, which, despite its attempts at subverting high-school romcom tropes by hamming up its early-00s kookiness, left me cold.To All the Boys ... focuses on a relationship between strong-willed Lara Jean Covey and her love interest, the adorable Peter Kavinsky, which develops from a make-believe affair, to make Peter’s ex-girlfriend jealous, and ends in a kiss. It is a wistful, charming film.It is not the perfect feminist fairytale. For someone like me, who went through school with a few snogs but nothing resembling a boyfriend, a narrative that centres on a beautiful white boy will always seem problematic. There are more important things than falling in love with a handsome man who reciprocates that love, such as falling in love with yourself. Men other than beautiful white ones deserve love stories, too.To All the Boys ... ’s characters are refreshingly uncompromising in their friendships and shows of sisterhood. It is one of the first movies of its calibre with a non-white protagonist, whose Korean heritage is referenced in small gestures and who tears down the racism of high-school movies past (take Long Duk Dong in John Hughes’s Sixteen Candles, for\u0026nbspwhom a gong is sounded every time he appears).That Jenny Han, the author of the books that became the movie, struggled to find a production company willing to keep Lara Jean’s character Asian–American, rather than make her white, is an even more compelling reason to keep on streaming.

Three mothers talk about the joy of finally having a baby long after it would once have been possibleTo celebrate reaching half a century, Gemma Barnes wrote a list of the 50 things she hoped to achieve. Topping it was an ambition that a few years ago would have seemed absurd: she wanted to have a baby. But two years on, Barnes is cuddling her eight-month-old daughter, and while that means most of the other 49 ambitions will have to wait, she is delighted to be a mother.Barnes’s situation is unusual, but she is certainly not alone. In June data published by the Office for National Statistics showed the number of births to 50-plus women has quadrupled over the last two decades, up from 55 in 2001 to 238 in 2016. During that period there were 1,859 births in the UK to women over 50, and 153 to women over 55. Flying the flag for older motherhood have been a host of celebrities, most recently actor Brigitte Nielsen who was 54 when her fifth child, a daughter named Frida, arrived this summer. US singer Janet Jackson gave birth in January, aged 50, to son Eissa. Perhaps most visible of all has been US Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was shot down in 2004. She gave birth earlier this year, also aged 50, and was photographed soon afterwards, protesting against Trump’s immigration policies while holding newborn Maile on her lap.At first, Barnes wasn’t sure whether she wanted to go down that route. “You want your baby to be yours. I was thinking, would she look like me? Would she have my nose? My hair colour? But the doctor started talking about how when you carry a baby you shape so much about his or her personality and behaviour during the pregnancy. I started to think that was right, and that carrying the child was very important.”Having made the decision to go ahead, there was an egg donor as well as a sperm donor to choose. “You do it all online and it seems a bit surreal, and yes, you do think you’re playing God. These two people will never meet, never know one another, and together their cells will create a baby – your baby. It felt a huge responsibility, especially as I was making decisions all on my own.”Philippa Hodgson, who is 58 and the mother of a four-year-old, was similarly unsure at first about whether to use an egg donor, but like Barnes went ahead when she realised it would give her the best chance of a baby. She had met her husband when she was 45 her daughter Roxanne was conceived using his sperm and a donor egg. “I was very shocked at first by the idea that we could use another woman’s egg,” she says. “I felt my child wouldn’t really be my own. But now she’s here I couldn’t love her more. Occasionally she does something that I don’t recognise as being connected to either my husband or myself and I think, how beautiful – that must be because of something in her genes from the donor.”Despite being reconciled to using a donated egg, though, neither Barnes nor Hodgson has told everyone in their lives about that element of their story, and nor has the third mother I spoke to, Carol, who is 61 and has children aged 13 and 10. (Barnes and Hodgson are pseudonyms Carol is happy to use her first name.) Carol’s feeling is that her decision to use an egg donor is not secret information, but it is private – and it would invade her children’s privacy to broadcast it to the world. All three women, incidentally, are entirely committed to telling their children how they were conceived. Hodgson says she talked to her little girl recently about it: “I told her that a kind lady gave me an egg because mummy couldn’t use her own eggs. And she replied, ‘You are my only mummy.’ I was gobsmacked.”All the same, some professionals working in the field of later-life pregnancy are concerned about what Nina Barnsley, director of the Donor Conception Network, which supports families with children born as a result of donated gametes, describes as a “fog” around the subject, because so few women feel able to be open about egg donation: “It’s still a taboo. Many older mothers feel they are up against it enough in terms of other people’s views, and being open about this would be something else to criticise them for.” Celebrities, meanwhile, are often coy about the precise details of how they conceived, giving rise to the misconception that young people can postpone pregnancy until their sixth decade. “As a society we need to have a proper conversation,” says Barnsley. “The technology means it’s possible to have babies until we’re 75 – but is that what we want?”Adam Balen, professor of reproductive medicine at Leeds University and fertility spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, shares Barnsley’s concerns. “We’re not very good in the west at preventative medicine, and in the world of infertility we are treating lots of things that could have been prevented,” he says. If IVF has the reputation for being a panacea then that, he stresses, is misplaced. “IVF doesn’t work for everyone, and it’s not available on the NHS for everyone.” As well as being expensive (some of the women I spoke to have spent upwards of £20,000 on their quest for a baby, and anecdotally others have spent far more), late pregnancy carries risks, says Balen. Miscarriage and pre-eclampsia, in particular, are more likely and the use of donated gametes increases those risks. Stresses around assisted conception can also affect a relationship.Both Carol and Hodgson have been mistaken for their child’s grandmother but all three women say they look a lot younger than their years and that few other mothers seem to clock that there is anything unusual about their family. Perhaps, Barnes muses, it takes a woman who feels younger than she is to e into late motherhood.For Gemma, being older didn’t mean biting her nails with worry through the pregnancy. “Because the egg was from a younger donor, the risks aren’t so great. I felt fantastic throughout. I concentrated on staying calm, on connecting with the baby growing inside me.” Most older mothers are advised, as she was, to have a caesarean. “It was a very easy birth: it took 10 minutes to get her out, and half an hour to stitch me up. And of course meeting her was so wonderful – I’d waited a long time for that moment.”For Carol, though, pregnancy was a scary time. “I had miscarried in the past and knew I had a higher chance of miscarrying because of my age. I felt I had so much to lose – it was never going to be a question of ‘you can give it another shot’ the way it would be for a younger woman,” she says. She developed pre-eclampsia towards the end of her first pregnancy and both her babies were born by caesarean. Unlike Barnes, she found that a “very peculiar” experience. Once her babies had arrived, though, she loved the early weeks and months with them. “I felt I appreciated them in a way that you perhaps only do with something that hasn’t been easy,” she says. She struggles to think of any way being older has disadvantaged her children.“I know plenty of people much younger than me who don’t seem to have much energy,” she says. “I think I do as much with my children as the other mothers I know – I only recently stopped bouncing on the trampoline with them. I don’t feel significantly different from when I was younger.” And then, she says, there are the advantages. “I stopped working by the time I had children, so I’ve been able to put all my time and energy into their lives.” Barnes works part-time, but feels she is able to devote more of her time to her daughter Hannah (not her real name) than she could have done when she was younger. “I’m in a much better place now than I was 20 years ago,” she says. “I’m very settled in myself, very content. I’m fitter than I’ve ever been, I’ve got enough money to be comfortably off and to provide for her. Hannah is everything to me and I don’t have to prove myself.”Understandably, the women who are making it work want to concentrate on the positives they bat off any suggestions that there might be disadvantages. “I don’t feel different from anyone else at mother and baby groups because, quite simply, no one has any idea I’m older,” says Barnes. “Having a baby is a great leveller. When you’re mixing with other parents it’s all about them, how they’re sleeping and feeding and so on. No one asks you how old you are.” Carol is more selfconscious about her age, perhaps because she is now in her 60s and has a child still at primary school. “Telling people how old I am is always a bit scary: you think, will people see me in a different light? I’m very careful about who I share it with. I don’t mind telling friends who have got to know me, but people I don’t know are more likely to judge me in a negative way.”She has also found her own needs squeezed between those of her children and her parents. “I had a very difficult stage where every time the phone rang I didn’t know whether it would be someone calling from school to say my son needed me or someone calling to say one of my frail parents had fallen down the stairs.” And if her own parents have had their experience of grandparenting curtailed, she knows that is likely to be repeated. “Will I ever be a grandmother? I do wonder about that.” Meanwhile, she says, some of her friends are already grandparents. “It does seem a bit strange, that we’re the same age but in such different situations,” she says.Barnsley has some concerns about the trend. “Fiftysomething motherhood will only ever be a choice for the well-off,” she says. “And some women will spend a lot of money on something that doesn’t, in the end, work out. Imagine borrowing £50,000 and then being unsuccessful.” She also wonders where the child’s perspective is in the debate. “I’m thinking of 21-year-olds who instead of travelling the world will be looking after a parent with Alzheimer’s,” she says. “They run the risk of being out of sync with their peers, and that might not be easy.” (This is also, of course, the case for men who have children in their 50s and over, although that is less rarely raised as an issue.)Barnes believes later-life motherhood will become much more common and she welcomes it. “The only two disadvantages, as I see it, are genetics – ie your child doesn’t share your genes – and the risk of dying while your children are still young.” Like Hodgson, she found the genetic issues faded into the background once her baby appeared, although she does sometimes worry about Hannah’s medical history, and what she might not know about it. In the future, she thinks young women will be encouraged to freeze their eggs for later use, as is currently being debated but at present in the UK human eggs can usually only be frozen for a decade, and fertility specialists say eggs from a woman’s 20s and early 30s would give her the best chance of a child in her 50s. So for egg freezing to be useful, the law would have to change – and some fertility clinics would like to see that happen. Other countries have different guidelines and legislation around fertility, and some British women travel to Spain, Cyprus and India in the hope of making it easier for themselves.One thing everyone seems to be in agreement on is that it would be better for young people in particular, and the whole population in general, to know more about fertility. Hodgson wishes she had learned more about it at school. In his role as chair of the British Fertility Society, Balen has called for the curriculum to be widened to teach young people about how to achieve pregnancy, as well as how to avoid it. And yet, one major reason women are tending to leave pregnancy until their 30s is for economic reasons: most twentysomethings can barely afford to pay the rent, let alone provide for a family. Workplace pressures on thirtysomethings to get promoted and zip up the career ladder is another factor weighing against younger motherhood and however well-informed teenagers become about fertility, there is no guarantee they will meet the person they want to raise a child with before the age of 35.Kamal Ahuja, scientific director of the London Women’s Clinic, which treats women up to the age of 50 but makes occasional exceptions for over-50s, says that while any doctor would advise childbearing in a woman’s 20s or early 30s, the emotional, financial and social realities, added to the fact that human beings are living “stronger, longer and with greater ambitions” mean the trend is almost certainly set to grow. He predicts that medical advances will make it easier and cheaper in the years ahead.Gemma Barnes, meanwhile, hasn’t written her to-do list for her 52nd birthday, which is coming up later this year. But when I ask her what’s going on it she smiles broadly and says she is definitely not ruling out a brother or sister for Hannah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccdafc1974374a892d3ce320b12bdc7c4cb8226f/0_316_2433_1458/master/2433.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da9845eb068f7d013782670eaa394088","title":"adrian chiles reveals anxiety presenting football itv","story":"Former chief football presenter says it reached point where he struggled to get his words out The broadcaster Adrian Chiles has revealed he had a problem with anxiety during his time as chief football presenter on ITV.He became the face of the channel’s football coverage in 2010 after six years presenting the BBC highlights show Match of the Day 2.Chiles’s airtime was reduced after he transferred to ITV, in part because of the advertising breaks on the commercial broadcaster.

The chances are that you exercise more and are less stressed than those who spend their hours in cubicles or holed up in their own offices.“In terms of impact on health, this increase in physical activity is important,” said Esther Sternberg, director of the University of Arizona Institute on Place and Wellbeing. “It is well within the range that would have an impact health.”The perils of a sedentary lifestyle have prompted the NHS to advise at least 150 minutes of exercise a week, and to reduce the amount of time people spend sitting. In previous studies, what has been termed “excessive sitting” has been linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, some forms of cancer, and an early death.Writing in the journal Occupational \u0026amp Environmental Medicine, Sternberg and her colleagues describe how they investigated the impact of office layouts on the activity and stress levels of 230 US government employees. Some worked in open plan offices with no partitions between desks, while others worked in cubicles with walls that could not be seen over while seated. Others still had their own offices.For three days and two nights, the researchers monitored the workers’ activity and heart rates via wearable sensors, and quizzed the employees about their mood with regular questions to their smartphones. Beyond the differences they spotted with office desk arrangements, the researchers found that stress levels were highest in older and heavier workers.Sternberg said she could only speculate why more active people tended to work at partition-less desks. One suggestion is that such offices typically have set places where people must go for one-on-one video calls small group chats or larger conferences, meaning that they move around the workplace more than those with their own cubicles or offices.One curse of the cubicle is that instead of finding a more private spot, people can talk loudly on the phone and in small groups, much to the annoyance of their neighbours.“If we can figure out how to design offices to allow people to be more active, that will result in better health and lower stress, so educating people about that is really important,” Sternberg said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb749882a41c28aa74a5cc0101d16bf694cb9045/22_10_5708_3425/master/5708.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1904b4a2be145caab2fe5281a3b4d3a8","title":"uk households face hidden debt of almost 19bn citizens advice","story":"Missed bill payments and benefit repayments overtake credit cards as key money worryBritish households owe almost £19bn in utility bills, missed council tax payments and overpaid benefits, according to figures revealing a hidden debt mountain facing the country.Putting an estimate on the overall amount owed by people falling behind on essential bills for the first time, the estimate from Citizens Advice comes as UK households are under increasing financial pressure. The charity said missed bill payments had overtaken credit card troubles as the key money problem faced by consumers.Using government records and making its own estimates from helping more than 690,000 people with household bill troubles last year, Citizens Advice said as much as £18.9bn was owed to the government and utility companies for bills such as water, gas and electricity, as well as unpaid taxes and fines.The analysis comes as concerns grow about the rapid growth of personal borrowing on credit cards, loans and overdrafts in the UK resulting in levels unseen since the financial crisis. While the Bank of England is responsible for tracking the rise in borrowing from high street banks, there are no official figures for missed bill payments.Calling on the government to face up to the scale of the problem, the charity said ministers should commit to measuring and reporting on the levels of household debt on an annual basis. It also called for tighter regulation of the bailiff industry to provide greater protections for people struggling with their bills.Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “There is an air of institutional indifference as far as household bill debts are concerned. The government must get a grip on the scale of this debt by accurately measuring and publishing the figure on an annual basis.”From the overall debt pile it uncovered, the vast majority related to bills owed to the state. Households owed more than £10bn last year in tax credits and benefits where the government had overpaid them and then demanded repayment, while councils were owed almost £3bn in council tax arrears.In one case, Citizens Advice said it had helped a retired couple who had fallen behind on some of their essential bills and owed £700 in council tax. It said they had become too afraid to open the front door after visits from bailiffs.MPs on the Treasury committee said in July the debt collection practices of public authorities have often been described as the “worst in class”, with debts pursued overzealously and with routine recourse to bailiffs. Since 2014, Citizens Advice said it had seen problems with bailiffs increase by a quarter.The charity found water companies were owed £2.2bn by consumers falling behind with their bills, while electricity and gas providers were owed almost £1.1bn.While there are formal arrangements open to people falling behind with credit card and other debts owed to banks, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority, there can be more severe consequences for people missing bill payments. Consumers can find themselves cut off by utility providers, evicted from their home because of rent arrears or jailed for missing council tax payments.Household bill problems can have serious knock-on effects for mental health or lead to additional borrowing. Citizens Advice said more than a third of people are likely to be out of full-time employment and that one in three people have problems with their mental health.A spokesman for the Treasury said the government was helping households by cutting taxes and increasing the minimum wage. The government has committed to introducing a breathing space scheme for people struggling with problem debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eeb694e6216fe1dc87ad71b154be3cc03642b73/0_138_3352_2010/master/3352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47abc6b4280db0e7e7d4a354a352a6ac","title":"mtv vmas camila cabello wins big while madonna pays tribute to aretha franklin","story":"A muted ceremony saw the Havana singer win video and artist of the year while the late soul singer was remembered in a brief memorialThis year’s MTV Video Music Awards saw Camila Cabello taking home the night’s two biggest trophies for artist and video of the year for Havana, beating out Drake and Childish Gambino.During her speech, the former Fifth Harmony singer gave a “shoutout to all the amazing female artists this year”.The night was kicked off by Cardi B appearing onstage with what looked like her recently born baby but instead, she was holding a blanketed VMA, announcing herself to be “the empress” before introducing a performance by Shawn Mendes. It was a more muted start for the VMAs following on from last year’s politically charged opener from Kendrick Lamar.Later in the evening Cardi B picked up awards for best collaboration with Jennifer Lopez and DJ Khaled, and best new artist. “A couple of months ago people were saying you were gambling your career by having a baby,” she said.This year there was no host but instead a selection of presenters, some taking control of the stage for longer than others, such as Kevin Hart who teased that “You never know what’s gonna happen at the VMAs.” It was a message echoed by MTV’s interstitials, suggesting that big surprises were in store – but they were few and far between.Given the short period of time since Aretha Franklin’s death last week, the ceremony didn’t include a much-expected musical homage but instead, Madonna came onstage to share a story about how singing You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman) at an audition changed her life. “She led me to where I am today and I know she influenced so many people in this room tonight,” she said. “I want to thank you Aretha for empowering all of us.”But the singer’s tribute to the late star proved unpopular with many. The Breakfast Club host Charlamagne Tha God tweeted: “I thought Madonna was supposed to be paying homage to Aretha but I all heard was her paying homage to herself,” while comedian Roy Wood Jr joked: “’If it wasn’t for Aretha, we wouldn’t have Madonna’ – Madonna.”Major winners included Nicki Minaj picking up best hip-hop video for Chun-Li and Post Malone beating out Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars (featuring Cardi B) and Drake to take home song of the year for his hit Rockstar. Ariana Grande won best pop video for No Tears Left to Cry, thanking her fiance, SNL star Pete Davidson “for existing”. Avicii, who died in April, won best dance video for his collaboration with Rita Ora, who paid tribute to him during the ceremony.Many of the industry’s biggest stars weren’t in attendance, with Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Childish Gambino, Drake and Ed Sheeran all steering clear. Instead, the ceremony devoted more time than usual highlighting up-and-coming artists with condensed performances from Jessie Reyez, Hayley Kiyoko, PrettyMuch and others.Arguably the most talked about video of the year, Childish Gambino’s This is America, was named best video with a message and was honored with prizes for choreography and direction. Beyoncé and Jay-Z were denied any of the bigger awards, and instead won for art direction and cinematography.Last year Logic performed 1-800-273-8255, named after the US suicide hotline, and tonight he returned with an equally impassioned setpiece, arriving onstage wearing a T-shirt saying Fuck the Wall, followed by children wearing T-shirts saying We Are All Human Beings. The stage, mocked up to resemble the border wall, proceeded to lift halfway through One Day, his duet with Ryan Tedder, to reunite the children with their parents.Other performers included Travis Scott and James Blake, Ariana Grande, Panic! at the Disco, Nicki Minaj and Video Vanguard honoree Jennifer Lopez, who delivered a medley of her biggest tracks in the night’s most extravagant sequence. The star became the first Latinx artist to win the award and in her speech, she spoke of the personal importance.“I grew up on MTV and this is really a tremendous honor for me,” she said. “It has been an incredible journey of dreaming my wildest dreams and then watching them come true ... I had to forge my own path and make my own rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd72a7592cecebbb64a577e3f3731ad949fa050/0_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a095ba84f19a1e77427865e6d1f944","title":"the inescapable weight of my 100000 student debt","story":" MH Miller left university with a journal full of musings on Virginia Woolf and a vast financial burden. He is one of 44 million US graduates struggling to repay a total of $1.4tn. Were they right to believe their education was ‘priceless’?On Halloween in 2008, about six weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed, my mother called me from Michigan to tell me that my father had lost his job in the sales department of Visteon, an auto parts supplier for Ford. Two months later, my mother lost her job working for the city of Troy, a suburb about half an hour from Detroit. From there our lives seemed to accelerate, the terrible events compounding fast enough to elude immediate understanding. By June, my parents, unable to find any work in the state where they spent their entire lives, moved to New York, where my sister and I were both in school. A month later, the mortgage on my childhood home went into default.After several months of unemployment, my mother got a job in New York City, fundraising for a children’s choir. In the summer of 2010, I completed my studies at New York University, where I received a BA and an MA in English literature, with more than $100,000 of debt, for which my father was a guarantor. My father was still unemployed and my mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She continued working, though her employer was clearly perturbed that she would have to take off every Friday for chemotherapy. To compensate for the lost time, on Mondays she rode early buses into the city from the Bronx, where, after months of harrowing uncertainty, my parents had settled. She wanted to be in the office first thing.In January 2011, Chase Bank took full possession of the house in Michigan. Our last ties were severed by an email my father received from the realtor, who had tried and failed to sell the property, telling him he could now cancel the utilities. In May, I got a freelance contract with a newspaper that within a year would hire me full-time – paying me, after taxes, roughly $900 every two weeks. In September 2011, my parents were approved for bankruptcy, and in October, due to a paperwork error, their car was repossessed in the middle of the night by creditors. Meanwhile, the payments for my debt – which had been borrowed from a variety of federal and private lenders, most prominently Citibank – totalled about $1,100 a month.Now 30, I have been incapacitated by debt for a decade. The delicate balancing act that my family and I perform in order to make a payment each month has become the organising principle of our lives. I am just one of44 million borrowers in the US who owe a total of more than $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This number is almost incomprehensibly high, and yet it continues to increase, with no sign of stopping. Legislation that might help families in financial hardship has failed in Congress. A bill introduced in May 2017, the Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy Act, which would undo changes made to the bankruptcy code in the early 2000s, stalled in committee. Despite all evidence that student loan debt is a national crisis, the majority of the US government – the only organisation with the power to resolve the problem – refuses to acknowledge its severity.My debt was the result, in equal measure, of a chain of rotten luck and a system that is an abject failure by design. My parents never lived extravagantly. In the first years of their marriage, my father drove a cab. When they had children and my father started a career in the auto industry, we became firmly middle-class, never wanting for anything, even taking vacations once a year, to places like Myrtle Beach or Miami. Still, there was usually just enough money to cover the bills – car leases, a mortgage, groceries. My sister and I both attended public school. The cost of things was discussed constantly. In my freshman year of high school, I lost my yearbook, which cost $40 my mother very nearly wept. College, which cost roughly $50,000 a year, was the only time that money did not seem to matter. “We’ll find a way to pay for it,” my parents said repeatedly, and if we couldn’t pay for it immediately, there was always a bank willing to give us a loan. This was true even after my parents had both lost their jobs amid the global financial meltdown. Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education, but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was not a waste of money it was the key to a better life for their children. They continued to put faith in this falsehood even after a previously unimaginable financial loss, and so we continued spending money that we didn’t have – money that banks kept giving to us.I have spent a great deal of time during the last decade shifting the blame for my debt. Whose fault was it? My devoted parents, for encouraging me to attend a school they couldn’t afford? The banks, which should have never lent money to people who clearly couldn’t pay it back to begin with, continuously exploiting the hope of families like mine, and quick to exploit us further once that hope disappeared? Or was it my fault for not having the foresight to realise it was a mistake to spend roughly $200,000 on a school where, in order to get my degree, I kept a journal about reading Virginia Woolf? (Sample passage, which assuredly blew my mind at the time: “We are interested in facts because we are interested in myth. We are interested in myth insofar as myth constructs facts.”) The problem, I think, runs deeper than blame. The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless – that its value was above or beyond its cost. College was not a right or a privilege, but an inevitability on the way to a meaningful adulthood. What an irony that the decisions I made about college when I was 17 have derailed such a goal.After the dust settled on the collapse of the economy, on my family’s lives, we found ourselves in an impossible situation: we owed more each month than we could collectively pay. And so we wrote letters to Citibank’s mysterious PO box address in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, begging for help, letters that I doubt ever met a human being. We grew to accept Citibank as a detestable Moloch that we feared and hated, but were made to worship. The letters began to comprise a diary for my father in particular, a way to communicate a private anguish that he mostly bottled up, as if he was storing it for later. In one letter, addressed “Dear Citi,” he pleaded for a longer-term plan with lower monthly payments. He described how my mother’s mounting medical bills, as well as Chase Bank’s collection on our foreclosed home, had forced the family into bankruptcy, which provided no protection in the case of private student loans. We were not asking, in the end, for relief or forgiveness, but merely to pay them an amount we could still barely afford. “This is an appeal to Citi asking you to work with us on this loan,” he wrote to no one at all.Finally, at the beginning of 2012, my father started writing to the office of Congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district in the Bronx where my parents had relocated. In one of these letters, he described watching Too Big to Fail, an HBO film about the financial crisis, which had come out several months earlier. (My parents lost every asset they had, but they still subscribed to HBO, which became more than TV for them – a symbolic relic of their former class status.)The recession was over, officially anyway, and people who had not suffered its agonies were already profiting from its memory. Recession films often took place in the gleaming offices of hedge funds and investment banks, with attractive celebrities offering sympathetic portrayals of economists and bankers – Zachary Quinto, in 2011’s Margin Call, for instance, plays a rocket scientist turned risk analyst with a heart of gold, a do-gooder who discovers that his employer has leveraged itself to the edge of bankruptcy. These films often depicted figures who experienced little to no repercussions for their roles in leading the country into a recession, who abused the misfortune of people like my parents – unmentionables who owed more on their houses than what they had paid for them and, of course, rarely featured in the story at all.My father described himself and my mother to Crowley as “the poster children for this entire financial event”, by which he meant Americans who seemed to have done everything right on paper, but in doing so contributed to their own downfall. By the time he wrote to Crowley, my father was working again, but it had taken him two years to find another job, which paid him much less money. After his run of financial calamity, he knew better than to believe anything good would last. “We are in our 60s and I figure when we get to our mid-70s life will become difficult again,” he wrote.Crowley’s office wrote back. It was the first time in about two years that a person had responded to our correspondence with encouragement, or something like it. Someone who worked for his office in Washingtonhelped to arrange a conference call with government liaisons from Citigroup to discuss a different payment plan. The monthly payments to Citi were then more than $800 a month, and we were trying to talk them into letting us pay the loan over a longer period, at a rate of about $400 a month. These terms were reasonable enough, but the response to this request was like an automated message brought to life: “We are precluded from a regulatory perspective from being able to do what you are asking,” each of the representatives said. What made these exchanges more ridiculous was the fact that Citibank was in the process of retreating from the student loan market by selling off my debt to Discover Financial, who would give us the same response. We were nothing to these companies but a number in a database. And they fully controlled our fates.I used to wonder if the people who worked for these lenders had families of their own, and if they would ever find themselves bankrupt, wondering where they were going to live. Most of all, I wondered what they would do if their own children had to take out loans to pay for college. After 10 years of living with the fallout of my own decisions about my education, I have come to think of my debt as like an alcoholic relative from whom I am estranged, but who shows up to ruin happy occasions. But when I first got out of school and the reality of how much money I owed finally struck me, the debt was more of a constant and explicit preoccupation, a matter of life and death.I had studied English because I wanted to be a writer. I never had an expectation of becoming rich. I didn’t care about money. My MA fed an intellectual curiosity that eventually led me to newspapers, and I don’t regret that my translation of The Dream of the Rood from Old English to contemporary vernacular was not a terribly marketable or even applicable skill. I understand now the extent to which I was among the most overeducated group of young adults in human history. Still, following completion of this degree, I enrolled for an evening class in French at New York’s Cooper Union, as that deferred my having to start paying off the debt, and the cost of the new class was cheaper than the monthly repayments I would have to make. Once I could no longer delay and the payments began, a question echoed through my head from the moment the day began, and often jolted me awake at night. I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans (my sustenance during the first lean year of this mess), and the price of a loan payment. The question was: What will you do when the money from the paycheck is gone?I never arrived at an answer to this question. At my lowest points, I began fantasising about dying, not because I was suicidal, but because death would have meant relief from having to come up with an answer. My life, I felt, had been assigned a monetary value – I knew what I was worth, and I couldn’t afford it, so all the better to cash out early. The debt was mind-controlling – how I would eat or pay my rent without defaulting was a constant refrain, and I had long since abandoned any hope of a future in which I might have a meaningful line of credit or a disposable income, or even simply ownsomething – but it was also mind-numbingly banal. I spent a great deal of time filling out paperwork over and over again, or waiting on hold for extended periods in order to speak to a robotic voice that would reject my request. It didn’t matter what the request was or who I was asking. It was always rejected.And so it felt good to think about dying, in the way that it felt good to take a long nap in order to not be conscious for a while. These thoughts culminated in November 2010, when I met with my father one afternoon at a diner in Brooklyn to retrieve more paperwork. My hope for some forgiving demise had resulted in my being viciously sick for about 10 days, with what turned out to be strep throat. I refused to go to the doctor in the hope that my condition might worsen into a more serious infection that, even if it didn’t kill me, might force someone to at last lavish me with pity. I coughed up a not insignificant portion of yellowish fluid before my father and I entered the restaurant. We sat at a table, and I frowned at the forms he handed me. I started the conversation by asking, “Theoretically, if I were to, say, kill myself, what would happen to the debt?”“I would have to pay it myself,” my father said, in the same tone he would use a few minutes later to order eggs. He paused and then offered me a melancholy smile, which I sensed had caused him great strain. “Listen, it’s just debt,” he said. “No one is dying from this.”My father had suffered in the previous two years. In a matter of months, he had lost everything he had worked most of his adult life to achieve – first his career, then his home, then his dignity. He had become a 60-year-old man who had quite reluctantly shaved his greying, 40-year-old mustache in order to look younger, shuffling between failed job interviews where he was often told he had “too much experience”. He was ultimately forced out of the life he’d known, dragging with him, like some 21-first-century Pa Joad, a U-Haul trailer crammed with family possessions, including, at the insistence of my mother, large plastic tubs of my childhood action figures.Throughout this misery, my father had reacted with what I suddenly realised was stoicism, but which I had long mistaken for indifference. This misunderstanding was due in part to my mother, whom my father mercifully hadn’t lost, and who had suffered perhaps most of all. Not that it was a competition, but if it were, I think she would have taken some small amount of satisfaction in winning it. The loss of home and finances felt at least like a worthy opponent for cancer, and yet here was my father telling me that none of this was the end of the world. I felt a flood of sympathy for him. I was ashamed of my selfishness. The lump in my throat began to feel less infectious than lachrymal. “OK,” I said to him, and that was that. When I got home I scheduled an appointment with a doctor.Navient released a public statement in reponse to that suit, which said: “There is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer.” When I received a notice from Navient in February 2017 that my monthly payments would be increasing, for reasons I did not comprehend, the email came with a note at the bottom saying: “We’re here to help: We’re happy to help you navigate your options, provide you with resources, and answer any questions you have as you repay your loans.” The company’s motto is, hilariously, “Solutions for your success”.These announcements flooded my inbox with subject lines declaring “Important Information”, but none of them altered my fate. Sometimes the monthly payments would go up, sometimes my salary would go up, sometimes I made a cheque out to a different company. The only stable thing was the money I owed, which never seemed to get any lower. And so the cash would go out to the various lenders with the blind hope that it was right. On top of all that was a dreadful anticipation that any day now I might hear from the credit bureau and my life would somehow bottom out.In some twisted way, I wanted it to happen. My mother’s cancer went into remission, and both of my parents found, in their 60s, new careers in New York. I maintained steady employment in journalism since finishing school, and in 2016 I was hired as an editor at the New York Times. Was it possible we had become lucky? I had spent so much time wondering what life’s nadir looked like that I was now curious whether it had already come and gone.In the summer of 2017, my father, now nearing 70, had lost another job, so I finally removed him as a guarantor and refinanced my loans with one of the few companies that provides such a service, SoFi. My wife, who agreed to marry me last autumn, would help with the payments when she could. Sharing the burden of my debt with my spouse instead of my parents was a small, depressing victory, a milestone perhaps unique to members of my generation, one that must have carried the same kind of significance that purchasing a home and having a mortgage had to my parents.SoFi has not made my situation much more tenable. The main difference is that I now write one cheque instead of several, and I have an end date for when the debt, including the calculated interest – about $182,000 – will be paid off: 2032, when I’ll be 44, a number that feels only slightly less theoretical to me than 30 did when I was 17. What I have to pay each month is still, for the most part, more than I am able to afford, and it has kept me in a state of perpetual childishness. I rely on the help of people I love, and I live by each paycheck. I still harbour anxiety about the bad things that could befall me should the paycheck disappear.But the “Important Information” I receive has changed. SoFi is a Silicon Valley startup that bills itself as “a new kind of finance company” its name is shorthand for Social Finance, Inc. In addition to loans, it offersmembership outreach in the form of financial literacy workshops and free dinners. Their aim is to “empower our members” – a mission that was called into question by the resignation, in September 2017, of its CEO, Mike Cagney, who employees allege had engaged in serial workplace sexual harassment and who ran the office, according to a New York Times headline, like “a frat house.” The allegations, according to a report in the Times, include Cagney exchanging explicit text messages with employees, bragging about the size of his genitalia, and the company’s chief financial officer offering bonuses to female employees if they lost weight. In January, SoFi hired Anthony Noto, formerly of Twitter, as Cagney’s replacement.SoFi has also received criticism for its elitism, and for courting only wealthy, high-earning borrowers – to which I can only say this is a category with which I do not personally identify, especially after writing the check to SoFi each month.The news ahout Cagney came out not long after I refinanced my loans with the company – I became, I suppose, a SoFi’er, in the company’s parlance. Around the same time, I started receiving curious emails from them: “You’re Invited: 2 NYC Singles Events” or “Come Celebrate Pride with us!”I will reiterate that I am a 30-year-old married man with more than $100,000 of debt, who makes less each year than what he owes. Buying a pair of trousers is a major financial decision for me. I do not think myself eligible in any sense of the word, nor do I find my debt to be amusing merely on a conversational level.Still, I felt as if in 10 years, the debt hadn’t changed, but the world had, or at least the world’s view of it. This thing, this 21st-century blight that had been the source of great ruin and sadness for my family, was now so normal – so basic – that it had been co-opted by the wellness industry of Silicon Valley. My debt was now approachable, a way to meet people. It was, in other words, an investment in my future, which is why I had gone into debt in the first place. Would SoFi be this friendly if I lost my job and missed a monthly payment?Let’s say I was morbidly intrigued. The day after Valentine’s Day, I went to a Mexican restaurant in the financial district for a SoFi community dinner – this was not a singles event, but simply a free meal. There had been another of these dinners nearmy apartment the week before, but it had, to my surprise, quickly sold out. The restaurant was packed with an after-work crowd in business attire, and SoFi had rented out the back room, where a few dozen people had gathered, all wearing name tags and discussing financial woes. Sid, a software developer from Queens who had racked up credit card debt after college, told me that the debt was a unifying force at these gatherings. “When there’s a break in the conversation, someone can just say, ‘So, debt, huh?’ and things will get going again,” he said. “If we walked outside of this room,” he continued, gesturing to the suits by the bar, “everyone out there would have debt, too. It’s just a little more out in the open for us.”Despite the name tags, the dinner turned out to resemble something more like an AA meeting, an earnest session of group therapy. Everyone had their story about the problems caused by their student loans and how they were trying, one day at a time, to improve things, and no story was exceptional, including my own. Ian, an employee for Google who had recently successfully paid off his debt from a Columbia MBA programme, became something like my sponsor for the evening. He said he had a few “bone dry” years, when he lived on instant noodles. I told him I had a long way to go. “At least you’re doing something about it,” he said, sincerely.We sat down to dinner. Across from me was Mira, a defence attorney from Brooklyn, who attended law school at Stanford. Her payments amount to $2,300 a month, more than double my own. When I asked her why she came to this event, she glanced at me as if the answer should have been obvious: her payments are $2,300 a month. The table, myself included, looked on her with an odd reverence. She wore a business suit and had her hair pulled back, but I saw her as something like the sage and weathered biker of the group, talking in her wisdom about accepting the things you cannot change.After the food was served, a waiter came by with a stack of to-go boxes, which sat on the edge of the table untouched for a while as everyone cautiously eyed them. The group was reluctant at first, but then Ian said, “The chicken was actually pretty good,” as he scooped it into one of the boxes. Mira shrugged, took a fork, and said: “This is a little tacky, but I’d hate to waste free food,” and the rest of the table followed her lead. Maybe the next generation would do better, but I felt like we were broke and broken. No number of degrees or professional successes would put us back together again. For now, though, we knew where our next meal was coming from.This article first appeared in the current issue of the Baffler• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ce5fcbb5a8537df77c59a5c10cce167ea311bc/22_129_3801_2281/master/3801.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd92173cf8ece3fc91a92a8539938846","title":"liam fox to offer uk firms help to export more after brexit","story":"Trade secretary hopes package of measures will transform UK into an ‘exporting superpower’The international trade secretary believes there are 400,000 UK businesses that could export but do not, and will try to target them with better loans, guarantees and support – and ask businesses to spell out what barriers to trade they face.The speech comes at a time when businesses are increasingly concerned by the lack of apparent progress in the UK’s exit negotiations with the European Union, as well as ministers’ decision to talk up a no-deal Brexit, which would leave firms scrambling to introduce contingency measures.The Federation of Small Businesses said the export strategy to be unveiled by Fox was “strong on aspiration”, but added that support from government was urgently needed after a summer in which ministers have said the UK may need to stockpile food and medicines.Mike Cherry, the FSB chairman, said: “The clock is ticking. If the government doesn’t act quickly and introduce financial incentives there is a risk the current uncertainty will have a serious and detrimental impact.”Shortly after Fox unveils the export strategy, Raab, the Brexit secretary, will return to Brussels to meet the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in the afternoon. Discussions on Tuesday will focus on the UK’s Chequers plan and the future relationship post Brexit. Talks will continue into Wednesday as both sides urgently seek to make progress.Before the meeting, the Department for Exiting the European Union released technical Powerpoint presentations given by UK officials in Brussels on financial services and competition policy.On competition policy, the paper said the UK would seek regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit. It said the UK was proposing “to make binding commitments to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on state aid” and would not lower environmental, social and employment standards.The financial services presentation indicated the reverse, that the UK needed an independent approach. It said the UK hosted “the world’s most significant financial centre” and as a result, rule-taking from the European Union “will simply not work for this sector”.UK Finance, the trade body for banking and insurers, said Raab and Barnier needed to make progress to ensure cross-border services remained uninterrupted. “Given the limited time available, it is vital that both UK and EU27 negotiators focus on ensuring a legally enforceable agreement that enables meaningful cross-border market access in financial services,” it said.The pound has been tumbling against major currencies since the spring and is trading at $1.28, its lowest level for a year because of worries about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The deterioration helps make UK exports cheaper, but the import of raw materials and parts more expensive.

In the north, the patches of ice appeared to be more isolated, according to Shuai Li at the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology in Honolulu.The images are the first “direct and definitive evidence” of water ice that is exposed on the surface of the moon, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “These ice deposits might be utilised as an in-situ resource in future exploration of the moon,” the authors write.The Indian Space Agency launched its Chandrayaan-1 mission to the moon in 2008 and was swiftly rewarded with evidence of frozen water on the lunar surface a year later. Rather than sheets of ice on the surface, the water is thought to exist as water molecules bound to grains of moon dust.Soon after the Indian feat, Nasa crashed a spacecraft into the 100km-wide Cabeus crater which is in permanent shade on the moon’s south pole. The intentional act of lunar violence threw up a plume of debris from which scientists were able to confirm the presence of water on the moon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f627f26c41618eb7ff34e1834bd09d27e8f6e468/0_407_5722_3433/master/5722.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82361efeab73eecf4c2b22d50aa4fdb4","title":"low mmr uptake blamed for surge in measles cases across europe","story":"More than 41,000 cases of measles reported in the EU in six months to June – almost double the number over the whole of 2017A huge surge in measles cases across Europe has been reported by the World Health Organisation, which says low MMR vaccination rates are to blame.More than 41,000 cases of measles have been reported in the European region between January and June. Last year there were nearly 24,000 for the whole 12 months, which was the highest count in any year of the last decade.“We are seeing a dramatic increase in infections and extended outbreaks,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe. “We call on all countries to immediately implement broad, context-appropriate measures to stop further spread of this disease.”In seven countries (France, Georgia, Greece, Italy, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine) more than 1,000 children and adults have been infected in the first half of 2018 and at least 37 people have died. The biggest toll was in the Ukraine, which had 23,000 cases – half the European total. There were measles-related deaths in all seven countries. Serbia, with 14, had the most.Two countries that had eliminated measles had outbreaks that continued for 12 months. The measles status of Germany and Russia has been reclassified by the WHO to endemic as a result. The outbreak in Germany began in Duisburg in early 2017 and spread to other cities.The WHO goal to eliminate measles from Europe by 2020 faces major problems because of regions or cities with particularly low vaccination rates and the easy transmission across borders of the measles virus, which is one of the most infectious agents known. Some of the deaths in Greece in 2016 were in the Roma community, who had not had access to immunisation clinics. Outbreaks in Romania, Italy or Austria quickly spread as people travel for migration, work or pleasure.Take-up of the MMR by parents for their children recovered across Europe, but there have been pockets of hesitancy and denial in every country, creating areas in which the general immunisation rate is too low to protect unvaccinated children.The cause of the vaccine doubters has been embraced by some political movements, who advocate “parent choice”. The Five Star movement in Italy opposes a law that would have fined parents who do not immunise their children, while in France, Marine le Pen of the newly-renamed National Rally party is against mandatory vaccination.The record number of cases “is a reflection of so many children and adolescents who are still susceptible to the disease because they are not vaccinated,” said Mark Muscat, medical officer for vaccine-preventable diseases at WHO Europe.“This is a disease that could be totally prevented by two doses of MMR vaccine, but we are seeing measles cases across all age groups.”In 2016, there was a record low number of cases – just 5,273 across the WHO’s Europe region. “But it doesn’t mean there were no susceptible iniduals. It was simmering in the background. When you get importation of the measles virus, it spreads like wildfire and will infect everybody who is still susceptible to the disease,” he said.Some parents do not take their child for vaccination while others delay. “I think there is hesitancy for very many reasons,” he said. “There are a lot of rumours and misinformation about safety. There are also problems where some parents have limited access to health systems and some have become complacent. They do not realise the importance of vaccinating their children because the diseases is not around.“That is totally wrong. Unfortunately we have some measles-related deaths. Last year it was 38. This year it is already 37 in the first six months.”In England there have been 828 confirmed measles cases so far this year, across the country. London had the biggest number, at 291, the south-east had 169, the south-west had 138, the West Midlands 85 and Yorkshire and Humberside had 80.“We have seen a number of measles outbreaks in England which are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe,” said Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England. “The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children.”Dr Pauline Paterson, co-director of The Vaccine Confidence Project team at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, called the high number of measles cases so far this year “astounding”.“While most people vaccinate, some iniduals do not. The reasons for non-vaccination can vary from issues of vaccine access, a lack of perceived need to vaccinate, and concerns around the safety of vaccination – in 2016 the Vaccine Confidence Project found that the European region was the most sceptical in the world on vaccine safety,” she said.“Vaccines work. If measles is to be eliminated, we must continue to further our understanding of the underlying reasons for non-vaccination and to address them with effective evidence-based interventions.”Ramsay urged people who might not have been immunised to see their doctor. “Anyone who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had two doses should contact their GP practice to catch-up. We would encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks, heading to large gatherings such as festivals, or before starting university,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4554c2f710d66ad4d9010fc1fb5cb340d7a385c1/0_288_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d1b5a94ea241c7b2036ab3def0f842c","title":"cracksman saved october swerving york international","story":"• Arc or Champion Stakes will be next, says trainer John Gosden• Gosden has strong hand with Roaring Lion and Without ParoleCracksman is unlikely to race before October, following the decision to take him out of Wednesday’s Juddmonte International at the final entry stage. While rain had been forecast for the York area, none has fallen since Friday, leaving the surface on the Knavesmire officially described as good to firm, good in places, rather drier than is now thought suitable for Cracksman.“He likes to get his toe in,” the horse’s trainer, John Gosden, said. “He ran well at Ascot but he wasn’t liking the ground much. I think we’ll now look towards October and either the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe or the Champion Stakes.”That means Cracksman is unlikely to grace next month’s Irish Champion Stakes, for which he is currently fourth in the betting. He is second favourite for the Arc, behind only his stablemate Enable, who is due to make her comeback from injury next month.Gosden still has a strong hand in the International, having declared both Roaring Lion and Without Parole, to be ridden respectively by Oisin Murphy and Frankie Dettori. “They’ll both be fine on the ground,” Gosden said.“Roaring Lion ran a big race when he won the Eclipse and has been pleasing us since. Obviously he meets the runner-up, Saxon Warrior, again.”While bookmakers have Roaring Lion as the 3-1 second-favourite behind Poet’s Word, they are less taken with the chance of Without Parole, available at 14-1 after finishing seventh in the Sussex Stakes three weeks ago. “I think that’s best forgotten,” Gosden said. “There was no pace and he wasn’t in love with that ground. He strikes us as a horse who could improve again for the step up to a mile and a quarter on faster, summer ground.”Friday’s Lonsdale Cup is also playing on Gosden’s mind, since his Straarius will land a £1m bonus from the sponsors, Weatherbys Hamilton, if the chestnut can add it to his three successes already this season. “He’s well,” the trainer reported.“Everyone thinks it’s a penalty kick because he’s odds-on but these things are never penalty kicks. It’s only just over three weeks since his last run, which is quick enough, and Willie Mullins has got three in there, so we’re being attacked from all sides.”Mark Johnston has seven entries for the first day of York’s Ebor festival on Wednesdaybut must be hoping he will not have to wait that long to break Richard Hannon’s record for most winners trained in Britain. The Middleham trainer matched Hannon’s career tally of 4,193 on Saturday but his seven runners since then have all been beaten, including three at Leicester yesterday.Johnston sends out three on Tuesday, the most likely of which appears to be Smile A Mile, a 2-1 shot for Hamilton’s opening contest.Tips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4920158eebfcfb36bc71195d92a0e629b63db3/295_421_2606_1563/master/2606.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e34a08f5a67b2062b7945551f07aa289","title":"jonny bairstow final two tests india wicketkeeper middle finger","story":"• Wicketkeeper fractures top of middle finger on left hand• Bairstow ‘hopeful’ he may still be able to bat in third TestInjury was added to insult for England on a demoralising third day of the third Test against India in Nottingham when Jonny Bairstow sustained a fractured finger that looks set to rule him out of the final two Tests of the series.Despite reaching the close on 23 without loss in their second innings, Joe Root’s team still face the prospect of having to bat out six more sessions at Trent Bridge to avoid a heavy defeat after they were kept in the field by India for all but nine overs of a day during which they set a world-record target of 521 to win.The sullen mood in the home dressing room was not helped by the injury to Bairstow, the wicketkeeper who sustained what England described as a “small fracture” on the middle finger of his left hand going for what appeared a regulation take in the 44th over of India’s second innings. The ball, bowled by Jimmy Anderson and left by the batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, caught the 28-year-old on the end of the finger and he immediately fell to the floor writhing in agony.After several minutes of treatment, an ashen-faced Bairstow was led from the field with his England cap covering his left hand. After being taken to hospital for X-rays, England confirmed the break – a hairline fracture – which is likely to take at least three to four weeks to heal.While publicly England confirmed Bairstow is “likely” to bat during his team’s second innings, privately team sources indicated the Yorkshireman has no chance of being fit for the fourth Test in Southampton next week and is almost certain to miss the final match of the series at the Oval starting on 7 September.Jos Buttler, recalled to England’s Test team at the start of the summer as a specialist No 7 batsman after losing his place as the Test wicketkeeper to Bairstow in late 2015, filled in behind the stumps for the remainder of India’s innings, which lasted 110 overs in total. He is now likely to assume that position for the final two matches.Whenever Bairstow comes to the crease during England’s second innings he will have to take painkillers – and possibly a cortisone injection – to get through the innings. Yet, according to Paul Farbrace, the England assistant coach, it at least appears unlikely that batting will risk any further damage to the finger.“There is a fracture in the tip of his finger, and the doc’s been working on him this evening to relieve a bit of pressure in the nail, so hopefully when needed he’ll be OK,” Farbrace said.“I’m no expert on broken fingers but because it’s not a displaced break, then he should be OK, and it’s just a case of managing the pain level as opposed to doing any further damage. There will be a big bit of plastic stuck over his glove. Let’s see how he goes over the next couple of days.

The alarm clock goes off and for a few seconds it’s all a blur before you slip into the familiarity of the weekday routine. This solo piece written and performed by Ramesh Meyyappan stretches that fleeting feeling of discombobulation across 45 minutes to ask what happens when you lose the sense of order we impose on our daily lives.Six alarm clocks wake Joe Kilter and their startling ring is felt throughout the show, echoed in the insistent strings of Joel Nah’s score. Kilter’s attire – smart shirt, suit trousers, tartan dressing gown – and a set that doubles as office and home reveal how his personal and professional lives have merged. The pernickety way he shines his shoes and adjusts his tie may raise a smile but increasingly become as edgy as the fevered drumming of his fingers. When an ominous brown envelope lands on his desk with a mock-sinister blast, he attempts to hide from its contents. Meyyappan looks as if he has aged 10 years as Kilter staggers away from reading it, discovering he has lost his job. The tragic way he hangs up his cherished suit jacket brings to mind the sacked doorman played by Emil Jannings in FW Murnau’s silent film The Last Laugh and his own security in his uniform. As the furniture begins to play tricks on Kilter, Meyyappan’s wordless show, directed by Andy Arnold, is wise and darkly witty about mental health. Nothing is played just for laughs: a sense of anxiety underlines each gag and sleight-of-hand trick. While it ends a little abruptly, this piece about our daily struggle for equilibrium is perfectly balanced as it confronts darkness with a light touch.

She said: “Very few parents give out healthy lunchboxes due to pressure from their children.”Her suggestions prompted an immediate debate, with  restaurant critic Grace Dent arguing that a ban would be unhelpful because it failed to take food poverty into account. “We’re currently in a position nationally where many kids are arriving at school starving,” she said. “Teachers are grateful if some of them have been sent with any food at all, even if it’s a tube of Pringles.”John Vincent, chief executive at the food chain Leon, said: “We would fundamentally agree with Prue’s view but ... advocate a less draconian approach.”The British Dietetic Association said that some children would prefer food prepared at home for a range of reasons. But it said the evidence suggested many packed lunches were not as healthy as they could be.Leith’s comments are not the first from a celebrity chef to trigger a debate over whether it is appropriate to criticise the food choices of some of the poorest in society. In 2013, Jamie Oliver claimed that struggling families could eat much better if they stopped spending their money on chips and television sets.In an interview with the Radio Times, he referenced a “mum and kids eating chips and cheese out of Styrofoam containers, and behind them is a massive TV. It just didn’t weigh up.”His comments were criticised at the time by chef Jack Monroe, who said his comments supported “damaging myths that poor people are only poor because they spend their money on the wrong things, rather than being constrained by time, equipment, knowledge or practicalities”.Campaigners and charities were more welcoming to Leith’s comments about a need for better education in school. Leith said: “The most important thing is to teach children to cook at schools. And not only to cook but to understand about where their food comes from.”She added: “I had this argument with Michael Gove when he was education secretary. I said, ‘if you made it part of the curriculum and part of the schools’ responsibility to address the lack of children’s knowledge on food and eating … you can justify that.’”A spokesperson for the British Dietician Association said: “Although food and nutrition are a part of the national curriculum, there’s always more we can do, and schools need more support to provide this education in an already packed school week.”Kath Dalmeny, chief executive of Sustain, which runs the Children’s Food Campaign, said: “In an ideal world, all schools would be providing good food every day and parents would be spared the hassle of making school lunchboxes. When we treat children’s food quality as a low priority, then junk-filled lunchboxes come into the firing line. But we should focus on the opportunity for high-quality school lunches to introduce children to a culture of healthy and convivial eating – habits that will last a lifetime. “In other countries, such as France and Brazil, schools are required to use fresh, healthy, sustainably grown and higher welfare ingredients, supporting children and local farmers and making best use of cheaper seasonal produce. This would be a win-win-win for children, farmers and the environment.”In the Radio Times interview, Leith also said the fuss about the show’s move from the BBC to Channel 4 now seemed totally unnecessary.The baking competition hit the headlines in 2016 after Love Productions, which makes the show, sold it to Channel 4. Leith joined the series after the move, replacing Mary Berry, who opted to remain with the BBC. She said: “It does seem, with hindsight, that all that fuss about the show moving from the BBC was so – I wouldn’t say manufactured – but it was so totally unnecessary to worry. If anybody had given it five minutes’ thought, they would have thought, ‘well why would a production company, who have got a fantastic success, mess with the formula? Why would they change it?’ ... So they didn’t change it.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c23b6d16c32b13a88eed00ca8e010e25c581642a/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c20557a8f5d0635ce6cc99909b9e04","title":"venezuela bolivars hyperinflation banknotes","story":"As South American country faces soaraway prices, what is hyperinflation and why is it bad for the economy? Venezuela is introducing economic reforms including new banknotes that lop five zeros off its fast-depreciating currency as the country battles hyperinflation.Hyperinflation is the term used to describe prices spiralling out of control, accompanied by plunging currency values – leading consumers to require wheelbarrows full of money to buy everyday essentials.In theory, prices should always fluctuate depending on supply and demand. Inflation is the term for rising prices, while deflation describes prices falling. Hyperinflation occurs when prices rise so wildly as to render the concept of inflation absurd.The problem comes when the supply of paper money in an economy outstrips demand for goods and services, causing the value of the currency to fall. This occurs when governments create new money to finance spending above their income from taxation.Hyperinflation in effect destroys purchasing power and encourages hoarding of goods, as people and businesses anticipate further price increases. Periods of hyperinflation tend therefore to be self perpetuating, as shortages further drive up prices.Lack of certainty over prices removes the incentive for buyers and sellers. The Times reports that restaurant owners in Venezuela no longer have menus with printed prices, while supermarkets have also removed prices from shelves. Many people use cards to buy goods rather than cash.Hyperinflation removes the certainty that a paycheck will be enough to meet living requirements, as prices rise to erode the value of wages. People can be forced to collect their wages in suitcases, although online bank accounts mean this is less of an issue than in the past.Aware of this problem, some Venezuelan companies have started offering unusual compensation packages, such as bonuses paid in eggs. Foreign currencies, retaining their stability, can also be used.Lower denomination currency becomes next to worthless. Over decades, inflation has the power to render some low denomination notes and coins irrelevant, such as 1p and 2p coins in the UK, where the government has considered scrapping them. Hyperinflation speeds this progress to unsustainable levels.There are often cash shortages and long queues at banks and cash machines as people require more money to make payments.Although considered rare by economists, there have been several occurrences of countries being gripped by hyperinflation in recent history.Russia experienced hyperinflation after the collapse of the Soviet Union, while Zimbabwe is among more recent examples, with soaraway inflation and the eventual abandonment of its domestic currency in 2009 in favour of the US dollar.Governments can use price controls to help manage periods of hyperinflation, yet goods at these prices can be scarce and black markets often emerge. Scrapping the old currency and replacing it with a new one or a foreign currency is one way out.Ultimately governments must restore stability through economic reforms and commitments to reduce the money supply. Boosting economic growth to balance the budget deficit, or using austerity and privatisations to raise money for the state to close the gap, are among the options available."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e3c6af5c7c009d1bda4b6b036f71ea72819645/16_173_2626_1576/master/2626.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4eea7edf65dc8803375a919a7014cb5","title":"yoga fitness and singing helped briton survive 10 hours in adriatic","story":"Cruise ship passenger Kay Longstaff was rescued after going overboard on SaturdayA British cruise ship passenger rescued after spending 10 hours in the Adriatic Sea has credited singing and her fitness through yoga with helping her to survive her ordeal. Kay Longstaff, 46, went overboard off the coast of Croatia as the Norwegian Star made its way to Venice. She remained at the naval hospital in Pula, Croatia, on Monday afternoon, although she spoke to a Croatian news channel after her rescue on Sunday and her condition is not believed to be serious.MailOnline quoted Irena Hrstić, a spokeswoman for the hospital, as saying Longstaff was being “assessed for stress” but is “physically fine”. Hristić described her as young, healthy and sporty, adding: “She is excitedly waiting for her boyfriend to come and take her home.”Longstaff, who lives in Benalmádena on Spain’s Costa del Sol, reportedly was previously employed as cabin crew for Virgin Atlantic but now works on private planes. The Croatian coastguard said the Cavtat coastguard rescue ship and an aircraft launched a search at about 6.30am local time on Sunday after Longstaff went overboard just before midnight on Saturday. The ship’s crew spotted her in the sea at about 9.40am and one of the crew ed into the sea to rescue her and take her to hospital.She was found about a mile from where she went in. David Radas, a Croatian ministry of maritime affairs spokesman, said that by checking CCTV, rescuers knew the exact moment Longstaff went overboard. “Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship,” he told the Sun. Last year, Cruise Lines International Association, said that out of more than 24.7 million cruise passengers in 2016, there were nine overboard incidents involving passengers, or about one incident per 2.7 million passengers. The Norwegian Star was delayed amid the search and rescue operation but arrived in Venice on Sunday. Lovro Orešković, captain of the Cavtat, said: “We have saved a human life, and nothing else compares to it. Throughout the dramatic rescue action we have demonstrated to be well-trained and skilled. I am proud of the entire crew, and particularly of Ensign Marin Delić, a rescue swimmer who took the woman, exhausted from the long hours spent in the sea, to the deck.”Longstaff told the Croatian news channel HRT that she fell off the back of the cruise ship and was “very lucky to be alive”.It is understood the Foreign Office has been in contact with both the cruise line and Croatian port authorities since the rescue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b81d73fe7b372a46cb617c4b298029300a5841a/529_379_3154_1892/master/3154.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f758d037539d6b3ef56727ca08da9a0","title":"jacinda ardern freezes new zealand mps pay tackle rich poor divide","story":"PM takes action against backdrop of some of the biggest strikes in a generation by public-sector workers Jacinda Ardern has frozen the salaries of New Zealand’s MPs, saying the pay rises were out of step with the wider workforce and were adding to the rich-poor ide.The radical move has cross-party support from Ardern’s coalition partners, as well as the opposition National party.MPs’ salaries and allowances would be frozen till July 2019, Ardern said, while “a fairer formula for future pay increases” is developed for those in politics, who earn between NZ$163,000 ($108,000) to more than NZ$450,000 ($300,000).Ardern said the freeze was “the right thing to do” and was not about cost-cutting, but making New Zealand a more equitable nation.Ardern earns more than NZ$450,000 a year, making her the fifth-highest paid leader in the OECD, and better paid than Canada’s Justin Trudeau and the UK’s Theresa May.“In the grand scheme of the government’s budget it is not a significant amount of money but this government has been elected off the back – and we have – of the principle that we are lifting the incomes of those in minimum wages ... it does not sit well with me or this government that at the same time we then have increases that are out of kilter with what the average New Zealander is seeing.”The Green party, the National party, New Zealand First and the ACT party all supported the prime minister’s surprise pay freeze.Green party Co-leader Marama Davidson said: “MPs are paid well above the average worker, so giving them a percentage rise accentuates their higher pay. When it is right for MPs to get a rise, they should get the same in dollar terms as what the average worker receives.“It is fantastic that there will be a review into MP pay increases in the long run, it is absolutely right that we interrogate how much MPs are paid to ensure they’re not receiving increases that are unfair compared to other New Zealanders who are experiencing slow wage growth.”The freeze was broadly welcomed outside parliament, though some political commentators said it was little more than “PR fluff”, and an easy way to appear altruistic.The freeze comes a week after nearly 29,000 primary school teachers walked off the job, demanding significant pay rises, smaller class sizes and more classroom support.Last month nurses held their first nationwide strike in 30 years, calling for better conditions and higher pay.

Meanwhile, Taiwan had received reports that El Salvador was considering establishing ties with Beijing in exchange for investment and aid.“The Taiwanese government is fully against competing in dollar diplomacy with China,” Wu said. Wu said Taiwanese officials had met with representatives of El Salvador’s government during president Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to Latin America last week. “Unfortunately, despite our tireless efforts we were still unable to save our diplomatic relationship with El Salvador,” he said.On Monday El Salvador’s president Salvador Sanchez announced in a televised address that his country had established diplomatic ties with China and ended its relationship with Taiwan.The latest diplomatic switch leaves Taiwan further isolated on the international stage as Beijing continues to put pressure on the self-governed island that operates under its own government, currency, and military. Beijing claims Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and will not maintain ties with any country that has formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.Relations between China and Taiwan have reached a low under Tsai, who belongs to the Democratic Progressive party, which advocates independence for the island. Since her election, Beijing has ramped up efforts to poach Taiwan’s allies. Now, just 17 countries recognise Taiwan, after Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic cut ties and recognised Beijing instead earlier this year.China has also pressured companies to take sides. This year China’s aviation authority demanded foreign airlines, including American Airlines, Air Canada, Lufthansa, British Airways, and Qantas to change any descriptions of Taiwan as a non-Chinese territory. Chinese and Taiwanese citizens have also entered the debate, calling for boycotts of the Taiwanese bakery 85 Degrees after it attempted to appease angry mainland customers when Tsai visited one of its branches. Last week Tsai traveled to Latin America where she sought to shore up support among Taiwan’s remaining allies, Belize and Paraguay.“Taiwan would not bow to pressure. Pressure would only make us more determined and united. It would only boost our determination to go abroad,” she said on her return to Taiwan on Monday.Additional reporting by William Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01d2336bb01fc547b5108038da84bf1c2b44de7a/0_473_4897_2940/master/4897.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bd49067c3d9bafcc55d06728286e97","title":"tuesday briefing alarm over 19bn in hidden household debt","story":"Citizens Advice says government not keeping track … irony noted as Melania Trump warns of social media pitfalls … and meet the new mothers in their 50sHello, it’s Warren Murray getting you into the news this morning.British households owe almost £19bn in utility bills, missed council tax payments, fines and overpaid benefits, according to the charity Citizens Advice.

Weinstein’s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, lambasted Argento for “a stunning level of hypocrisy”.The feminist writer Moira Donegan, in response to the Argento news, warned: “Cynical people are going to use inidual examples of women’s bad behavior to argue that sexual harassment and assault are not part of structural misogyny.” Rose McGowan wrote that she got to know Argento because of the “shared pain of being assaulted by Harvey Weinstein.

Photograph: Universal History ArchiveUIG via Getty ImagesThe old IRA disappeared almost four times as many people in Cork alone as the Provisional IRA did throughout the whole of the Troubles, new research claims.A total of 62 people in Cork disappeared in 1920-1922, according to research carried out by Dr Andy Bielenberg, a historian at University College Cork. The equivalent number in the Troubles was 16.Dr Bielenberg said the figure is based on his research carried out to document all disappearances in the county during the revolutionary period.He suggested the scale of disappearances involving the old IRA was “off the scale” compared with the Northern Irish Troubles and the practice was the “skeleton in the closet” of the period.He estimated the total number of people disappeared by the IRA nationwide between 1920 and 1922 to be greater than 100.He told the West Cork History Festival that the disappearance of so many people was the “darkest aspect of the IRA campaign” and that it challenged the idea that the old IRA was morally superior in its actions to the Provisional IRA.While a sustained campaign had been made on behalf of the disappeared of the Troubles to recover the bodies, no such campaign was ever started for those who disappeared in the revolutionary period leaving relatives without any place to mourn.Dr Bielenberg made his remarks during a talk about Mary Lindsay and her chauffeur James Clarke, arguably the most famous of those who disappeared in Cork during the War of Independence.Mrs Lindsay, a well-connected loyalist living near Coachford, and Clarke were executed in March 1921 as informers.She was accused by the IRA of revealing to crown forces that an ambush was imminent near Dripsey in Co Cork. Ten IRA men were arrested. Five were sentenced to death.The IRA took Lindsay and Clarke hostage and warned that they would be killed if the IRA men were executed. When the British authorities went ahead with the executions, Lindsay and Clarke were executed too and their bodies were never found.Dr Bielenberg said the Lindsay episode “exemplified the viciousness of the conflict in Cork at its peak and the unwillingness of either side to compromise”.Historian Cal Hyland told the festival that Protestants living in west Cork were almost five times more likely to be targeted during the revolutionary period than their equivalents living in Cork city.Mr Hyland reviewed more than 3,600 files in the UK National Archives relating to the Irish Grant Committee, which was set up by the British government after the War of Independence.It compensated those who had been loyal to the British state and those were perceived to have suffered financially during the War of Independence. By far the highest number of compensation claims (849) came from Cork city and county. Of those, 380 were made by non-Catholics, though they constituted just 10 per cent of the population of the country. A total of 468 compensation claims came from west Cork.Mr Hyland said the chances of being subjected to intimidation in west Cork if you were a Protestant was one in 33. By contrast, in Cork city it was one in 158, north Cork one in 68 and east Cork one in 75.An argument has raged for many years about the nature of attacks on Protestants, especially after the signing of the truce in July 1921. A total of 13 Protestants were killed in west Cork in April 1922.Historians are ided over whether those attacks were based solely on religion or whether or not the Protestants were targeted because they were perceived to have helped crown forces during the War of Independence.Mr Hyland said he had reached the conclusion that sectarianism was one of the motivations for the attacks.He suggested there was no other motivation for the targeting of 83-year-old John Northridge near Ballineen, who was beaten up by a dozen men in October 1922, nor the intimidation of 60-year-old Jeremy Kingston and his two unmarried sisters.Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3602339.1534791240!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"overloading of cars in donegal a worrying development","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSunday’s early morning crash in Bundoran left two dead and two others seriously injured. There were six adults in the car. Co Donegal’s road safety officer has said overloading cars is now one of their chief concerns when it comes to fatalities.Brian O’Donnell of Donegal County Council said the local authority recently carried out research into dangerous habits by car users. And one of the most worrying developments is large numbers of people cramming into cars late at night to get home.Mr O’Donnell was speaking following Sunday’s earning morning crash in Bundoran which has killed two people and left two others seriously injured. There were six adults in the car.Four people, none of whom were wearing seat belts, were thrown from the rear of the Peugeot 306 which struck a wall and a lamp post at West End in Bundoran at 3.25am on Sunday.Shiva Devine and Conall McAleer died instantly while two others are critically ill.A man arrested in connection with the crash was questioned at Ballyshannon Garda station on Sunday, but released without charge. A file on the investigation is to be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.Meanwhile, postmortems into the deaths of the two people killed in Sunday’s crash have been carried out at Sligo University Hospital.The funeral of Ms Devine (20) who was living in Belleek, Co Fermanagh, will take place on Tuesday at 11am in St Brigid’s Church in her native Ballintra, Co Donegal .Conall McAleer’s funeral is due to take place on Wednesday.A third person, named as Rachel Elliott, has been transferred from Sligo hospital to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin for additional treatment.“And when there is an accident we have an unfortunate outcome like this. Instead of picking up the phone to a friend or even to their parents to ask for a lift, they are piling into any type of car because they are desperate to get home,” he added.In the worst single crash in the history of the State, eight people were killed between Clonmany and Buncrana on the Inishowen Peninsula in 2010. Seven friends were killed in one car and a pensioner coming in the other direction also died.So far this year eight people have been killed on Donegal’s roads, compared to six for 2017. They include a motorcyclist, a cyclist, two pedestrians, a tractor driver and three passengers."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

I was doing the usual compering thing, asking people what they do for a living.“A guy said he worked in the Jobcentre and I said the joke that has now won the award.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/02/15/maniac.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6442916  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Maniac  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/02/15/maniac.jpg","title":"the office dawn lucy davis wonder woman twitter rejection audition turned down role edgar wright","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 star appeared in every episode of the beloved sitcomClick to followThe Independent CultureThe Office star Lucy Davis turned down an audition looking to cast actress ‘just like Dawn’ despite playing DawnLucy Davis has revealed she was turned down for a role despite being told by casting directors they wanted an actor “just like” the character she played in\u0026nbspThe Office.Davis played the role of Dawn Tinsley in Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant\u0027s BBC sitcom across its two six-episode series, which first aired in July 2001, and two Christmas specials.The actor, who appeared opposite Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman as her best friend\u0026nbspEtta Candy, shared the anecdote as part of the ShareYourRejection hashtag currently doing the rounds on Twitter.\u0026nbspPatty Jenkins debuts Wonder Woman 1984 footage at Comic-ConChris Pine\u0027s Steve Trevor is back in first look at Wonder Woman 2Ricky Gervais: \u0027I don’t court controversy – I try to deal with truth\u0027“Years ago I auditioned for a commercial in the UK,” she tweeted. “It was only when I got to the audition that I was told that they wanted an actress ‘just like Dawn from The Office‘.

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all

away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote

100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new

in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/20/18/Venezuela-money-food-7.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6479671  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/20/18/Venezuela-money-food-7.jpg","title":"venezuela hyperinflation economy nicolas maduro sovereign bolivar money socialism","story":"Created with Sketch.Critics say\u0026nbspmeasure\u0026nbspwill only make conditions worseClick to followThe Independent USVenezuela lops five zeros off its currency in bid to tackle hyperinflationVenezuela is launching a new currency that slashes five zeros off the country’s fast-depreciating bills, in a bid to tackle the country’s accelerating\u0026nbsphyperinflation.\u0026nbspPresident Nicolas Maduro\u0026nbsphas also announced a 3,000 per cent\u0026nbsphike in the minimum wage and a rise in the price of fuel to international levels, in changes that will be implemented\u0026nbspfrom Monday.\u0026nbspBut critics say the measures will only make conditions worse in Venezuela, which has already seen hyperinflation at more than 40,000 per cent\u0026nbspand a rapidly contracting economy.How Venezuela was brought to the brink of collapseFox News host ridiculed for comparing Denmark to VenezuelaOpposition leaders seized on tension among residents, calling for a nationwide strike and protests on Tuesday.

The clashes began after authorities closed subway stations, set up checkpoints and cordoned off a square where opponents had planned their latest protest against the government and the crippling economic crisis. Carlos Garcia Rawlins: For me that was the day that made a difference, never before had I seen the protesters and police clashing men-to-men and struggling back and forward.

Some 100 meters down the street, the protesters caught the man and surrounded him.

Brexiteer radio caller says EU deserve NO more chances to negotiate                May DISMISSES calls for Brexit deal vote Any package would need resolution for the reciprocal elements of the December 2017 deal.Making an offer is not only important to provide certainty publicly, but will enable the UK Government to take the moral high ground.A number of other plans are also dependent on the Government\u0027s position on this issue, relying heavily on the availability of existing labour in a \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario.The paper, which was said to have been given to ministers last month, describes the issue as one of the most important aspects of the Government\u0027s no-deal planning.A Downing Street spokeswoman declined to comment on leaked documents.She added: One of the priorities for us right from the get-go has been securing the rights of EU citizens living here.

Those who have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Many people are deeply sceptical about the tedious stumbling blocks that have bogged down the process.Almost half — 48 per cent — think the political classes are deliberately making heavy weather of Brexit in the hope it will convince the public to change their minds.Six in ten believe the EU is out to punish the UK by refusing to compromise in talks on trade and free movement, our Deltapoll survey says.But the vast majority are convinced a departure deal will be hammered out in the end, even if it takes longer than expected.Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel last night said: “The Sun on Sunday’s poll shows that the British people ultimately believe we can build a stronger future for our country outside the EU.Nearly half of adults believe the weather goes in cycles and that heatwaves come around from time to time.Barely a third of voters believe the human race is responsible and that we will have more extreme temperatures unless we act soon.Our poll found that a majority of 18 to 24-year-olds blame global warming for the hottest British summer since 1976.But in every other age group, most people think it has little or nothing to do with climate change.Six in ten over-55s believe it was “just another hot summer”.“It is clear that most people are sick to the back teeth of being ­bullied by the EU and listening to politicians at home erecting all kinds of obstacles to prevent them honouring the referendum result.“The Government should sit up and heed the results of this poll. That means being tougher in negotiations with Brussels and doing what the nation voted for — to get Britain out of the EU.”Most people — 55 per cent — are against a second in-out referendum, according to our poll.Forty per cent think we should just leave in 222 days’ time as planned with or without a deal.Fifteen per cent want a vote on the final deal, but not a re-run on whether or not Britain leaves the EU.Overall, only 13 per cent have changed their minds on Brexit since the referendum on June 23, 2016. Most of those were once Remainers. Fifteen per cent of them admit to having shifted their view — equivalent to 2.4 million people.That compares with just 11 per cent of Brexit backers, 1.9 million, who have had a rethink.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the poll had “nailed the lie” that many people regret voting Leave.Deltapoll director Martin Boon said the findings show most people are taking a tougher stance on Brexit.He added: “Half the public believe themselves to be under siege from the political classes trying to change their minds.“But the message they are sending back is that they haven’t changed their minds and the likelihood is they won’t.”Voters are evenly divided on whether there will be a hard border after Brexit. Twenty-two per cent say there will, 21 per cent say otherwise.There is also a split over whether leaving the EU will prove a historic mistake. Forty-four per cent think it will, 30 per cent believe it will not. One statement united 59 per cent of voters — “I’m really bored by Brexit.”Separately, our poll found that most people think former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was right to raise the difficult and sensitive issue of women wearing burkas. Two-thirds believe he was right to start a debate about the Muslim veil.But some say he should say sorry because he went “over the top” by comparing wearers to “bank robbers” or “letterboxes”. Half of Tory supporters and 36 per cent of all voters believe his remarks were right and he has nothing to apologise for.A further 28 per cent say he went a little too far with his language and should admit it.He gets no support from 23 per cent, who say his remarks were offensive and he should say sorry.Deltapoll interviewed an online sample of 1,904 adults aged 18+ from August 14 to 16. Results have been weighted to the profile of all GB adults.The Labour leader has defied the odds after damaging revelations about the friends he keeps.Half of voters believe Labour has a problem with anti-Semitism. More than a third say Mr Corbyn is part of that problem.But a Sun on Sunday Deltapoll has Labour three points ahead of the Tories.If there were an election tomorrow, Labour would be 31 seats short of a majority but with enough MPs to form a government with Scottish Nationalist support.Tory backing has been sapped as traditional supporters switch to Ukip in protest over the PM’s weak handling of Brexit.There is little to celebrate for any of the party leaders who all get negative popularity ratings.Mr Corbyn scores minus 35, while Theresa May is on minus 26 — only two points better than floundering Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable.Today, a Sun on Sunday poll shows that idea to be total codswallop.Voters simply want our politicians to get on with delivering Brexit.The majority of people have not changed their mind since the referendum.Our poll shows those that have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Project Fear has never worked, and it is not going to suddenly start working now. The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear.We didn’t and they’re not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This should be a nail in the coffin for the flawed idea of prison privatisation.It has known for a year the prison was dangerously understaffed.

The rest of the pool was closed to the public.“Josiah was distressed so I thought I would give him some milk.“I thought if we got out he would get cold, so I moved away and turned my back to the group.“I was only going to feed him for a couple of minutes to comfort him.“The teacher came over and said I couldn’t do it in the pool and I would have to sit on the side. I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong.“I didn’t want a confrontation so I moved, which I’m annoyed about now. I felt degraded.”Natalie asked for a copy of Dimensions’ breastfeeding policy, and found the rule under the Food and Beverage section.She said: “Stoke-on-Trent has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the country and they should be encouraging people, not doing this.”First-time mum Chloe, of Middleport, had a similar experience while at an Aquatots session with her 17-month-old son Milo.The 19-year-old said: “I have breastfed in the water before, but on this occasion a lifeguard shouted across the pool to me to stop doing it.The Equality Act 2010 states that it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.Councillor Anthony Munday of Stoke-on-Trent City Council said: We have many areas at our poolside where breastfeeding can take place and actively promote and support this, although we do ask that breastfeeding doesn’t happen in the pool.We take on board the feedback from mums and will do more to work with them to understand their views and consider if this is something that needs to change for the future.We are sorry if this has caused any distress to any of our pool users."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AD-PIC-Sink-Hole2.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"960","title":"sinkhole swansea south wales car craig y nos castle","story":"Castle assistant Karen Davies, 54, found her Fiat Panda had sunk bonnet first into the ground after finishing her shift at the attraction.Son Luke, 30, said Karen parked in her usual spot but was later told by colleagues about the sinkhole.He said: She was in shock and at first she thought it was a joke.The car was upside down.

I dont remember any takeaway dinners.I have met many people from many aspects of the Palestinian cause as a way of bringing about dialogue, as a way of bringing about peace.During a visit to Scotland, the veteran lefty was also probed about comments made by former Labour MP Jim Sheridan who said he had lost “respect and empathy” for Jews because of the antisemitism crisis.Mr Corbyn said: Its completely wrong what he said. He did withdraw it later on, he has been suspended from membership, there will be an independent investigation - independent of me that is - so I cant comment any further.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways. What a dispiriting, divided world that would be.I would far rather live in a world than has Jamie Oliver jerk chicken in it than in such a racially regimented PC nightmare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leader was speaking at an event alongside Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis at the Edinburgh International Book Festival (EIBF), where an audience member asked if there was a fear that Labour was not getting nearer to power. Mr Corbyn said: Labour has more members than we\u0027ve ever had before, more activists than we\u0027ve ever had before. “We have greater hostility from the mainstream media than we\u0027ve probably ever had before but I think we are in a strong position to keep people united around the agenda we put forward on social justice transformation, challenging and ending inequality in Britain and giving people hope of what can be achieved. Mr Corbyn and Mr Varoufakis had earlier discussed a range of political and economic issues in a sold-out event titled the resurgence of socialism.  Mr Corbyn said: I think we have to have the confidence that we can deal with poverty, with unemployment, we can do better in the future, we can have a sustainable life for all of us and we can work together with others around the world who think the same. Our unity of purpose, of people - all over the world - is something that I think is getting stronger. Don\u0027t be undermined by those who want to divide us, unite together around the kind of world we could create. We had a sniff of that in the last general election. I wish to God we had won the general election, I did everything I personally could to make sure we won that general election, but I tell you what - next time we\u0027re going to do it even better and even bigger and what\u0027s more we\u0027re going to win it.

Under current rules, MPs can claim \u0026pound150,900 a year for staffing their offices, rising to \u0026pound161,550 in London. The figure has risen from \u0026pound109,000 eight years ago. The calls surfaced in a survey carried out by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). Extra funding is available on a ‘case by case’ basis where members have specific need for more support. However, in its report on its annual feedback survey published this summer, Ipsa said some had said they still did not have enough money.  “There were also requests to further increase MPs’ staffing budgets due to their increasing workloads, some of which is the result of Brexit,” the report stated. Ipsa said that it had received 93 response to the survey - nine from MPs, 33 from MP proxies who manage their business costs, and 51 from other staff members working for MPs. The watchdog said it will “take into account any relevant consequences of the UK\u0027s decision to leave the European Union” when considering updating the rules on MPs’ expenses.

After years of watching their every step, mums and dads are left wondering what their offspring are eating, doing and who they are friends with after they start secondary school and begin to make their own way in the world. Four in 10 worry about the food and drink their child is tucking into when they aren’t with them, with 43 per cent often finding illicit sweet or fast food wrappers in their child’s bedroom or school bag. And 39 per cent don’t always know who their child is hanging around with or the company they are keeping – which makes losing control of their diet even more likely. Almost one in 10 even believe the point at which they have to start to let go begins as early as 10 years old.  But the study by Vitabiotics’ Wellteen found their fears may be justified as almost 40 per cent of parents believe their children eat more junk food such as cake, chocolate and crisps than they did at the same age. And more than half of parents argue with their teens about their diet, with the need to eat more fruit and vegetables top of the list. A spokesperson for Wellteen vitamins, said: “With a bigger range of snacks to choose from, it is no surprise many parents think their offspring are indulging in more junk food than they did at the same age.  “When our children are young, it’s easy to know exactly what they are doing, who they are with and what they are having to eat and drink. “Even when they start school and nursery, you still get a good idea of what they are doing from teachers and notes sent home. “But as they get older and start to do things on their own, it can be harder to keep such a close eye on them, especially when it comes to their diet.  “As they travel to school by themselves or head out unaccompanied with friends, they have the opportunity to eat and drink foods they know they wouldn’t usually be allowed at home. “As a result, parents are left trying to guess what they have had to eat and whether or not they are getting everything they need.” The study of 2,000 parents of teenagers aged 13-18 found six in 10 feel like they’ve lost control of their children as they’ve become more independent.  But this means 63 per cent of parents worry about their children getting all of the vitamins they need for a healthy diet.  The research, carried out via OnePoll found 12 per cent of parents admitted to having no idea how many chocolate bars their kids are eating while another one in 10 struggle to keep tabs on the number of packets of crisps they tuck into.  The same number couldn’t say how many glasses of fizzy drink are consumed while more than one in 20 have no idea if their children are eating the fruit and veg they should be. It also emerged that just over four in 10 parents think their child has tried an alcoholic drink – when in reality 44 per cent of teenagers claim to have already had their first taste of booze.

The dozens of messages left Charlotte Kendall so terrified she didn\u0027t want to leave her house for three weeks - and when she did, her mum escorted her. The 20-year-old first met Terry Waymark, 36, when she served him a \u0026pound2 portion of chips during an evening shift at work. But after taking a business card off the counter for her animal portrait company, he began to relentlessly text, call and email her. Waymark asked her on dates, called her late at night and constantly asked to meet up with her – threatening he would return to her workplace if they didn’t.  However, Charlotte eventually went to police when he texted her to say he knew she had been on holiday to Cornwall for four days. Just one day later, police pounced on menace Waymark and he was found guilty of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. He was jailed for four years and given an indefinite restraining order at Portsmouth Crown Court. Now with her stalker - also a convicted arsonist - behind bars, Charlotte, from Portsmouth, hopes her story will encourage other victims not to suffer in silence. The brave young woman, who is due to study veterinary nursing at university soon, said: It was constant. It didn’t seem to matter if I replied or not as the texts just kept on coming. “He was constantly asking if he could phone me but I made it clear we could discuss everything over the email and texts. “But then he asked whether I had kids and if I was single.  “I instantly sent a text back and asking why my current relationship status would affect the portrait. “Then he was asking if he could take me out sometime as ‘he knew a lot about me’. “Then he mentioned he would drop off an iPhone 6 at my work so we could talk. “I was freaked out. “Then he asked if I worked in the chip shop and if I had gone away to Cornwall and that’s when the penny dropped. “I realised Terry was the customer who mentioned he was a police officer. “I’m just glad we’re all safe and he’s locked up. If I hadn’t gone to the police when I did who knows how far he would have gone? “I still work in the chip shop as I’m putting money aside for university.  “But I’m more reserved with customers now. I just keep it to the basic ‘hello’ and ‘thank you’ as I don’t want to go through that again. “But hopefully what I’ve been through will encourage others to report potential stalkers. Charlotte first met Waymark while working an evening shift at her local chippie in Leigh Park, Hampshire in October last year. Impersonating a local police officer, he lingered around the takeaway asking questions for 30 minutes before politely being asked to leave. She said: “It around 8.30pm on a typical Thursday when Terry walked in asking for a \u0026pound2 portion of chips. “I noticed he was a new face as I’ve worked there four years and know who all regulars are. “He introduced himself as a local police officer which at the time I thought was an odd thing to do.  “I don’t know anyone who goes around shouting about their job willy-nilly. “He didn’t mention his name but kept going on and on about his job. “He was going on about the murder rate and how much of a dangerous area it is. “Then it was a bit more light-hearted and he asked if I lived in the area and how my day was going. “But he was looking at me square in the eye. It was just intense. “Usually customers only wait around if they’re waiting for their fish to be battered but he was just there with his chips going cold.  “My boss had to come over and tell him we were closing to make him leave.” In what was dismissed as an awkward customer encounter, Charlotte turned up to work as usual for the next two weeks. But while talking to a regular about her upcoming trip to Cornwall the shop door swung open only to mark the return of ‘PC Terry’. “I was joking about the amount of pasties and ice creams I’ll eat before a man with a bald head and stubble walked in”, she said. “My initial thought was ‘oh God not him again’.” “I didn’t want to get stuck in another half an hour conversation so I hid round the back and got my boss to serve him. “He seemed to be in and out pretty quick and didn’t bother hanging around. “I managed to dodge him.”  But Charlotte was unaware the creep had managed to swipe one of her business cards with all her contact details. Later that evening she received an email from a potential customer asking for a painting for one of his kids - sealing it off with eight kisses. She said: “I thought it was weird but needed to put money towards my dog’s vet bills. “At the time I just thought ‘a commission is a commission’. “I messaged asking what animal he was after and within seconds I got a reply asking if he could call me. “I had just finished a five hour shift and was exhausted so I just made the excuse that my phone couldn’t take calls. “But that wasn’t working. He just continued to ask if he could phone me.  “At this point I just thought Terry was a pushy customer.” Over the next seven days Charlotte was receiving between 20-50 text messages a day. Charlotte told her mum who encouraged her to phone the police. “As soon as I mentioned his name the police officer said ‘Ah, he’s known to us.’ “The police told me to send one reply telling him not to contact me again. “They then told me if I received a response to come back and they’ll take action.” Despite assurances from the police that she was in safe hands, Charlotte was still fearing her harasser was watching her every move.  Not willing to take any chances, she swapped shifts in a bid to avoid bumping into him. She was also chaperoned by her mum and her pet dog to and from her 20 minute walk to work. Two days after Charlotte received a message from a new number asking her out. Realising who it was, she went straight to the police where they arrested Waynark immediately. He was locked up at Portsmouth Crown Court having been found guilty of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. The defendant had previously been handed a 24 week sentence for harassing an ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him for impersonating a police officer.

In one of the notes Sophie George has left daughter Marcie Godfrey, she tells her: I will be watching over you and keeping you safe. Terminally ill Sophie was told in February she only had 18 months to live after being diagnosed with a Stage Four brain tumour. The devastated 27-year-old said the hardest thing is knowing she won\u0027t be around for her daughter Marcie. And as well as getting married to her little girl\u0027s dad in a few weeks, she wants to make as many memories with her as possible. The mum-of-one is writing letters for the day Marcie starts school, her first heartbreak, when she gets married and every birthday.  She hopes that the letters will bring comfort to her daughter during key moments in her life. In a letter to be opened on Marcie\u0027s first day of school, Sophie writes: “My darling Marcie. “Today is your first day of big school and even though mummy isn’t there to hold your hand or kiss you goodbye as you go in to your class, I will be watching over you and keeping you safe. “There is a tissue in your school bag that daddy has sprayed with Mummy’s smell so if you get scared just give it a smell to remind you of mummy and that everything will be okay. “Some children might not be very nice to you and you might get sad by that but don’t worry mummy will always love you very much. “Whenever you feel sad give your ‘mummy’ teddies hand a squeeze to hear my voice.” Sophie, of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, has written the letters to make memories and for Marcie to remember the times she had with her mum.  She said: It scares me every day that I won\u0027t be with her. I\u0027ve started writing her little letters for her to open as she\u0027s growing up. I\u0027ve written one for when she has her first day at school, for when she has her first period and first heartbreak and for when she gets married and has her first baby. “I\u0027m writing cards for every birthday. I\u0027m telling her that I’ll always be watching over her and keeping her safe. They will be for those times when she needs her mum and so that she\u0027s got something of me to keep my memory alive. They\u0027re for those moments when she would maybe be talking to her mum. Marcie is my life. She’s an energetic ball of fun who makes people laugh with her funny cheeky character.”  The full-time mum and Marcie’s dad Jay Godfrey, 28, have been together for four and a half years after meeting on Facebook .   The couple are also planning their dream wedding as Sophie decided to propose to builder Jay the day after her devastating diagnosis. Sophie said: I want to make the best of the time I\u0027ve got left with Marcie and Jay so we\u0027re getting married in September. We\u0027d spoken about marriage before but we weren\u0027t engaged. I thought \u0027we\u0027ve got to do it\u0027. It seemed right. I want us to be husband and wife. The day after I got my diagnosis I said we\u0027ll get married this year. The couple are to marry at The Warren Estate in Maldon, Essex, who have offered the venue for free while a local estate agent has paid for her wedding dress. Sophie said: It\u0027s taken a lot of the stress away. Everyone is coming together and the support we\u0027ve had from people has been amazing. We\u0027re really looking forward to it. We\u0027ve got a videographer to make sure that the whole day is captured and Marcie will be able to look back on it.  It will mean everything to me to be married.  Sophie said she first started to get headaches in January and by February they were getting really bad – even waking her up in the night.  She said: It was for 24 hours a day for about three weeks. It was like a shooting pain all over my head. I was taking strong painkillers but they wouldn\u0027t touch it. Jay\u0027s mum took me to opticians but I was being sick and couldn\u0027t speak. I went to A\u0026ampE to see if I could have a scan and they told me it didn\u0027t warrant one so sent me away with some painkillers. That was on a Thursday and by the Sunday I couldn\u0027t see or speak so we went back to the hospital. I had an MRI scan which revealed I had a 4.5cm tumour on the left frontal lobe. At that point I was just relieved to have a diagnosis. I was relieved to find out what it was and that they\u0027d given me medication to stop the headaches.  You don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be cancer. I remember thinking it would be fine. I thought they\u0027d remove it and it would be okay. I never thought for one minute it would be what it was. Sophie underwent a six-hour operation to remove 90 per cent of the tumour and was told they would target the rest with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She said: When I woke up from the operation it was a shock. There was quite a big scar on my head and it was a shock to see myself like that. The surgeon mentioned it could be a glioblastoma brain tumour but they would have to do a biopsy. It took 10 days for the results to come through. That was horrible. I cried every day. They rang me after the tenth day which was on a Monday and told me to come in on the Thursday to pick up my results. I thought it would be okay because if it would have been bad news they would have called me in earlier. So travelling up to the hospital we were all feeling very positive.  When I got there they went through everything. She said a lot of people have a stage one or two tumour but mine was a stage four and it was incurable. They said they couldn\u0027t say how long I have left but the average is 18 months. Obviously it was heartbreaking. I wouldn\u0027t see my little baby grow up. She\u0027d just turned one and a half and I was thinking I\u0027ll never see her go to school. I was with my mum, dad, partner and his parents. They broke down. We were all devastated. Sophie is now having chemotherapy having just finished six weeks of radiotherapy to try and prolong her life. The courageous mum said: Physically I\u0027ve lost some of my hair due to radiotherapy. That\u0027s one of the worst physical aspects. Marcie is too young to understand what\u0027s happening. I have a hair piece so she doesn\u0027t notice that I look any different. At the moment I feel fine. I\u0027ve not had any headaches.  They\u0027ve told me towards the end I may start to lose my memory and that scares me that my daughter will see me like that and that maybe I won\u0027t remember who she is. I\u0027m trying to be as positive as I can and taking each day as it comes. I\u0027m trying to prolong my life for as long as I can. We are looking at other options in Germany but it\u0027s very expensive so I\u0027m not sure how realistic that is. The couple are now planning plenty of trips together to make memories with Marcie while they can. They\u0027ve already taken her to Peppa Pig World and Disneyland Paris and are also hoping to visit Disneyland in Florida.

On Wednesday, a public funeral will take place to mark the youngster\u0027s short life. And movingly, instead of having a \u0027wake\u0027 after the formal service, his grieving relatives have asked mourners to take part in a \u0027day of fun\u0027 in his memory. They want it to be as fun as it possibly can.  The event will be held at Hull\u0027s St Mary\u0027s Queen of Martyrs Academy in celebration of Stanley, who leaves behind twin sister Elsie May. Organiser Kayleigh Pepper said: Stanley\u0027s family have made the decision not to have a wake as we know it but to celebrate his life in doing something that represents everything he stood for. The fun day will begin at 12.30pm, straight after Stanley\u0027s service and Jenny and Andy (Stanley\u0027s mum and dad) have one request and that is for it to be as fun as it possibly can. This is what Stanley would have wanted, especially in seeing all of his family and friends smiling together. All are welcome to the service for Stanley, which will be followed by the \u0027fun day\u0027 the same afternoon for everyone who wants to celebrate his life. Stanley\u0027s death has touched people across Hull and throughout the UK. A sponsored walk over the Humber Bridge last week saw hundreds turn out dressed in orange \u0027Stan\u0027 t-shirts, in recognition of his support for Hull City FC.  More than \u0026pound2,000 was raised on the day, which will be added to the \u0026pound3,000 donated by well wishers through a Just Giving page set up to support his family and cover funeral costs. Classmates of Stanley at St Mary Queen of Martyrs Primary School have also paid their tributes. A group lit candles and released balloons in his memory, with Elsie May laying out his school shirt and tie for friends to sign. Stanley\u0027s beloved Tigers also provided a fitting tribute for the little boy when they scored during 60 seconds applause on the sixth minute of their match against Aston Villa on August 6. In a tribute to Stanley, Sarah Carr, the mother of his best friend and one of the organisers of the fundraising appeal, said: To describe Stanley, he was beautiful, had the most amazing eyes and the longest eye lashes that only a girl could dream about. He was lots of fun and happy all the time. Stanley had the ability to melt your heart as soon as you saw him.

Robert Snape, a vice president of Citibank, was left in agony by his condition but did not take any painkillers as he wanted to keep a clear head for his high-pressured job. Mr Snape, 36, had suffered chronic back problems since the age of 16 but not take any medication in case it clouded his judgement at work, the hearing was told. He had researched physiotherapy options on his phone before taking his life - and the pain had become so bad that it had started affecting his mobility. Mr Snape was tragically found by a work colleague at the Marriott Hotel Colonia Santa Fe in the financial district of Mexico City, where they had been staying on March 8.  The fraud risk manager, from Mickleover, Derby, had been living in Budapest, Hungary, since 2012 while working for one of the world\u0027s biggest financial institutions. An inquest heard his back pain would have been made worse by the cramped conditions of the 14-and-a-half-hour long haul flight from Budapest to Mexico City.  Mr Snape had no history of depression or mental illness, Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner\u0027s Court was told. He was not under the influence of alcohol or either prescription or illegal drugs at the time of his death.  Derbyshire’s Senior Coroner, Dr Robert Hunter read evidence from forensic pathologist Dr Andrew Hitchcock, who carried out a post-mortem examination at Royal Derby Hospital, as well as a report written by Mexican police. Dr Hunter said: “Robert Snape was born on December 2, 1981 in Rutherglen, Scotland. He was single and was vice-president of a bank. “According to the post-mortem by Dr Andrew Hitchcock, there was congestion to the lungs. The lung air space was filled with fluid - which can be an indication of asphyxia. “In the Mexican authorities\u0027 police report, the cause of death is stated as asphyxia by hanging. There was a lack of oxygen to the brain.  “The blood samples were all negative for any alcohol at the time of death, and there was no evidence of prescribed medication or misuse of drugs. The toxicology was negative. “There was no evidence of any disturbance in the room. According to analysis of the door key, the only person entering that room was Robert himself and cleaning staff. “CCTV footage shows no one apart from Robert and the cleaning staff entering. No other parties were seen entering or leaving Robert’s room. “Robert had never suffered from depression or mental illness, but he did suffer from chronic back pain since the age of 16. Latterly it was affecting his gait, walking and sitting. “He did not take any medication for his pain because it might cloud his thinking and judgement. Dr Hunter told the inquest that Mr Snape\u0027s mobile phone was analysed and he had been researching websites in relation to back pain. He added that Mr Snape did not access any self harm or suicide websites. “I am satisfied there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Robert’s death, Dr Hunter said, continuing to read the evidence. Robert died as a result of his own actions with no third party involvement.

The East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) workers were dealing with a genuine emergency when they returned to find the hand-written letter. The service released a photo of the note and begged homeowners to show patience if an ambulance blocks their driveway while paramedics are busy saving lives. The note, left on the windscreen in Leicester, said: “You blocked my drive way. I waited 45 mins for you to move. “Please have some consideration where you park the ambulance! This is not the first time.”  An EMAS spokeswoman said she was unable to give any more details on where and when the note was left due to \u0027patient confidentiality\u0027. In response to the incident, EMAS manager Lee Brentnall, said such notes were upsetting his crews. “It is so disappointing to see that a rude note has yet again been left on one of our ambulances, he said. “This upsets our dedicated ambulance crews when they are trying to help our patients and do their job. “Leaving a note will not resolve the situation as we are unlikely to see it until we are leaving in the ambulance to take the patient to hospital or to go to our next job. “Our crews are approachable. If you genuinely need to leave your house urgently and we are blocking your access, please come and knock on the door where the emergency is taking place.” Mr Brentall, who is the paramedic and ambulance operations manager for Leicestershire, added there could be some occasions when moving the ambulance immediately would not be possible but said that would not always be the case.

James Tobin, then 21, had slapped his girlfriend Kellie Gillard, 25, in a \u0027post-sex arugment\u0027 and she fell out of bed and fatally hit her head.  Tobin initially told police she had died from a drug overdose, and then changed his story to say she had fallen and hit her head, reports WalesOnline.  Suspicious detectives put a secret recording device in his home and they heard him confess to his father to the killing.  At Tobin\u0027s trial in January last year prosecutor Vincent Coughlin said the couple had a row after having sex on April 24 2015 - Kellie kicked Tobin, who responded by slapping her.  He concedes that in a short exchange of violence, after he had been kicked in the head, he must have delivered a number of forceful blows with an open hand.  Miss Gillard was put on a life-support machine before her organs could be donated - the court heard this helped save the lives of six others, reports the BBC .   Now in a new ITV show, South Wales Police have shown for the first time how they ended up catching the killer.  After a pathologist found bruising on Kellie\u0027s body, a further examination was carried out. It showed bruising behind her ears which police said was consisted with an assault. As far as the evidence was showing, the account was showing the James Tobin account wasn\u0027t accurate, Detective Chief inspector Gareth Morgan told Crime Files showing on ITV Wales tonight. A week after Kellie\u0027s death, Tobin was arrested again on suspicion of murder. But he told police it was all an accident and that Kellie had fallen from the bed.  In a police interview, Tobin said: She got giddy or light-headed and just fell over and banged her head. Tobin added she may have banged her head on a radiator or drawers, with bruising caused by them having sex. There was just one problem. When police went to investigate his room where it happened, he had taken his furniture with him.  In the days subsequent to Kellie\u0027s death, he had vacated this room and gone to live elsewhere, Detective Constable Richie Rees said. He had taken his furniture with him. It was important for us to locate that furniture and place it back at the scene to compare it to the original photographs, so we were able to put it back in situ as it was and take the necessary measurements. James Tobin\u0027s account was that during the evening of Kellie\u0027s death, she had stood on the bed and then fallen and then he suggests hit her head on something.  So it was important for us to test that evidence to see if that was in fact feasible. It was highly unlikely Kellie\u0027s injuries had been caused by a fall. There wasn\u0027t enough evidence to charge Tobin, and he was released on bail. Police needed more evidence to prove he had killed Kellie.  But after detectives discovered that Tobin had a past of controlling behaviour and domestic violence with both Kellie and previous partners, they decided to install a secret listening device into Tobin\u0027s home. On there was one conversation that sounded like a confession by Tobin. I said she\u0027s chopsing so I just put her to sleep like, Tobin told his father. \u0027Chopsing\u0027 is a Welsh slang term for arguing or saying disrespectful things to someone. His father replied: That\u0027s between you and me butt. No one else will ever know that. You \u0027sparked her\u0027 was your words. She was going to die right, she was an accident waiting to happen. It\u0027s unfortunate, it\u0027s you it happened with.  But she always thought she was clever. That\u0027s a local term, Detective Rees told presenter of the ITV show. Andrea Byrne, as they watched the footage. To spark somebody effectively means to punch them and knock them out. James Tobin, as I\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware, was a trained boxer. But police also found another confession. When Tobin was first arrested, he called his dad from his cell. That call was recorded by police.  I decked her, Tobin said. Oh G, I actually killed her. I killed her, I gave her the best punch. This was the golden nugget, the moment where the investigation team had a collective sigh and looked at each other around the room, thinking ‘this is it’, Detective Chief Inspector Morgan said. I think James Tobin thought he got away with it. And that\u0027s what\u0027s unique about this case. He probably would have got away with it if we hadn\u0027t gone to such lengths and used all the tools available to us. If we hadn\u0027t had such a committed investigation team, I think the likelihood is he would have walked away. Tobin pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Swansea Crown Court and was jailed for 12-and-a-half years in prison, with a four-year extended licence. Charges against Mark Tobin for perverting the course of justice were dropped.

Laura Lambert woke up with a purple rash on her face as she was struck down with deadly sepsis. The graphic designer deteriorated to the point where she had to be kept alive with the help of a ventilator. It was touch and go as Laura\u0027s loved ones were prepared for the worst amid fears she may not survive, the Daily Record reports.  On the day she had fallen ill, Laura had felt sick, cold and jittery while out watching an ice hockey game. She put it down to the freezing rink temperatures and sound of loud horns. But Laura spent eight weeks fighting for her life in intensive care after her body was ravaged by the killer infection which claims 44,000 UK lives a year. Sepsis - also known as blood poisoning - is the immune system\u0027s overreaction to an infection or injury. Laura has been told by doctors the disease she contracted was airborne - which can be caused by the streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. But she battled back from the brink and her infection markers were reduced by almost half following the amputation of her left leg below the knee in March last year. She also had her right leg reconstructed and fingers shortened after contracting the illness in February last year.  Laura, who is married to mechanical engineer Charlie, 27, had to learn how to eat, talk, walk and use her hands again and she was later fitted with a prosthetic leg. However, doctors are amazed by Laura\u0027s miracle recovery which saw her return to work just nine months after having her leg amputated. The keen climber recently walked up the Little Orme in Llandudno which is 141m high - in what she says is a huge step forward in her bid to lead a normal life. Laura, from Widnes, Cheshire, said: After being incubated for so long I struggled to talk and had to communicate by nodding my head. When I first lost my leg I asked: \u0027Will I ever walk again?\u0027 to which I was told: \u0027We don\u0027t know\u0027. From that point, I was determined to push myself and build up my strength to get back on my feet. I was lucky enough to survive but many are not as lucky. We don\u0027t actually know the source of it, quite often when you get sepsis it\u0027s through a cut or an open wound whereas with me it was airborne.  Season ticket holder Laura suddenly fell ill on February 5 last year while out with family watching Widnes Wild Ice hockey team. She complained of a headache and attempted to sleep it off, but woke up in the morning with a purple rash on her face. Paramedics immediately gave her antibiotics before she was rushed to hospital in a critical condition where medics diagnosed her with pneumococcal septicaemia. I was feeling a bit sickly, cold and jittery and had a headache, she added. It was cold in the ice hockey rink so it wasn\u0027t really unexpected and it\u0027s really loud with air horns so you are bound to get a headache. It wasn\u0027t until we got home that I was quite sick with flu-like symptoms so we decided to get an early night not thinking anything of it. Laura\u0027s symptoms persisted until Charlie insisted on calling medics. She recalled: I was hot and lethargic and it wasn\u0027t until Charlie came down in the morning, he thought we needed to call an ambulance because my face had developed a purple rash.

The 35-year-old is trying to raise \u0026pound50,000 to undergo a treatment which could save her life. Jade Baldwin, from Pitsea, has a rare form of blood cancer called Hodgkin\u0027s Lymphoma and underwent four different chemotherapy treatments over the last two years, but none of them have been successful enough to beat it. She is also battling the illness with her father, who has terminal cancer, and sometimes they even receive treatment in the same hospital together. Jade is now relying on the generosity of others so that she can receive a new and potentially lifesaving drug, reports Essex Live.  Jade, who is a project manager, had been suffering from mystery symptoms for two years before she finally received a diagnosis. She said: I think the main symptom for me was an itch, but there was nothing to scratch. I have got scars from where I scratched so much. I also got sores and I was very tired, I was literally falling asleep at work. It was really hard to diagnose, because most people get enlarged lymph nodes, which is why they go to the doctor. Unfortunately I didn\u0027t have any of that. They think I had the cancer for a few years before I was diagnosed. Jade was eventually diagnosed with Hodgkin\u0027s Lymphoma following a hospital visit in November 2016 after she experienced problems with her breathing.  They gave her antibiotics to deal with the infection and asked her to come back in January for some more tests. In February 2017, doctors discovered her lymph nodes were swollen when she visited the hospital with her partner Vince. Once they said the lymph nodes were swollen I Googled it, so when I went back I was expecting it to either be just an infection or Hodgkin\u0027s Lymphoma, Jade explained. They put me and my partner in a room and said the doctor would be coming. You know it\u0027s probably bad when the doctor is giving the news. My first response when they told me was that I\u0027m not surprised. I had been feeling ill for so long it was a relief to know what was wrong and I thought something could be done about it. My partner was in shock at the time, but he has really taken it in his stride. He\u0027s taken care of me and has kept me upbeat. Then Jade went for a scan to see what stage her cancer was at before being given chemotherapy. I thought I would be at stage two, but I was at stage four, which is the worst it could be, she said.  Once she was diagnosed, Jade quickly started her chemotherapy. She said: In early March I had my first lot of chemotherapy. I had the ABVD drug (a chemotherapy regimen) every two weeks for six months. It wasn\u0027t easy. It was definitely scary. It was the start of a new life for me and everyone around me. After two months I had a scan that said I was in remission. I continued with the chemotherapy and when I had the second scan in August I expected the cancer to be gone but it had gotten worse. The doctor explained that it meant the cancer was aggressive, it was on my spine, ribs, lungs, hip and lymph nodes, basically everywhere. In November and December 2017, Jade began her second stage of treatment and was given a stronger form of chemotherapy. I don\u0027t know if that was the worst or the second worst treatment. Most mornings I was still sick as I arrived at the hospital.  I had a central line in my chest because the drugs were too strong to go through my veins. A tube goes from your chest to the main vein that goes into your heart. In January 2018, Jade had another scan which showed the chemotherapy had had no effect on the cancer. It is horrible to know that you have gone through all that for no change, Jade said. But at the time you don\u0027t know, so you have to do it. After the second treatment failed, Jade was referred to University College Hospital Macmillan in London for her third treatment. If you end up in a life or death situation like mine, this place and the people are amazing. After two months she had another scan but she had mixed results and so was taken off the trial.  Jade was then put on her fourth treatment, which she described as the worst yet. She said: This was probably the worst one, it was horrific. I was meant to be in hospital for six days, but I ended up in there for eight of nine days.  I was collapsing and having problems with my kidneys. I went home for two days, but then had to go back to hospital as I had contracted sepsis. When you have chemotherapy your immune system is lowered, making you more vulnerable to infections. After two weeks, Jade received the second half of this treatment, however another scan showed that these treatments made no impact and the cancer was now in her liver, abdomen and in more areas on her lungs. Jade has been put on a drug called Bendamustine, but has been told by her doctor that this is unlikely to work. Her only option is to raise \u0026pound50,000 for a new drug that could potentially save her life.  She said: Before they even put me on Bendamustine, the doctor told me it was unlikely to work and that I needed to start fundraising. The new drug is called Nivolumab. They think I am chemo resistant, but the new drug works differently to the ones I\u0027ve had so far. My consultant believes it could put my cancer in to remission, which would mean I could finally have a stem cell transplant. However because it is brand new it is too expensive and is not available on the NHS for Hodgkin\u0027s Lymphoma.

Watts is due to appear in court today charged with murdering daughters Bella, four, and Celeste, three and wife Shanann, who was 15-weeks pregnant with a baby boy they were going to name Nico.   Last week he sobbed on TV as he appealed for the return of the trio before allegedly confessing he had killed them.  In a previous case that gripped America, Scott Peterson also reported his wife Laci, who was seven and a half months pregnant with their son Connor, as missing. He gave interviews to the press before being charged with murder. Criminal analyst and forensic investigator Dale Yeager, who is unconnected to Watts\u0027 case, commented on the apparent similarities between the two cases.  He [Watts] has an incredibly large ego, Yeager told People magazine. He was very convincing in front of the camera. He’s Scott Peterson, just less charismatic. Peterson, who is now on death row in Modesto, California, reported his wife Laci missing on Christmas Eve 2002. She was pregnant with their son Connor and she was due on February 10 the following year.  But officers said his behaviour behind the scenes was unusual in that he didn\u0027t seem to care how the investigation was progressing. The lead investigators on Laci\u0027s case, Jon Buehler and Allen Brocchini, spoke to Peterson on Christmas Eve and said they found his behaviour odd. Mr Buehler told ABC News: I suspected Scott when I first met him. Didn\u0027t mean he did it, but I was a little bit thrown off by his calm, cool demeanor and his lack of questioning... He wasn\u0027t, \u0027Will you call me back? Can I have one of your cards? What are you guys doing now?\u0027 Peterson\u0027s affair and financial issues were used by the prosecution as motives for Laci\u0027s murder.  Prosecutors said he murdered his wife because of their mounting debt and he wanted to be single again. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Keith Ablow, who wrote a book about Peterson, told Inside Edition: In every case I have looked at, they all make sense – it may be a terrible kind of sense but the narrative makes sense – that the birth of that child represented a kind of death, an impending death for the man. Peterson was convicted of first-degree murder of his wife and second degree murder of their unborn son in 2004. Fourteen years later Watts stood outside the family home and pleaded for the safe return of his family, who he had already allegedly murdered, following the more recent tragedy. Chris told local news station KMGH: If somebody has her and they’re not safe, I want them back now. That’s what is in my head. If they’re safe right now, they’re going to come back. But if they’re not safe right now, that’s the not-knowing part.  Last night I had every light in the house on, I was hoping that I would just get ran over by the kids just running in and barrel-rushing me, but it didn’t happen. And it was just a traumatic night trying to be here. He reportedly confessed to killing his pregnant wife and daughters and was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder the next day.  A body language expert who closely studied the recordings of the interviews claimed last week they thought it was apparent that the dad was lying.  Lillian Glass told HollywoodLife that Watts\u0027 \u0027spoke too much\u0027 and was giving out too much information.   A former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O\u0027Toole also said his interview showed arrogance and a lack of empathy.

With the little one requiring constant attention, it can be difficult to find time for yourself, let alone for other people. One woman is facing this struggle, as well as the struggle of not knowing anybody else with young children.  She thought she\u0027d finally found a nice group of parenting friends, but the group have just dumped her and the reason why is just bizarre - it\u0027s all to do with cheesecake.    In a post on MumsNet , the mum of a five-month-old, going by the username NoelEdmondsBeard, explained her odd situation and asked for some advice.  She said: I am a new mum and live in a block of flats in a city. I have struggled to meet other mums but by chance bumped into another mum in the lifts one day. We got talking and she invited me to meet other local mums and attend a few baby groups. This was wonderful and provided some good activities for me and bubba. However after a little while, the group stopped being quite so friendly.   The woman continued: Last month she got really cold towards me. Stopped inviting me to get togethers, said she was too busy for a meet up and even blanked me once in our buildings reception. I was perplexed because we had had no argument.   Well I asked what I had done to a new mum (who has become a mutual friend) and she revealed that this friend was upset due to an incident that had occurred at our last get together.  The incident she discovered, was all to do with cheesecake. A buffet was laid out, we had all bought some food, and she had made some home made mini ginger cheesecakes in little ramekins, she explained.  All the other mums were raving about these cheesecakes and she invited me to have one. I took one bite and it was horrible. I forced myself to take another bite but really could not stomach any more.  The other mums had gobbled theirs up, so I thought I could not leave mine uneaten. So I discreetly scooped it up in a napkin and put it in my pocket. Turned out the mum had seen me do this!   She told our mutual friend she had never been so offended and that I was very rude.  The mutual friend suggest that the woman text an apology and buy the cheesecake maker a gift as she was really upset.   She apparently said she wanted a big gesture if she was ever going to be my friend again. She was also upset that she had introduced me to her friendship group yet I had been so snobby to refuse to eat her cheesecake.   I am very embarrassed that she saw me get rid of her cheesecake. But I could not eat it and did not mean to offend.  Part of me thinks she should just accept she makes mushy cheesecake and laugh it off. This is surely not worth ending a friendship over. Is cheesecake such a big deal?  Other parents quickly rushed to support the mum, agreeing that her friend was being unreasonable to act that way over cheesecake. One mum said: She\u0027s no friend. All that fuss over cheesecake, some people thrive on drama. Find some better friends. Another commented: That\u0027s hilarious! I\u0027d be happy to never see her again after that behaviour! I went to a party once where my friend made cupcakes but forgot to put icing sugar in the icing so it was just coloured butter. We all spat them into napkins and hid them in various spots around the house. We still joke about it now and she also saw the funny side when we told her.

Turnbull defeated Dutton in the vote for the leadership of the Liberal Party, the senior party in the centre-right government coalition, by 48 votes to 35, chief government whip Nola Marino told reporters. It came after a sharp fall in opinion poll ratings and talk of an imminent challenge, which in turn has raised the possibility of an early election. Turnbull must return to the polls by May 2019 and could break the impasse by calling an early election. However, a state election in the state of Victoria scheduled for late November is seen limiting Turnbull to dates before the end of October if he intended to hold a national poll this year.  He\u0027s always got that in his back pocket. If it looks like there\u0027s another attempt to dislodge him, he could try to lock his leadership in by taking the coalition to an election, said Nick Economou, senior lecturer in politics at Monash University in Melbourne. A spokesman for Turnbull declined to comment on the prospect of an early election. Turnbull declared the leadership of the government open earlier on Tuesday amid a backbench uprising as opinion polls showed the government on course for a heavy election defeat by the opposition Labor party. His position remains in jeopardy despite surviving Dutton\u0027s leadership challenge, stoking expectations of further political instability in a country that has seen six different leaders since 2009.  We\u0027ve seen it so often in Australian politics - this two-stage act play in removing a prime minister - and, given how close the vote was, there\u0027s definitely more to come, said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia state. Turnbull came to power in a party-room coup in September 2015 when he ousted former prime minister Tony Abbott, who also survived an internal leadership contest before his eventual defeat. Turnbull, a social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker, rode an early wave of popular support but his standing with Australia\u0027s electorate has diminished significantly. He has struggled to appeal to conservative voters, while progressive supporters have been disappointed as they watched government policies shift to the right as Turnbull moved to appease a powerful right-leaning backbench. The uneasy unity held sufficiently to secure a narrow election victory in 2016.

Kay Longstaff\u0027s astonishing story of survival was reported round the world after she was rescued from the Adriatic Sea 60 miles off the Croatian coast .  The 46-year-old air hostess had reportedly spent the evening drinking on the Norwegian Star vessel as it sailed to Venice from the port of Vargarola. She plunged into the sea some time after midnight on Saturday night and spent 10 hours floating before being found by the Croatian coastguard following a frantic rescue mission. Ms Longstaff credited her yoga training for giving her the fitness needed to tread water for so long.  Ms Longstaff told Croatian media she fell off the back of the cruise liner and thanked the wonderful guys who rescued her. But now officials are suggesting Ms Longstaff may have deliberately jumped into the water.  An Italian source told The Sun there was no suggestion of foul play, adding: The theory we are working on is that she most likely jumped.  The boyfriend said they had been drinking and they had quarrelled. He went back to his cabin and left her.   Daniel Punch, a promotions expert for Norwegian Cruise Line, said during a Facebook exchange, according to the Daily Mail : She didn\u0027t fall, she jumped. It was on my ship.  I spoke [to her] throughout the whole week. She was arguing with her fella the whole time. Her disappearance triggered a frantic search after the alarm was raised. The ship turned around to look for her and the coastguard took to the seas in a desperate rescue mision.  A spotter plane eventually located her at 9.45am on Sunday and she was rescued from the 25-degree water. The hospital in Pula confirmed she was physically fine and was excitedly waiting for her boyfriend to come and take her home. A rescuer said Ms Longstaff\u0027s yoga fitness and singing helped her survive: “She (Kay) said the fact she practises yoga helped her as she was fit. “And she said she was singing to not feel cold in the sea overnight.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple share beautiful picture newborn","story":"NewsCouple share beautiful picture of newborn baby girl surrounded by ALL 1,616 needles they used in fertility battleIt took Patricia and Kimberly O\u0027Neill four years, three miscarriages, and 1,616 shots to have their rainbow baby, London - and this image has now become a symbol of hopeShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAmber Hicks14:45, 20 AUG 2018NewsThis picture of London O\u0027Neill has become a symbol of hope (Image: Packer Family Photography)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe undying hope of one couple\u0027s journey to have a baby has been captured in a moving photograph of their newborn daughter surrounded by the 1,616 needles it took to conceive her. Patricia and Kimberly O’Neill faced heartbreak after heartbreak as they spent $40,000, made seven desperate attempts and suffered three miscarriages in their four-year bid to have a baby. But two weeks ago, their pain turned into joy when they welcomed a tiny bundle of joy into the world - a daughter named London O\u0027Neill. The couple, from the US, have now shared a poignant photograph taken of little London wrapped in a rainbow blanket peacefully dozing. But what is more heartrending are the hundreds of needles surrounding her in the shape of a heart.  They represent the blood-thinner needles Patricia used twice a day, and the IVF injections she took in her efforts to have a baby. The photograph has now become a symbol of hope for other parents facing infertility struggles.  I hope that there\u0027s a couple out there that\u0027s going through what we are that can see that there\u0027s hope at the end of the tunnel, Patricia told CNN .  There\u0027s a light and you just have to get there.  It took photographer Samantha Packer more than an hour to meticulously lay out the syringes around London.  She told CNN: The heart symbolized ... that this whole painful journey was all to love a child.  Patricia, 30, who also has a seven-year-old daughter from another relationship, added: My wife saved every single needle that I injected, all capped and plastic seals around them and everything. The couple, from The Sun City, Arizona, met six years ago at a daycare where they both worked. A year into their relationship they started trying for a baby and in 2017 they got married. Kimberly, who works at a bank, also has a 14-year-old son from a past relationship. They both decided it should be Patricia who carried their child. And they admit they thought it would be straight forward but following two rounds of intrauterine insemination, neither were successful. They began IVF but lost one baby at six weeks and another at eight weeks. Doctors then discovered Patricia had a blood-clotting condition. However, a month later she was pregnant with a baby boy. But it ended in more heartache.

I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ac79bfd60c3b.jpg ","title":"former dundee toy shop could become cooking school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA well-known toy shop in Dundee could be transformed into a cooking school.Plans have been submitted to create a cooking school on Commercial Street in the C-listed building that once housed Nappy Pin and Toymaster.The toy stores closed their doors earlier this year after 25 years of trading.Now plans submitted to the council by architect Jon Frullani outline proposals to create a cookery school in the building as well as eight flats in the upper floors of the four-storey premises.If approved, there will also be a cafe alongside the school on the ground floor.The ground floor will contain an open plan kitchen where up to 16 people will be taught to cook at any one time.Food served at the cafe will be prepared in the same kitchen area.Councillors will vote on the new plans at a future planning committee meeting.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/CITY-Amazon-071162.jpg.jpg ","title":"local woman ordered to pay amazon after buying iphone headphones with someone elses bank card","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Tayport woman has been fined £95 and ordered to pay compensation of £100 to Amazon after she admitted obtaining goods from the company using someone else’s debit card.Lori Roache, 22, of Linksfield, admitted inducing the firm into supplying her with a pair of iPhone headphones, at Garvie Brae in Tayport between July 26 and 27 last year, using a debit card in the name of Kathleen Johnstone who she pretended to be.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"meekings grateful to dundee boss mccann for captaincy honour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Dundee captain Josh Meekings has thanked under-fire boss Neil McCann for trusting him with the armband.McCann has confirmed the former Inverness defender will lead out the Dens Park side for the remainder of the season after trying out eight other potential candidates during pre-season.The 25-year-old Englishman says he is grateful for the honour and has vowed to repay McCann \u0026#8211 who is coming under increasing pressure from fans following his side\u0026#8217s shock Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United on Saturday \u0026#8211 with improved performances.He said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m grateful for the manager for pulling me in to tell me I\u0026#8217m going to captain the side.

He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b238ed81901b.jpg ","title":"va feel good factor pushes dundee house prices to record high","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA wave of optimism before the opening of Dundee’s V\u0026ampA museum has pushed average property prices in the city to record levels.The average price for a home is now £142,231 – the highest-ever and up 5.9% compared with last year.The city is one of just eight local authorities in Scotland to see an increase in house prices over the past month.The average, however, is still much lower than Scotland’s other three major cities, with Edinburgh sitting at £273,897, Aberdeen at £200,203, and Glasgow at £158,367.David Groundwater, North East Scotland development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “Traditionally Dundee has always had much lower prices.”The council’s city development convener, Lynne Short, said: “It’s a positive.

Gary is very confident at the minute.“You want your wide players to score goals and provide assists.“Gary did that against St Mirren with two goals and an assist.“It was a very strong performance again from Gary who is enjoying his football.“When he is in that mode, Gary normally impacts positively on results.”Mackay-Steven netted the opener with a volley and then set up a goal for Graeme Shinnie.The winger also won, and converted a penalty –his third goal from the spot already this season.McInnes said: “When Gary is doing flicks, tricks and playing in that mode his confidence is sky high.“And when his confidence is sky high he is difficult to deal with. Gary has four goals already and is a very good finisher.“That is something we identified when we brought him to the club, that he is a calm finisher when he gets into good areas.”Aberdeen blew away St Mirren despite being forced into a change just 20 minutes before kick-off when Niall McGinn was ruled out after picking up a calf injury in the warm-up.Frank Ross was pitched in for his second Dons’ start and impressed.McInnes said: “Frank Ross came in and was told at 2.40pm after Niall went down with his calf injury.“In light of the injuries we have at the minute, it was the last thing we wanted. However, Frank was ready.“He has a remarkable confidence which is really pleasing for me. Frank was very influential.“It was an exceptional performance by the team and we imposed ourselves from the first kick-off.“The movement, speed and intelligence of everyone was really pleasing –but especially at the top end of the pitch.”Aberdeen are set to receive a quadruple boost for Saturday’s league trip to Hibs.Right-back Shay Logan returns from suspension while on-loan Manchester United striker James Wilson is set to shrug off an ankle knock to make his debut on Saturday.On-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban and McGinn are also expected to be fit.McInnes said: “Niall felt a tightness in the warm-up and it was impacting on his movement.

By 1909, Helmrich was producing the postcards of Aberdeen, north-east Scotland and Dundee, taking the total number of view postcards to more than 750.Some of the cards commemorate special occasions such as the first aeroplane flight in the city in 1912 and the unveiling of the King Edward VII statue at the corner of Union Bridge and Union Terrace in 1914.The postcards’ production was stopped following Charles’ death in 1924, aged 84.Dr Cronshaw said: “I became interested in the Adelphi Series of postcards as the images were very well composed and printed to a high standard.“Compositionally they resembled the images produced by the George Washington Wilson Aberdeen photographic firm which was dissolved in 1908.“There was a great rivalry between Valentines Ltd of Dundee and George Washington Wilson Ltd of Aberdeen in the Victorian era but the GWW firm failed to enter the vast postcard market that was opening up.“It was a story that had been overlooked by photograph historians and researchers.”Dr Cronshaw will be taking visitors through the research he has carried out on the firm and family, and the efforts he has put in to find out more about the photographer behind the images.There will also be a number of postcards on display.An Aberdeen City Council spokesman said: “Dr Andrew Cronshaw has done excellent work to discover the history of the Helmrich family and their Aberdeen businesses.“We are delighted to have him speaking here at the Central Library and sharing his research into the creation of these fascinating items.“Historic picture postcards provide a fascinating glimpse at life in the city in times gone by.”The event will take place on Saturday at the Central Library on Rosemount Viaduct from 2-3.30pm. The talk is free to attend, but should be booked.To reserve a space, email LibraryEvents@aberdeencity.gov.uk or call 01224 652500.Photographs of the postcards can also be viewed on Aberdeen City

forward artist impressions in its bid to regenerate Broadford Works in Aberdeen.The former production site, which was once home to the largest collection of A-listed buildings in the country, has laid vacant since 2004.Earlier this year, developers launched a bid to create more than 400 homes in the area, with accommodation for 430 students, shops and office spaces.New details submitted to the local authority include proposals to light up the industrial site’s famous chimneys, and a two-storey extension to the top of the largest building, the Red Mill.Images created by Inhabit also include how Hutcheon Street could look following the redevelopment, with buildings raised around the road’s chimney stack and a large housing development behind a red brick facade.The Grey Mill, which dates back to 1808 and is one of the oldest iron-framed mills in Scotland, and the fourth oldest known in the world, is still earmarked for partial demolition, due to it being unsafe and unfeasible to retain the building in its entirety.Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart said: “The people living in the area will be pleased to see development finally taking place at Broadford, as they have had to deal with years of vandalism, arson and disruption.“Many of the plans and graphics seem to show that much of the heritage will be retained, and that is good news.“However, it is extremely unfortunate that the Grey Mill cannot be fully retained, and in my opinion everything possible must be done to retain this historic building.”North-east MSP Lewis Macdonald added: “Broadford Works has been neglected for far too long, and the longer they lie unused the greater the risk that all their historical value will be lost as a result of dilapidation and wilful fire-raising.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"old clothes and metal removed in aberdeen beach clean up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tClothes and scrap metal were among the items found during a clean-up operation

people are on board with protecting local wildlife.“This weekend’s activities mark the end of our viewing programme for the season, which has celebrated how easy it is for local residents and visitors to the city to enjoy watching the local pods of bottlenose dolphins leap, play and surf the waves.“We’re extremely grateful to the ScottishPower Foundation for supporting the initiative, which is giving people in Aberdeen the chance to get involved with our conservation work and will help protect the area and its amazing wildlife.”More than 3,000 visits have been made to the coastal vantage point at Torry Battery since Dolphinwatch launched in May to learn about and catch a glimpse of the harbour’s abundant wildlife.In addition to the sociable pods of bottlenose dolphins that regularly visit the harbour, visitors have been treated to sightings of ospreys, puffins and even minke and humpback whales in their natural habitat.Ann McKechin, trustee and executive officer at the ScottishPower Foundation, said: “The beach clean is a fantastic example of everyone coming together to help protect the habitats of the incredible wildlife that lives in this part of Scotland.“We’re delighted to help support the RSPB Scotland Dolphinwatch programme and you can already see a deep connection with marine wildlife.“The foundation is very much looking forward to seeing young people

safety at a school.Greenburn Road, Greenburn Drive, Waterton Road and Lade Crescent in Bankhead will all be affected by traffic measures which have been put in place, designed to boost safety around the newly completed Stoneywood School.A prohibition of waiting has been imposed on Greenburn Road and Greenburn Drive, 10 metres on either side of the junction between the two roads.Meanwhile, a 20mph speed limit has been introduced on Waterton Road and Lade Crescent.The order, which started last week, is due to be in place until July 11 next year.According to the order by Aberdeen City Council, the measure is being taken to protect public safety while a permanent traffic regulation is put in place.The order states: “The measures are necessary to ensure road safety around the new school while a permanent traffic regulation order is progressed.”The new Stoneywood Primary, which cost £13 million, is due to accept its first pupils this week.Lord Provost Barney Crockett, who represents the Dyce, Bucksburn and Danestone ward, said: “This is all part of the process for setting up the new school in the area.“The safety of the children is always paramount. Residents I think will be patient and know that this is for the safety of the children at the school.“They will be pleased that there will be a new school at the site and not a vacant or derelict site which we had for some time.“The quicker we get a permanent traffic order in place at the sites the better.”The school has the capacity to house 434 pupils and will also include a nursery.It is on the site of the former Bankhead Academy which was destroyed by a fire in 2012.Funding for the new school was allocated by the council’s five-year capital programme.Ross Grant, Aberdeen City Council spokesman for transport, said: “The safety of our pupils is a top priority and, as the opening of the £13m state-of-the-art Stoneywood school nears, a traffic order has been raised that will see various traffic restrictions in place.“This will ensure that pupils have the opportunity to safely make their way to school, which I welcome.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback. Having a full programme of events in the arena as well as lots workshops for adults and youngsters to take part in throughout the day, has really made a big difference this year.\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216I would like to give a special mention to the 19th Argyll Scouts, the MS Centre and Lochgilphead Parish Church, without whom I\u0026#8217d have had no marquees, tables or chairs, and to Bluestone Gift Shop, the Grubs Up Recovery Cafe and the new Scottish Canals Steamer Terminal in Ardrishaig who all stepped in on the day before the festival with the additional funding and sponsorship that I needed to ensure the full scale festival could go ahead as planned.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217d also like to thank all the performers, providers and other contributors for making such a great day and would especially like to thank the volunteers who helped set up the site on Friday night and took everything down and away on Saturday evening.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m already thinking of ways to make the festival even bigger and better next year.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Over the years, while working towards the awards, Myles has learned to play the accordion and now regularly enjoys playing in a band.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

Four examples of these keeps survive in a ruinous state around Innerleithen and Traquair.\nThe walls themselves cannot speak so I have turned to Innerleithen \u0026amp Traquair, Past and Present, with an Angler\u0026rsquos Guide to the Tweed and its Tributaries (Second Edition \u0026ndash 1867), commonly called Smail\u0026rsquos Guide as it was published by Innerleithen printer Robert Smail.\nElibank Castle: \u0026ldquoAbout a mile east of Bold is Juniper Bank, near which \u0026ndash a considerable way up the hill \u0026ndash is the ruin of Elibank Tower, the ancient seat of the Murrays of Elibank, and famous for the story of Muckle-mouthed Meg, in which young Scott of Harden figured so conspicuously. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 96)\nCardrona Tower: \u0026ldquo...Cardrona was for many ages...the property of a family of the name of Govan, chiefs of the name, one of whom, Laurence of Govan, was Sheriff of Traquair in 1358. They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.

East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

The team\u0026rsquos other coach is Chris Moffat, who used to play youth football for Musselburgh Windsor and, after a spell at St Johnstone, now plays for Dunbar United.  The pair are keen to find out more about the history of the Wallyford Bluebell club.  Mr Learmonth said: \u0026ldquoWe are reviving a famous old East Lothian side, Wallyford Bluebell FC.  \u0026ldquoWe have received lots of keen interest from people who once played for, or who have a member of their family who once played for, The Bluebell.  \u0026ldquoIdeally, we are hoping to attract all ages to come along and support our revival of this old club. Similarly, we\u0026rsquore very keen for any Courier readers to get in touch with us to give us details of their time at The Bluebell.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe majority of the current squad is made up from lads who have spent between five to 15 years playing youth football at Musselburgh Windsor.  \u0026ldquoThis band of brothers are excited at this new attempt to revive The Bluebell and would love to see some of the ex-players along to shout them on.  \u0026ldquoWe will be attempting to play all our home games at Wallyford playing fields, normally with a 2pm kick-off.  \u0026ldquoSo far we have played a few of the East Lothian sides in some friendlies and won every game.  The team played its final friendly match of the season last Sunday, ending in a 2-2 draw against Easthouses.  A race night at Wallyford Miners Welfare Society \u0026amp Social Club has already raised \u0026pound1,000 for funds, with sponsorship for home and away strips coming from local businesses Michael Moffat of Platinum Plumbing and Heating Svs and Callum Innes Electrical Solutions.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8207400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons. I have seen for myself on lots of occasions the great atmosphere in the existing nursery, and have watched that reflected in the many national awards Pear Tree has won for the quality of their provision.  \u0026ldquoI was delighted to help open the new Pear Tree on West Road. This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263378.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263446.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people. That is the best way to learn what makes the school tick, the young people and the staff tick.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, East Lothian Council spokeswoman for education and children\u0026rsquos services and a Haddington ward councillor, said: \u0026ldquoI was delighted when Susan Cook was appointed as headteacher of Knox Academy.  \u0026ldquoShe brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the school from her posts in Edinburgh, which include Trinity Academy.  \u0026ldquoI welcome her to the East Lothian team and look forward to supporting her at the school as the local ward councillor."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263472.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-dunbar-grammar-school-headteacher-hails-magical-community","story":"  Claire Slowther took the helm on Monday after succeeding the now-retired Paul Raffaelli, who had been headteacher for more than a decade.  Mrs Slowther, previously one of the school\u0026rsquos depute headteachers, was looking forward to the new term, with pupils starting back at school on Wednesday.  She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny. It is a sunny, cheerful, caring place \u0026ndash within the classrooms, corridors and out in the community.  \u0026ldquoWhen parents come in, they are so friendly and supportive as well.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263580.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

It is expected to be given the green light for routine NHS use on Wednesday by health watchdog Nice (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).  One in three men over the age of 50 suffer from symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which can include needing to visit the toilet more frequently and with more urgency and experiencing difficulty emptying their bladder.  Many men will undergo an operation to relieve the condition, called a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), but this can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, incontinence and sexual dysfunction.  The steam treatment, called Rezum, avoids the need for invasive surgery and is said to carry fewer side effects.  Water vapour at a temperature of about 103C is injected into the prostate for between eight and 10 seconds, with the heat destroying some of the prostate tissue and reducing its size.  Professor Hashim Ahmed, chair in Urology at Imperial College London and a consultant at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, began trialling the treatment last year.  Speaking at the time, he said: \u0026ldquoThis treatment will not only be a better alternative for men facing a longer procedure with added recovery time but we can also offer it to those who are on life-long medication who opted not to have surgery because they were worried about side effects of traditional surgery.  A consultation document on the procedure published by Nice earlier this year made draft recommendations that stated current evidence was \u0026ldquoadequate to support the use of this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit.  The final guidance will be published on Wednesday."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7067548.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coronation-streets-jim-mcdonald-swaps-broad-northern-irish-tones-for-scottish-accent","story":"  But Charles Lawson is set to take on another iconic role when he plays Inspector Rebus in a new touring stage production.  Fans of the gruff detective created by author Ian Rankin can see the Northern Irish actor, 58, follow in the footsteps of John Hannah and Ken Stott when he portrays the hardbitten Edinburgh case-cracker.  Edinburgh-based Rankin, who has penned more than 20 Rebus novels, said: \u0026ldquoCharles was mooted and I thought I would get a few comments from Scottish fans, because he\u0026rsquos from Northern Ireland, said Ian.  \u0026ldquoThe play\u0026rsquos producer and Rona Munro, who I\u0026rsquove written the story with, had seen him on stage and both said he was terrific. He is an actor and actors can do voices, plus he\u0026rsquos worked in Scotland before and everyone is sure he can do it.  \u0026ldquoHe has the physical presence needed and he can certainly act like Rebus would act. Plus he\u0026rsquos a big name \u0026ndash people who might not like Rebus but enjoy a night at the theatre will see Charlie Lawson is in it and might come along.  \u0026ldquoThere have been so many incarnations of the character \u0026ndash two on television, and many more doing the audiobooks and radio \u0026ndash so he isn\u0026rsquot set in stone. Every actor brings something different to the role, which is interesting to me as the writer. Of course, I have my own version of Rebus in my head. \u0026ldquo Rankin has yet to meet the new Rebus due to their busy schedules.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried a few times but it\u0026rsquos not happened as of yet. I\u0026rsquom going down to Birmingham, where the play opens, next month and I have tickets for the first night in Edinburgh, too \u0026ndash my wife surprised me with tickets for my birthday.

The Scot inherited a Premier League-winning winning squad, but could only guide United to seventh the following season and was sacked before the close of the 2013/14 campaign.  Ferdinand says that Moyes, who is now in the running for the US national team manager\u0027s position, introduced a new mentality into the dressing room that proved a shock at Old Trafford.    \"Even the mindset in one of the training sessions, I hope I\u0027m not speaking out of line here toward David Moyes, but our mindset we were never worried about the opposition [before],\" said the former England international.  \"We never set out thinking we need to contain the opposition, we\u0027re going to try and win this game based on what we\u0027re good at.  \"But I remember the first couple of games against Liverpool and Chelsea, we were talking more about Hazard and Coutinho than we were about our own attacking tactics.  \"There\u0027s doubt and players there looking at each other thinking \u0027This isn\u0027t us.

Put us on the front foot and let us go out and attack these players\u0027.  \"I think that mindset came from being an Everton manager. Moyes in the big games played first not to get beat, then to see what we could get from the game. Before we were always on the front foot.    \"Yes we were aware of the opposition but with the mentality of going there to win.\"  Ferdinand told BT Sports\u0027s Premier League Tonight show: \"I could have always been better as a player, definitely.  \"But in terms of support for him [Moyes] or wanting him to do well or wanting things to go the right way there\u0027s no question in my mind that I was there behind him in all aspects.

EU member states, including Germany and France, have been among dozens of countries which expelled Russian diplomats following March\u0027s Novichok nerve agent attack on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, which also resulted in the death of a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, in June.  Yet some have since reached out to President Vladimir Putin with Emmanuel Macron, the French President, travelling to St Petersburg to call on Russia to work \"hand-in-hand\" with Europe and Italy questioning whether sanctions imposed over the 2014 annexation of Crimea should continue.  The Secretary of State\u0026rsquos visit also follows the historic and controversial summit between Donald Trump and Mr Putin in Helsinki, which led to widespread criticism of the US President.  In a speech at the US Institute of Peace, Mr Hunt is due to say that, under Mr Putin, Russia\u0027s \"aggressive and malign behaviour undermines the international order that keeps us safe\" and its foreign policy has \u0026ldquomade the world a more dangerous place.  He will go on: \"And today, the United Kingdom asks its allies to go further by calling on the European Union to ensure its sanctions against Russia are comprehensive and that we truly stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the US.  \"That means calling out and responding to transgressions with one voice whenever and wherever they occur, from the streets of Salisbury to the fate of Crimea.\"  The Secretary of State will also warn the West\u0026rsquos democratic model is \u0026ldquodeclining in attractiveness for too many people with many voters since the financial crash of 2008 starting to question globalisation and rejecting political leaders they associate as defending it.  While he will insist the heart of democracy is freedom of expression, Mr Hunt will point to how the \u0026ldquoubiquity of fake news, social media targeting and foreign attempts to manipulate elections have undermined confidence that this can actually happen.  Yet he warns against \u0026ldquoputting our heads in the sand to blame social media by pretending some of the causes of social resentment are not real whether caused by the \"decline in real incomes for many Americans and Europeans, dislocation caused by changes in technology or the identity concerns of many voters caused by immigration.

Official figures released in June showed exports of UK goods and services hit a record \u0026pound620 billion last year, accounting for almost a third of UK GDP.  In a speech to a business audience in London launching the Government\u0027s new export strategy, Dr Fox is expected to say: \"UK businesses are superbly placed to capitalise on the rapid changes in the global economic environment and the UK has the potential to be a 21st century exporting superpower.  \"As an international economic department, we are determined to support, connect and grow UK companies on the world stage through our international network.  \"As we leave the EU, we must set our sights high and that is just what this export strategy will help us achieve,\" the Scot will declare.  The Trade Department noted how research showed that companies, which exported, had increased growth potential, were more productive and had better paid jobs.  Last year, UK exports posted a record high with \u0026pound620bn of goods and services sold abroad by British companies, accounting for 30 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos wealth creation.  Yet the Department estimates 400,000 businesses believe they could export but do not while demand for British expertise and goods overseas is growing.  Announcing a \u0026ldquonew national drive to export, Baroness Fairhead, the Trade Minister, said: \u0026ldquoAs the world\u0026rsquos sixth largest exporter, we do punch above our weight however, we also punch below our potential.  \u0026ldquoThis Export Strategy sets out to change that and to increase exports as a proportion of GDP from 30 to 35 per cent, taking us from the middle of the G7 to near the top. This is ambitious but achievable, she insisted.  Mike Cherry, the National Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Government\u0027s export strategy was \"strong on aspiration\" and welcomed the commitment to increase exports as a proportion of GDP and other measures which could support small firms.  \"Incentives like export vouchers and grants should be made available to small businesses to help them with upfront investment costs for things like translation services or additional market research.  \"An assessment of financial incentives, including export vouchers, as mentioned in the strategy, is a step in the right direction, but we are fast running out of time, he warned.  Mr Cherry added: \"The clock is ticking. If the Government doesn\u0027t act quickly and introduce financial incentives there is a risk the current uncertainty will have a serious and detrimental impact on the growth of small businesses.\"  Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said: \"This strategy is a timely signal that the Government is committed to improving the United Kingdom\u0027s international competitiveness.  \"The CBI strongly supports the ambition to make exports 35 per cent of GDP, which will put the UK out in front of many of our international competitors.  She added: \"We estimate that in every region of the country there are around 10 per cent of businesses that could export but don\u0027t and we look forward to working alongside the Government to support and inspire them to seize the opportunity.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-admits-to-worrying-about-contributing-to-woes-of-world","story":"  The First Minister also described the world as often a dark and \u0026ldquoworrying place at present.  Ms Sturgeon made the comments at the Edinburgh International Book Festival while hosting a talk with the novelist Ali Smith, whom she called \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos greatest living writer.  The First Minister was reflecting after reading a passage from Ms Smith\u0026rsquos recent novel Autumn about the divisions in society left by the EU referendum and Brexit.  Ms Sturgeon, who is due to make an announcement on a second independence referendum in October, said: \u0026ldquoAs a politician, I\u0026rsquom acutely aware \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos something I think about a lot \u0026ndash that politicians, by definition, [are] opinionated. We put forward strong views and policies.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore sometimes the cause, or a cause, of the division. Also, how we communicate now seems to reinforce those divisions. It pushes people to take sides and simplifies things.  Although Ms Sturgeon mostly put the questions to Ms Smith, the author also asked the First Minister, a voracious reader, what happened when she read a book. Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoA whole variety of different things. Sometimes the ability to escape and switch off from whatever it is that\u0026rsquos worrying me at the time.  \u0026ldquoIf there was one thing I could make compulsory for leaders across the world it would be to read fiction. For me fiction, much more than non-fiction, allows situations that I have no direct experience of to be really conjured up and for me to develop an understanding in a way that is different to reading non-fiction.  After Ms Smith referred to President Trump and political lying, Ms Sturgeon said most people would recognise the world \u0026ldquoto some extent [as] a dark place just now, a worrying place.  The two were speaking in conversation at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, where Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that politicians were often the cause of such division.  She said: \u0026ldquoAs a politician I\u0026rsquom acutely aware, and it\u0026rsquos something I think about a lot, that politicians by definition we\u0026rsquore opinionated, we put forward strong views on policies, we\u0026rsquore sometimes the cause or a cause of the division.  \u0026ldquoAlso how we communicate now seems to reinforce those divisions, it pushes people to take sides and simplify things.  \u0026ldquoIs there a case right now that either through the form of the novel or the perspective of the writer, that perspective is actually much much more needed than perhaps has been in our lifetimes?  The author saidMs Smith responded: \u0026ldquoThe novel is a unifying force. All art reminds us to engage and it reminds us to enter \u0026ndash even just with itself \u0026ndash dialogue. Dialogue is the source of life.  \u0026ldquoThe point at which you actually talk to somebody, rather than block a story... that\u0026rsquos coming from someone else, the point at which the stories meet and become one story instead of separate stories on competing sides of the walls and fences \u0026ndash which politics across the world at the moment is not just threatening us with, but building.  Ms Smith said this was \u0026ldquothe darkest time that I\u0026rsquove ever lived in, adding: \u0026ldquoIn our lives, across the world from this country outwards, from the UK outwards it\u0026rsquos a dark, dark premise.  \u0026ldquoWith nobody interested in the UK Government in those splits... to try to heal the thing that is revealed by Brexit. Everybody vying for power in a way that is absolutely terrifying.  But she told the First Minister, who said most would recognise to some extent the current time as \u0026ldquoa dark place, a worrying place that the novel was ultimately a form that gave hope for the future.  Nick Barley, Book Festival director, provoked laughter when he thanked Ms Sturgeon for being a \u0026ldquoprime minister who reads, before correcting it to First Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-the-people-have-voted-and-the-result-must-be-allowed-to-stand","story":"  A lot of the people who voted Remain are saying that, if anything, their dire predictions understated matters financial calamity is certain, there will be a hard border within the UK and we\u0026rsquoll be so cut off from EU trade that there will be shortages of everything from food to medicine.  Hundreds rally in Edinburgh, and a millionaire pledges money for a push for a second vote, in the hope that people will change their minds. Polling suggests that rising numbers (48 per cent at the last count) would like another referendum on the final deal.  I say imagine because, though all that is happening now, I\u0026rsquom thinking of a similar situation in an alternate version of 2016, two years after Scotland narrowly voted to leave the United Kingdom. Leavers predicted an oil boom worth \u0026pound57 billion, based on a price around $150 a barrel the oil price is now (as it was in the real 2016) falling, and currently below $25 a barrel.  The EU is insisting that either Scotland effectively abandons the main elements of independence or has a hard border with England. Half the Leavers now want a very soft independence deal (devo ++) the other half want the hardest possible exit. Unionists think that by telling everyone disaster is looming, just enough people will change their minds in a second vote. Everyone on both sides is astonished that nobody seems to have thought about any of the details.  Does another go at the referendum, in such circumstances, sound like a recipe for improving the situation? Or like a desperate bid by increasingly hysterical losers to overturn a democratic decision with breathtaking assertions about future catastrophes which are entirely hypothetical?  Both Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of the Superdry clothing chain, who is giving \u0026pound1 million to the campaign for a \u0026ldquoPeople\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash so-called, presumably, because it is designed to reverse the vote the people have already cast \u0026ndash and the unofficial Leave campaign\u0026rsquos Arron Banks, who claims to have drummed up \u0026pound2 million to depose Theresa May and abandon her deal (whatever it might be) in favour of a hard Brexit, are throwing money at equally chimerical problems.  The simple point about both the Brexit and independence referendums is that they were democratic decisions about the future. And no one knew or knows now what will happen in the future.  That\u0026rsquos as true of the \u0026ldquoremain side of both votes as the \u0026ldquoleave the only status quo that remains exactly the same forever is the band. In real life, Remainers were signing up to the future direction of travel of the UK or the EU with no more certainty about it than Leavers had about the future outside either union.  That is why all counterfactual claims are worthless and unverifiable. Claims that, for example, the UK economy has grown less than it would have done if we\u0026rsquod stayed in the EU are neither true nor false \u0026ndash they are meaningless, because we don\u0026rsquot know what would have happened had the vote gone the other way. For the same reason, we can\u0026rsquot know whether any of the \u0026ldquoProject Fear claims made in the independence referendum would have come about.  We can guess that the fall in the oil price would have put paid to the SNP\u0026rsquos pre-referendum predictions, and point out that Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos oil boom didn\u0026rsquot happen. But even if we think it likely, we can\u0026rsquot say with certainty that economic disaster would have followed, or that an independent Scotland would be worse off because it didn\u0026rsquot happen.  So we can\u0026rsquot assess whether people are worse off or growth is lower than would have been the case if the Brexit vote had gone the other way. What we can know is that the vast majority of the predictions made by the Remain campaign about what would happen immediately after the vote were not only wrong, but the reverse of what did happen.  Unemployment did not go up by 500,000, but fell to its lowest level since 1975. Interest rates did not rise, but fell. Foreign investment in the UK increased, as did the number of foreign students. There was not, as George Osborne assured us there would be, an \u0026ldquoimmediate recession with four quarters of negative growth the economy grew every quarter, and UK growth is currently higher than Eurozone growth. There has been no enormous exodus of capital or foreign firms.  All those things could, of course, happen in the future, along with plenty of other bad things. But their failure to materialise so far is not a compelling argument for believing that those who wrongly predicted them now have access to a better crystal ball.  Naturally, Remain voters regret the result. It\u0026rsquos even reasonable that some Leave voters might now vote differently. Votes, however, are not conducted on the basis of time travel, or \u0026ldquoif I had known then what I know now. No one could have known, to take the most obvious example, that Theresa May would be the worst prime minister in living memory, and making a pig\u0026rsquos ear of the negotiations.  But the case being made by campaigners for a second referendum is not even that. They know now no more than they knew at the time of the vote. Their earlier warnings having been disproved, they are just shouting other ones, more loudly. Some, such as Professor AC Grayling, Lord Adonis, and the former BBC journalist Gavin Esler, now resemble the demented 19th-Century Millerites who were constantly predicting the Apocalypse, and changing the date when it failed to turn up.  Even if you calculate that the current Government is bound to mess things up, the solution would not be to reverse a democratic decision before it been implemented it would be to get rid of the government. A rally of several hundreds of Remainers in Edinburgh at the height of the Festival, and even the 650,000-odd signatures on a petition calling for a \u0026ldquoRight Kind of People\u0026rsquos Vote should not invalidate the biggest popular vote for anything ever, and especially not before it has even happened."},{"url":null,"title":"school-workers-exposed-to-asbestos-after-manager-forgets-incident","story":"  Staff including teachers, janitors, cleaners and other workers were on Aberdeen\u0026rsquos Bridge of Don Academy premises in the days following the incident last month, according to BBC Scotland.

Concern was then raised about the material being removed and the conclusion was reached that it possibly contained asbestos.  The material was double-bagged and left beside a skip. On July 19, results from samples confirmed the presence of brown asbestos in the insulating board.  The report obtained by the BBC says the site was \u0026ldquonot safe as the area had \u0026ldquonot been correctly decontaminated and isolated to prevent access by other users of the building.  It states: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five persons comprising employees, sub-contractors, janitors, teachers and cleaners have been identified as being on the premises from 12-17 July.  And on the \u0026ldquoemergency response failures, it says: \u0026ldquoOnce the site supervisor notified his line manager about the potential disturbance of AIB (asbestos containing material) on 12 July, existing procedure was not initiated by the site manager because he was following instructions from his line manager.  \u0026ldquoLine manager did not initiate procedure because he forgot about the incident until 17 July.  A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council said: \u0026ldquoThe health, safety and wellbeing of staff, pupils, contractors and all visitors to schools is a priority and Aberdeen City Council has robust policies, procedures and training in place in relation to asbestos.  \u0026ldquoThe incident has been the subject of an internal investigation and the council is supporting the Health and Safety Executive as it conducts its independent investigation.

According to Glasgow council leader Susan Aitken, plans to improve transport links are already under way, and could transform the way supporters travel to Scotland matches and cup finals.  Transport issues have been a common area of complaint from football fans and people attending events at the stadium.  Bosses from the SFA are due to make a final decision next Wednesday on whether to shift showpiece internationals and cup finals away from their traditional home to BT Murrayfield in Edinburgh.  It could bring an end to more than a century of international football history and heritage linked to the 52,000-seat stadium, as well as have dire consequences for current owners, Queens Park.  The SFA currently rents Hampden under a lease with the Ladbroke\u0026rsquos League Two side, which is set to expire in 2020. Although it has an option to renew the lease, football\u0026rsquos governing body opted to explore alternatives.  While Queen\u0026rsquos Park are reported to be willing to sell their property to the SFA for \u0026pound6 million, rugby chiefs believe they have the credentials to lure the SFA from their home since 1906.  Dominc McKay, the SRU\u0026rsquos chief operating officer, said: \u0026ldquoI think we\u0026rsquove got a great chance. We\u0026rsquove had brilliant discussions with our colleagues at the SFA at every level, whether that is financial, commercial, marketing or security.  \u0026ldquoIn every element we\u0026rsquove spent a lot of time with them and will be hosting them again shortly.

Don\u0026rsquot take my word for it, take the hundreds of thousands of people who came through our turnstiles last year and the year before. People who come to Murrayfield have a great experience, whether that be Hearts who played four games last year there or the opposition who got a couple of wins.  \u0026ldquoI think our changing-room facilities, our media facilities and our facilities for the athletes are better than anything else in Scotland. We have a great bid, we\u0026rsquove certainly put our best foot forward and we look forward to hearing how we get on.  Glasgow City Council chiefs yesterday insisted they were working to resolve transport issues, which have historically dogged fans attempting to reach the stadium.  The main route is via train from Glasgow Central to Mount Florida, or bus along Aikenhead Road or Cathcart Road. Fans have complained the stadium is not accessible, with long queues for trains, traffic jams on surrounding roads and limited parking.  In a letter to the SFA president, Ms Aitken said work was currently under way to make further improvements.  She said: \u0026ldquoMost notable is the South City Way, which is building safer, more comfortable, faster and more coherent cycle and walking routes from Queen\u0026rsquos Park to the Merchant City. Within two years, the experience for walkers, cyclists and public transport users will be unrecognisable. Coupled with signage and promotion, this will go a considerable way towards delivering the Hampden Stride and improving the experience of walking to and from the stadium.  \u0026ldquoThe council is participating with Hampden Park and transport stakeholders on a transport working group to put in place an Event Transport Plan, which will make travelling by public transport to international games, domestic cup matches and concerts at Hampden markedly better."},{"url":null,"title":"australian-pm-malcolm-turnbull-survives-leadership-vote","story":"  His challenger, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, resigned from Cabinet after the vote but the amount of support he gained a day after downplaying the possibility of a challenge surprised many commentators.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

He was part of a satirical group which included caricatures of American president Donald Trump as well as his Russian and North Korean counterparts Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un.\u0026ldquoIt was poking fun at celebrities, according to one gala onlooker. \u0026ldquoThere was nothing racist about it. If this is seen as offensive then we are pushing the boat too far out on political correctness.\u0026ldquoIt will get to the stage where you can\u0026rsquot express any kind of political protest or satire.Wick gala committee, which organises the week-long event, was reluctant to get involved in the row.A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe were disappointed it was the national and regional press which got in touch on the issue and not the public.The committee members, she pointed out, attend meetings starting in January to organise the gala and this week have been at events \u0026ldquoall through the day and night. One member was counting money until the early hours of yesterday morning.It is understood a complaint about Lidl Wayne was made by a Wicker living in Edinburgh and triggered the negative coverage.But there was a backlash from local people. James Macmillan stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh obviously dilutes the sense of humour and common sense. Political correctness gone mad.Myra Blake wrote: \u0026ldquoThis is absolutely ridiculous the fuss over this, it is all harmless fun.

It may be possible at some point to have a junior games.The idea will be taken into secondary schools to start with, although in the longer term primaries would be included as well.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding. All that stress is worth it.\u0026#8221A fundraising web page for the swim is available here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We\u0026rsquore always working together as a community so we feel positive about this award.\"Alness entered the awards last time around but lost out to Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire.However, it is no stranger to national competitions having won Britain in Bloom five times and Scotland in Bloom on four occasions.Ms Wilson, who is also a local Highland councillor, said the High Street offered a great all-round shopping experience.\"We have lots of independent shops and very few chain shops,\" she said.\"Morrisons and Lidl work well with the High Street. They give people their food shopping but they don\u0026rsquot tend to compete with the independent shops.\"They try to work hand-in-hand.\"Last year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards were a big success with hundreds of High Streets being entered.Jamie Stone, Liberal Democrat MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, said Alness was this year\u0026rsquos obvious winner.He said: \"Alness High Street is a beacon of hope for all of us who worry about the decline in our town centres.\"It is a tribute to the fantastic work put in by local people and they richly deserve to win the top prize.\"The awards are run by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and were launched to celebrate local achievements on UK high streets.As well as recognising the best high streets, the awards also aim to celebrate the individual businesses and people who play a \"leading role in making our high streets special\".Andrew Percy MP, parliamentary under-secretary of state and minister for high streets, said: \"The awards are a great opportunity to recognise and celebrate the efforts of small businesses, dedicated individuals and community groups in our area who work hard to make our High Streets great.\"There\u0026rsquos also a chance to win up to \u0026pound10,000 to spend on the local community.\"Applications will close on August 22.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There was no emergency response to the discovery at Bridge of Don Academy in Aberdeen because a line manager “forgot” about it for five days, the council investigation found.            The redacted report, obtained by the BBC, said teachers, janitors, cleaners and other workers were allowed to enter the school after the asbestos was discovered due to a series of failings.            The material was uncovered during maintenance work on 12 July, when a worker was using a hammer and chisel to remove plasterboard above a set of fire doors.Concerns were soon raised that the material might contain asbestos, but emergency procedures were not activated until 17 July. In the intervening period it was simply double-bagged and left by a skip. The report said the site was “not safe” as the area had “not been correctly decontaminated and isolated to prevent access by other users of the building”.After an emergency was declared, a clean up of the area was ordered. Two vehicles which had been used were quarantined so they could be deep cleaned. Samples from the material later confirmed that they contained brown asbestos, but the report criticised the delay between the discovery and the site being locked down.“Twenty five persons comprising employees, sub-contractors, janitors, teachers and cleaners have been identified as being on the premises from 12-17 July,” the report said.            Describing a series of “emergency response failures”, it added: “Once the site supervisor notified his line manager about the potential disturbance of AIB [asbestos containing material] on 12 July, existing procedure was not initiated by the site manager because he was following instructions from his line manager.“Line manager did not initiate procedure because he forgot about the incident until 17 July.”The report concluded: “Throughout the project, planning has been poor.”A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council said: “The incident at Bridge of Don Academy has been the subject of an internal investigation and the council is supporting the Health and Safety Executive as it conducts its independent investigation.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4785643.1534495588!/image/image.jpg","title":"investor calls for seats on board of faroe","story":"        Aberdeen-based oil and gas firm Faroe Petroleum yesterday hit out at what it described as a shareholder\u0026#8217s attempt to take control of the company on the cheap.                Norwegian energy firm DNO, which owns just over 28 per cent of Faroe, has requisitioned a meeting of Faroe’s shareholders in an attempt to get its chairman and managing director seats on the board. In a strongly worded response, Faroe’s board said it was “very concerned” by DNO’s action.

BBC Scotland\u0026#8217s head of public policy dismisses claims of increasing public disquiet over alleged bias at the BBC.                “Facts are chiels that winna ding, An downa be disputed.”            If only our national Bard’s words held as true today as they did when he first put pen to paper in 1786. Sadly, in an age where social media is, for many, the communication vehicle of choice, facts are ‘dinged’ on a regular basis and it is increasingly commonplace for the distinctions to be blurred between that which can be verified and that which is simply the stuff of rumour, opinion or even deliberate fabrication.            Earlier this year, the Edelman Trust Barometer, which measures trust across a number of institutions, job sectors and geographical areas, found that over 50 per cent of us worry about fake news. It also revealed that 64 per cent of those interviewed for the survey said they could not distinguish between proper journalism and that which was fake. That must be a cause for concern for us all.In such an environment, where the amount of social media content grows exponentially, day on day, where views are increasingly becoming more polarised and voices more strident in an effort to be heard above the ‘din’, it is not easy for the BBC to stand apart and remain immune. Indeed, as a broadcaster, we are often the subject (some might say ‘target‘) of much of the discourse, with questions regularly asked of our impartiality and independence. The events of the last few weeks have again thrown that discourse into sharp relief.Three weeks ago, alerted to BBC content being posted online without authorisation, action was taken to address what was seen as a copyright infringement by a number of websites. That, in turn, prompted a flurry of correspondence, commentary and criticism, much of it channelled via social media and, indeed, via the media at large (including the BBC’s own television and radio news outlets). The BBC reacted, determining, rightly, that the proper course of action would be to review its practices in respect of ‘political’ content being posted online by third parties and to withdraw its complaints about such postings (action will continue to be taken where pirated copies of BBC content such as comedies and dramas are posted online).Some saw this as an opportune moment to rekindle their arguments about the BBC’s ‘institutional bias’, to give voice once again to their perceptions of a pro-Unionist, pro-establishment, anti-independence stance which they believe the BBC not only embodies but actively promotes. And the arguments, for and against, raged, not only on social media but also in the columns and letters pages of parts of the press.            Indeed, Lesley Riddoch, in her Perspective article (Monday, 13 August) drew attention to what was characterised as a compendium of concerns laid at the door of the BBC, illustrating what she described as increasing public disquiet over its alleged pro-Labour/anti-Nationalist bias, its anti-Labour/Jeremy Corbyn bias, its pro-Conservative bias, the desertion of ‘liberals and lefties’ from the Today Programme audience, a similar desertion by them – and by supporters of Scottish independence – from the Question Time audience...READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: BBC struggles to accept Scottish independence isn’t a ‘phase’If Lesley is to be believed, I’m surprised anyone, anywhere, is now watching or listening to BBC programmes! But then again, if we are so busy manipulating our news content in favour of one cause or another, maybe we just haven’t noticed that there’s no-one out there consuming it...Frankly, I don’t buy it. Because it isn’t true. The truth of the matter is that audiences do still consume BBC programmes and content. In Scotland. And in great numbers. And they’re not doing that because they don’t trust what they are seeing or hearing. Quite the contrary.            Recent reports from Ipsos Mori and the Oxford University Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism on digital news both saw BBC ranked top for impartial news and as the most trusted news source when compared to other broadcasters, print outlets and social media platforms. Last month, Ofcom’s Media Nations: Scotland report revealed that four in five regular viewers in Scotland rated BBC One’s wide range of quality news highly (78 per cent), above the UK average and above the ratings recorded by audiences in England and Wales. And the early evening edition of Reporting Scotland remains the most watched television news programme in Scotland.So let us allow the evidence, gathered by external, reputable media analysts to provide proper balance in the arguments around the BBC.And that evidence very clearly tells us that audiences value the BBC. They value it as a trusted and authoritative voice, one which is not influenced by political or commercial pressures or by arguments from one side or another of a debate. They value it for being a news provider that will get to the heart of a story to better help audiences understand the forces that shape all of our lives and, in turn, to help us all to make informed decisions about our futures.Does the BBC get it right every time? Of course not. We make mistakes and we occasionally get things wrong, just as everyone does. In her article, Lesley tells us that we have “infuriated not just Yes voters” by failing to report on recent “local pro indy marches across Scotland”. It took BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley to point out to her, on Twitter, that she was wrong – we had reported on them, extensively, and often in stories leading our bulletins on TV, on radio and online (though Lesley’s counter argument to Nick, on Twitter, that “website reports are not broadcasting” does seem at odds with the digital world in which we all live).Nick’s intervention also confounds Lesley’s assertion that BBC journalists are “forbidden from correcting even factual errors for fear of escalating Twitter wars”. If that’s true, someone better alert Nick, Gary Robertson, Douglas Fraser and host of other BBC Scotland journalists who haven’t been afraid to put the record straight where required.            Because our journalists do as they should and ask hard questions of those in power doesn’t reflect a bias against a government or a party in power. It doesn’t mean we favour one side of an argument over another. And it doesn’t mean we shape our news agendas to tell bad news stories rather than tell the truth, as some believe. It means our journalists are doing their job, properly scrutinising the decisions and proclamations of those in power.The issue over BBC content being posted online brought a further consequence, with over 200 people turning up at Pacific Quay in Glasgow last weekend to demonstrate against BBC bias. We offered to talk. That offer still stands. We want to engage, constructively, in dialogue with those who question our journalism or are suspicious of our decision-making. Next year, the introduction of a new BBC TV channel for Scotland, and a new hour-long weeknight news programme, will offer us a significant opportunity to engage further with audiences, to offer more space for dialogue and discussion about the issues that matter. It is important that we all engage and grasp that opportunity, in the same way that it is important that we grasp the opportunity to sit down and talk. We might not, in the end, all agree, but at least we will be better placed to understand each other.Ian Small is the head of public policy and corporate affairs at BBC Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

New figures have prompted fresh calls for control over energy to be devolved to Holyrood and a cut to renewable subsidies.            Scotland was the fourth largest consumer of green energy in the EU in 2016, with 54 per cent of its electricity provided by renewables, according to statistics compiled by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe). This is more than twice as much as the average for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.            More than two thirds of Scotland’s electricity came from renewables in 2017 – a 15 per cent rise in one year and a threefold increase since 2007.Nationalist MSP Alasdair Allan said: “With over half of our energy supplied by renewable sources, Scotland is, alongside Austria, Sweden and Portugal, crowding out fossil fuels faster than most other EU nations. We are setting an example to the rest of the UK as one of Europe’s top consumers and producers of renewable energy.“The Tories need to take a more strategic view of our environment and stop cutting subsidies for renewables, which experts have confirmed will be more cost-effective than nuclear power in the near future.”Scotland’s green record beats other EU nations like Germany, which has seen a rapid expansion of renewables with its groundbreaking Energy Act of 2000 and plans to phase out nuclear power stations by 2022. Denmark is also behind Scotland despite being a recognised world leader in decarbonisation in recent decades, developing new offshore wind farms.The UK government’s green energy priorities came under fire two years ago when the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was axed and policies came under the business agenda.             Gina Hanrahan, of WWF Scotland, said: “If the sector is to continue to grow, the UK government must urgently provide a route to market for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and support for newer technologies like tidal power.”A Government spokesperson said: “The UK is world leading in tackling climate change, with carbon emissions 40 per cent lower since 1990 and over the last five years investment in renewables has more than doubled to an average of £9 billion each year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick.

As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nTuesday 21 Aug 2018 6:41 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27431  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nIrish Unity makes sense.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

And this has been going on at this address for over 60 years. It’s the boys at the minute but previous to that it was their daddy and before that their grandfather Ernie. We were the first house on the road and then a lot of other houses came up around us.”\n\nMrs Sterritt added: “I feel it would be impossible to work around those timings.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOne neighbour who spoke to the Ulster Gazette was quoted in the local paper as saying the boys’ drums are “never played for a duration or at a time which could be considered anti-social”.\n\nThe council letter warns of a fine of up to £5,000 if the order is breached.\n\nA spokesperson for the council said: “The council can confirm an Abatement Notice in respect of a Statutory Noise Nuisance has been served and is part of an ongoing investigation. \n\n“Councils have a statutory duty to investigate noise complaints and if a nuisance is established the council is obliged to serve an abatement notice.

day.\n  \nAlison Moore, Ballymena BID Manager said: “We are very excited to bring the Summer Carnival back to Ballymena town centre for a second year.\n  \n “The event was extremely well received last year and enjoyed by those who attended so we’re determined to make sure this year is bigger and better.\n  \n“We love having the opportunity to entertain visitors and the Summer Carnival creates a fantastic atmosphere within the town.”\n  \nAlison continued, “Our local retailers and businesses helped to make the Summer Carnival the success it was last year by getting involved either by holding their own promotions and special offers, as well as setting up stalls outside their stores. \n  \n“Many businesses also donated prizes for the Roadshow Giveaway with Cool FM and we have some excellent prizes up for grabs this year too!”\n  \nThe Cool FM Roadshow with presenter Pete Snodden will be live from the Harmony Hub from 1.30pm to 3.30pm.\n  \nAlison concluded, “Ballymena is the town that has something for everyone and we have no doubt the Summer Carnival will be an upbeat way to celebrate the end of the summer season. \n  \n“There will also be lots of live music around the town which we hope everyone will enjoy. \n  \n“We are really looking forward to the return of our summer carnival and hope you and your family will come along and enjoy what is going to be a fantastic day.”\n

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost.

His children have fond memories of helping to serve dinner, pulling crackers and entertaining everyone. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs the Health Service progressed into more modern times, Craigavon Area Hospital was built. Matt helped to design and set up an ultra modern x-ray department and moved in as the only consultant radiologist, where he remained until his retirement. \n\nSome of Matt’s many hobbies in his younger days included golf, fishing, rugby, horse-riding and in particular, dancing. \n\nOne memorable occasion was recalled when he sneaked out of the house, against his parents’ wishes, cycled from Bushmills to the Arcadia Ballroom, Portrush for a night’s dancing. He was only caught out when his photograph appeared on the front page of the local newspaper, having won a dancing competition.\n\nIn later life, Matt’s hobbies became more expensive as his passion for classic and vintage cars grew. He spent many hours on cold winter nights in his garage with friends, building his classic collection.\n\nAs a member of Banbridge Vintage Car Club, he was also involved in the organisation of the annual car show at the Slieve Donard Hotel, Newcastle, to raise funds for Cancer Research. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs patriarch of the family, Matt was always ready to give guidance. He was frequently called upon for medical advice and it was recalled how on one occasion when asked to check if his granddaughter’s arm was broken, he offered her a favourite chocolate bar. When she immediately reached to grasp it he knew no further treatment was needed. \n\nMatt enjoyed nothing more than a good get-together, as was evident from the huge party held on his and Lorna’s 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nHe was an optimist always looking on the bright side of life. No matter what trials he had to endure his usual response was, ‘it’s only another chapter in my life.’ Matt was a true family man and due to his passionate nature always enjoyed a good debate. \n\nHe was a humble man, never introducing himself as Dr McCurdy - always just Matt. \n\nHe inspired those around him, laughed and lived every day to the full. \n\nMatthew was the devoted husband of Lorna, loving dad to Helen, David and Patricia and their spouses, Andres, Anee and Karl and proud grandfather to Gemma, Alexandra, Victoria, Olivia, Alexander and Thomas. \n\nWilliam Bell and Co had charge of the funeral and donations in lieu of flowers can be sent to them at 23 Kenlis Street, Banbridge, BT32 3LR for Chest Heart and Stroke and Cancer Research NI.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8600712.1534255814!/image/image.jpg","title":"local duo go state side to study business","story":"\nDROMORE student Jack Rice is jetting off to study business in the USA this month.\n\n                \nJack, who is currently studying Accounting at Queen’s University Belfast, will spend the next academic year at Dakota Wesleyan University, South Dakota, after being selected to take part in British Council’s prestigious Study USA programme.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe 21 year-old will join 53 other students including Amy Gray from Banbridge on the programme, which enables students to study business and management for a year in American colleges, across 34 States, where they gain valuable international experience and business knowledge, helping to develop their career prospects when they return to Northern Ireland.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAbout the experience he said: “I don’t think I’ve ever been as excited for something in my life.

A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry girls group launches campaign against hard border","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Fortunately Holly has been successful in her place for university, however the grade that she was expecting was an A and she only got a B, and that was given out based on the coursework she did earlier in the year, the course was supposed to be 50% coursework 50% exam.\n\n\"We were absolutely horrified and there was no letter of explanation from the school to us that morning, not even to say what they were going to do or what they had done for us.\n\nShe said that she had been unsuccessful in her attempts to get an explanation from WJEC.\n\n\"It was left up to us as parents to try to find out exactly what was going on and what we could do to try and get some help,\" Mrs McCartney said.\n\n\"I found out that morning she had sat that examination under the Welsh board and I contacted them and only got voicemails and I never got speaking to anybody.\n\n\"We got a letter from school on Saturday morning, a little too late, it should have been sent out when they were aware the exam papers had gone missing on.\"\n\nMrs McCartney said that although her daughter was lucky other pupils may have missed out on university places due to the mixup.\n\n\"It has been a reasonable enough outcome but I am sure there are other kids in her class who may have been turned down by their first choice,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A teacher told us the papers were sent off by first class post, this was to specifications set out by Welsh examination board. There was no tracking for this so the Welsh board have told them they have never received these which I just think is outrageous.\"\n\nDr Carruthers said that the school was doing everything they could to resolve the matter.\n\n\"The school regrets that this has happened at what is a stressful time for pupils and parents.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

For items less than £100, you may be able to use your debit or credit card provider\u0027s Chargeback scheme,\" he said.\n\nThe comments came as it was revealed House of Fraser owed more than £484m to creditors including top designer brands Armani, Diesel, Prada and Gucci. \n\nAnd Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley, who bought out House of Fraser, will not be footing the bill for any money owed before his £90m rescue last Friday.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article35608522.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/AFP_NE1BF.jpg","title":"methodist minister and peacemaker rev harold good calls for dup and sinn fein leaders to come together to restore powersharing","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He has also worked on peace processes in Spain and Colombia.\n\n\nIn an open letter\n addressed to the leadership of both the DUP and Sinn Fein, published by journalist Eamonn Mallie on his website, Rev Good appealed for Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill to “come together and do whatever it takes” to restore the Assembly.\n\nHe said that he had been moved to write to the party leaders after the ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bombing, saying he was inspired by the “courage” shown by the families of the 29 victims who died in the Real IRA bombing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRev Harold Good addresses a rally to celebrate the announcement of disarmament by Eta in Bayonne on Saturday\n\n\n\n\nHe said: “Personal stories of ‘moving on’ contrast so sharply with the murderous intent of those who planted the bomb and of the political intransigence which prevents us from leaving our dark past where it belongs and moving forward together.\n\n“I suggest that passive admiration of the spirit of others is not enough, however sincere. You will know that I am not alone in asking – if the stories and voices of the victims of Omagh are not enough, what will it take to lift us out of the sodden trenches of our political impasse?\n\n“Surely we owe it to these yet quietly grieving people of incredible courage – and to those for whom they grieve – to come together and do whatever it will take to restore OUR Assembly and our confidence in normal effective governance?”\n\nRev Good, who is a former Methodist president and was awarded the World Methodist Peace Prize, said he feared that people in Northern Ireland \"are learning to live with political inactivity\" and that many did not realise the \"very serious short and long-term consequences\" if the Assembly is not restored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArlene Foster and Michelle O\u0027Neill\n\n\n\n\nHe added: \"I plead with you once more, listen not to predictable and tired old voices like mine, but to those from Omagh and to so many others from across our community who, out of their unspeakable suffering, have shown us in their own incontrovertible way how to face the challenges of the present and the future with dispassionate courage.\n\n\"I will continue to watch this space with ongoing and deep concern, yet refusing to give up on my hopes of what you and all of our political leaders can yet deliver.\"\n\n\"I trust you have the will to undertake the necessary courageous journey as have the people of Omagh to whom I have already referred, along with so many others who share both my frustration as well as my great expectations.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland has worst level of access to fast broadband in the uk","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We are reaching thousands more homes and businesses every week, that can now reap the clear and tangible benefits that superfast broadband provides.\n\n\"We are helping to ensure the downfall of the digital divide.\"\n\nMs James said the target was to ensure everyone in the UK has access to fast and affordable broadband by 2020 and there should be nationwide gigabit connectivity by 2033.\n\nClive Selly, chief executive of Openreach, part of BT, said the superfast broadband rollout was one of the country\u0027s great engineering achievements.\n\n\"It is great to see businesses across the UK reaping the benefits of faster broadband speeds,\" he said.\n\n\"We\u0027ve also recently introduced a raft of lower wholesale prices to help drive higher take-up of faster fibre services which will help to further fuel the boost to the UK economy.\"\n\nThe Evaluation of the Economic Impact and Public Value of the Superfast Broadband Programme report said for every £1 invested in superfast broadband, business had seen a £12.28 benefit.\n\nEarlier this year, a report by telecommunications regulator Ofcom found 50,500 premises in Northern Ireland - around 7.5% of the total - are unable to access sufficient broadband service in Northern Ireland. \n\nDecent broadband speed across the UK is set at a download speed of at least 10Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 1Mbit/s.\n\nThe worst-affected council area of Northern Ireland was Fermanagh and Omagh.\n\nSome 21% of households are still unable to access decent broadband, while some 12% of households in Mid-Ulster affected.\n\nHouseholds in Belfast saw the highest rates of access.\n\nAlthough placed at the bottom of the UK\u0027s regions, Northern Ireland is set for a £150m boost to its broadband network.\n\nThat money was secured as part of the DUP\u0027s confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservative government.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new steam treatment could offer hope to men with enlarged prostates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

men who suffer from the common condition of an enlarged prostate could soon be spared surgery thanks to a new steam treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe procedure, which can be done as a day-case under local anaesthetic or sedation, involves injecting small amounts of steam into the prostate.\n\nIt is expected to be given the green light for routine NHS use on Wednesday by health watchdog Nice (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).\n\nOne in three men over the age of 50 suffer from symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which can include needing to visit the toilet more frequently and with more urgency and experiencing difficulty emptying their bladder.\n\nMany men will undergo an operation to relieve the condition, called a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), but this can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, incontinence and sexual dysfunction.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe steam treatment, called Rezum, avoids the need for invasive surgery and is said to carry fewer side effects.\n\nWater vapour at a temperature of about 103C is injected into the prostate for between eight and 10 seconds, with the heat destroying some of the prostate tissue and reducing its size.\n\nProfessor Hashim Ahmed, chair in Urology at Imperial College London and a consultant at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, began trialling the treatment last year.\n\nSpeaking at the time, he said: “This treatment will not only be a better alternative for men facing a longer procedure with added recovery time but we can also offer it to those who are on life-long medication who opted not to have surgery because they were worried about side effects of traditional surgery.”\n\nA consultation document on the procedure published by Nice earlier this year made draft recommendations that stated current evidence was “adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit”.\n\nThe final guidance will be published on Wednesday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"7 times this sassy twitter account used humour for a serious road","story":"\n

The centre-left opposition Labour Party elected one leader, Keven Rudd, twice during a chaotic six years in power.\n\n“There is a high transaction cost from changing leaders. Labour’s seen that, we’ve seen that,” Mr Frydenberg told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\n“I believe that Malcolm Turnbull is the right person to lead us to the next election.”\n\nMr Turnbull made a major concession to his opponents within his party on Monday by abandoning plans to legislate to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe concession avoided the most conservative government politicians voting against the legislation in Parliament, openly undermining his authority.\n\nBut former prime minister Tony Abbott, who was replaced by Mr Turnbull in a ballot of government politicians in 2015, was not convinced that Mr Turnbull had given up on reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 26% below 2005 levels through legislation.\n\n“What we want to know is: Where are this prime minister’s convictions?” Mr Abbott told the ABC outside Parliament House on Monday night.\n\n“It was a conversion of convenience this morning,” Mr Abbott added.\n\n\n\nI believe that Malcolm Turnbull is the right person to lead us to the next election\nEnvironment Minister Josh Frydenberg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nDamian Drum, a politician in The Nationals’ party, a junior coalition partner, called on Mr Abbott to resign from Parliament instead of destabilising the government.\n\n“He vowed that he wouldn’t be a wrecker,” Mr Drum told reporters of Mr Abbott.\n\n“That’s exactly what he’s been — a wrecker, and he needs to get out of the joint.”\n\nMr Frydenbeg said Cabinet ministers on Monday night expressed their support for Mr Turnbull, including Mr Dutton, who was a staunch ally of Mr Abbott.\n\nDeputy Liberal Party leader Julie Bishop retained her position unopposed at Tuesday’s ballot.\n\nAustralia has gone through an extraordinary period of political instability since prime minister John Howard lost power in 2007 after more than 11 years in office.\n\nMr Turnbull would next month become Australia’s longest serving prime minister since Mr Howard, having held the office for three years and four days.\n\nThe government has trailed Labour in most opinion polls since the last election in 2016. Australians are due to hold a general election early next year.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"jennifer lopez kylie jenner and ariana grande wow on vmas red carpet","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

the progress on the proposal.\n\n“It’s good to see these plans progress, as this building has been closed for some time now, and it will be a positive move for the local community to see it brought back into use,” Cllr Tierney said.\n\n“The new centre will also benefit the young people living in the Galliagh area, and also help to bring new investment in youth services and schemes for young people.”\n\nThe plans will be considered by the local council’s Planning Committee in the autumn.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein derry call meenan square site bosgide cleaned secured soon
