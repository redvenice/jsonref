Craig Erlam, analyst at OANDA, says oil prices are unsurprisingly taking another hit as risk sentiment turns negative once again. The lira weakened, again, after Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, pledged he would never defend interest rate hikes nor compromise on the issue, after recent rate cuts hammered the lira. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, warns that the risk of hyperinflation is growing. If so, that would weaken the economy’s recovery from its historic pandemic hit.  It could also slow the rebalancing from goods spending back to services, which was expected to slow inflation. Mann told a question-and-answer event hosted by Barclays.  Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, is testifying to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee at 3pm UK time (10am New York). His prepared testimony was released last night, and shows that he will cite the pick-up in infections, and the latest Covid-19 variant, as risks. Powell, who was nominated for a second term as Fed chief last week, will say: Powell will also tell senators that the US economy has continued to strengthen, but the rise in Delta variant cases temporarily slowed progress over the summer. He will say: GSK has hired one of the scientists behind Pfizer’s mRNA Covid-19 shot, Phil Dormitzer, as its global head of R\u0026ampD for vaccines. Dormitzer will join GSK on December 3rd, in a move that bolsters the British pharmaceuticals firm’s vaccine operations.  Dormitzer was Pfizer’s Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, RNA and Viral Vaccines.  In that role, he provided “Pfizer scientific leadership for the development of Comirnaty, the RNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine”, says GSK.  The company has lagged behind rivals in the race to develop a Covid-19 shot, and been under pressure to develop a portfolio of new medicines, so poaching Dormitzer from Pfizer could strengthen its efforts. Hal Barron, GSK chief scientific officer and R\u0026ampD president, says: Travel, hospitality, property and oil companies are still lower today. Walid Koudmani, market analyst at financial brokerage XTB, says the mood in the markets has worsened after Monday’s minor recovery. India’s Business Today reports that robust manufacturing and services sector demand and record vaccination coverage helped the economy keep growing (India administered its billionth Covid jab in October). The University of Oxford said that there was limited data on Omicron so far, and that it would carefully evaluate the impact of the variant on its shot, echoing an AstraZeneca statement last week. UK hospitality companies are worried that omicron could mean a repeat of last winter, when soaring Covid-19 cases and newly identified variant led to a lost Christmas.  The Parkers Arms in rural Lancashire is freezing cold and cannot take bookings over the phone, at least for now. Four days ago, Storm Arwen took out the power lines and telephone wires linking this rural Lancashire gastropub to the outside world. Its ever-optimistic proprietor, Stosie Madi, expects normal service to resume by the weekend at the pub in Newton-in-Bowland. But now – like the rest of the hospitality sector – she has a new worry on her mind: the Omicron variant of Covid-19. “We’re fully booked for the Christmas season and we’re quite pleased with that but we’ve had some cancellations come through,” she says, adding that the bulk came on Sunday after Boris Johnson announced tighter rules in response to the variant. She worries fresh Covid-19 pessimism risks dampening trade, which had been booming since restrictions were lifted in the summer. “People have been making up for lost time but the worst thing that could happen is if we’re stopped from trading,” Madi says.  Stéphane Bancel said while it would take two weeks to get data on how the existing vaccines perform against the new Covid variant – and whether it causes severe disease – it would take several months to tweak the current vaccines to tackle Omicron. Bancel told the Financial Times. He suggested that pharma companies would struggle between targeting Omicron and the existing Covid variants, warning it would be risky to shift Moderna’s entire production capacity to an Omicron-specific jab. In the meantime, Bancel suggested there might be a case for giving more potent boosters to the elderly or people with compromised immune systems. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said on Friday that they could produce and ship an updated version of their vaccine within 100 days if the new Covid variant detected in southern Africa was found to evade existing immunity. Bancel said the high number of Omicron mutations on the spike protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and the rapid spread of the variant in South Africa suggested existing vaccines would not be very effective, predicting a “material drop” in the effectiveness. Here’s the full story: New York traders, like those in Europe and Asia-Pacific markets, will be concerned by the Moderna CEO’s prediction that existing vaccines will struggle with Omicron. The Dow tumbled 900+ points on Friday, when omicron fears first hit the markets, before a modest (236-point) recovery yesterday. Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, says virus worries are keeping markets on edge:  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea060ddbd6413d2964e912ae6f1a921ed0c0a1e9/0_0_2750_1650/master/2750.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a9e613aaf1fc3cc02e1692f077b7ccde","title":"world chess championship live magnus carlsen ian nepomniachtchi","story":"Fabiano Caruana, who played the Petroff in the sixth and 11th games of his world championship match with Carlsen three years ago, has been speaking extensively about the opening on Chess’s broadcast. “I thought that the most logical thing for Ian would be to play the Berlin,” Caruana says. “That seemed like a natural choice for him in case Magnus were to play 1. e4. But the Petroff is interesting. I really did not expect this.”Will today be the day? Interestingly, Carlsen has not held the lead in the classical stage of a world championship match in more than seven years, since he first defended the title in a 2014 rematch with Vishy Anand. In 2016, he fell behind Sergey Karjakin with a Game 8 defeat before prevailing in Game 10 to force a series of quickfire tie-breakers, which he went on to win. In 2018, he played to 12 consecutive draws with second-ranked Fabiano Caruana before retaining the title on tie-breakers once again.For those of you just coming aboard, Carlsen, who celebrates his 31st birthday today, has been at No 1 in the Fide rankings for 10 straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he dethroned Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Nepomniachtchi, also 31, is ranked No 5, having earned his place at the table by winning the eight-man candidates tournament in April with a round to spare. It’s the culmination of a rivalry that started nearly two decades ago when they first met across the board as boys at the 2002 European Under-12 Championship in Peniscola, Spain. Notably, Nepomniachtchi enters the title tilt with a winning lifetime record against Carlsen in classical matches (four won, one lost and eight drawn). That makes him unique among today’s top players, even if two of those victories came in youth championships. We’re a little more than 40 minutes from today’s first move, so not much longer now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07472575e31983ef8668625a17b6db25c41fe8dc/23_0_3498_2100/master/3498.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=32580aa7e8d99176d8586a4182e06ab1","title":"us congress government shutdown washington us politics live","story":"And then we have the small matter of the debt limit, the arbitrary borrowing cap that is raised each year to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts – a move that would cause economic catastrophe. The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said the US can meet its obligations till 15 December or so. A stopgap funding bill to extend government funding through mid- to late January is set to be introduced in the House of Representatives today. Republicans have indicated that we should not expect a government shutdown for the holiday season, and that we could instead witness the gift of bipartisan cooperation. With the debt limit, however? Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer informed his leadership team that he and minority leader Mitch McConnell were still in talks.  Punchbowl News, a Capitol Hill-focused outlet, isn’t expecting the same high drama over the debt ceiling as back in October. In their morning newsletter, their reporters noted that McConnell’s remarks to them of “we’re still talking about it” contained “no saber rattling, no threats – nothing”. They called it “a pretty significant departure” from his “more hardline rhetoric”, believing it may signal “a very serious effort to come to an agreement and avoid a debt-limit standoff”."},{"url":null,"title":"i want to be a vet but i ll never get 600 cao points are there other options","story":"There is strong demand for veterinary graduates of recognised programmes in the UK and EU. Photograph: Getty ImagesI really want to become a vet. I’m studying biology and chemistry, as advised by my guidance counsellor, and volunteer locally with my local vet and pet rescue centre. However, there’s no chance I’ll score in the 600-point range to secure a place on the UCD course. Are there any other options? If your heart is set on becoming a veterinary surgeon, don’t lose hope. There are numerous routes available.Yes, securing one of the 82 places on offer in the only course in Ireland at UCD is very challenging given CAO entry points this year reached 601. Even without grade inflation, points were still high in 2019 (567 points) and under the calculated grades process in 2020 ( 587 points).Points look set to drop back somewhat in 2022, returning to a more normal results pattern arising from the traditional exams, but not I suspect to 2019 levels. This is because there will be over 10,000 applicants in this year’s CAO competition holding inflated points which they secured in 2020 and 2021.Alongside CAO points applicants must acquire at least 15 hours of practical animal handling experience between 1st February 2019 and 7th July 2022. (For full details and to complete your records of experience please visit: www.ucd.ieregistryadmissionsvet ).So, what alternatives are there? You could consider an application to one of the UK colleges through Ucas . Some new vet programmes have been added in recent years in Surrey, Nottingham, Aberystwyth in Wales, alongside the long-standing programmes. UK colleges tend to look for a H1 in both chemistry and biology and in either physics or higher level maths. Tuition fees are stg£9,250 per year.Another option is applying to programmes offered in Eastern European universities. Dr Tim O’ Leary, (timolearyvet@gmail) a veterinary surgeon in Schull in West Cork, has been for many years coordinating the application process for Irish students seeking places in the veterinary college in Budapest.He recently told me that, notwithstanding the excellent work of UCD in educating the next generation of Irish vets, there is still a strong demand at equine, farm and small animal practice levels for graduates of other EU programmes.Entry requirements for Budapest are based on a short exam in May in biology and chemistry in Dublin, and a brief interview to determine suitability.Guy Flouch, founder Eunicas.ie, has also facilitated Irish students in securing places in veterinary programmes in a number of Polish universities including Warsaw, as well as in the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria.Fees for all these Eastern European programmes can vary from €8,000-€12,000, depending on location. While it is expensive, accommodation in Warsaw or Budapest for shared apartments can be had for as little as €150-200 per month.My advice? Focus on your studies and see what your Leaving Cert produces next August. But as a form of insurance, consider applying to veterinary programmes abroad.Do you have an education query?

No self-adminisitered tests will be accepted, under rules considered by cabinet. Those with a PCR test result will have a longer pre-travel window of 72 hours.Persons arriving into the State from overseas who have been vaccinated or recovered from Covid19 will be required also to have a certified negative test.The Cabinet on Tuesday also endorsed National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) recommendations that children aged nine and over wear masks in school and reduce indoor socialising.The Government did not make wearing masks for children a legal requirements, instead leaving them as recommendation to schools and parents, while asking them to curtail their children’s contacts. In general, the advice for children will be the same as for adults to reduce socialising.Earlier, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly expressed relief at the latest Nphet figures which indicate that the efforts of the public have made a difference.Sobering modellingThe latest Nphet figures showed what the situation was now compared with the “sobering modelling forecasts” of two weeks ago, he said. “I’m delighted to be able to say that we can really see the impact of the efforts that people are making.”The Minister also said he hoped that following this morning’s meeting there would be “very clear guidance” on mask wearing in schools and that there would be “very clear advice” for parents.The analysis from Nphet showed that case numbers were particularly high in nine, 10 and 11 year olds, he said. This was the reason for the recommendation for children to wear masks in primary schools from third class up, he explained.Nphet reported yesterday that there were 4,607 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 579 hospitalised, of which 115 are in ICU.The Government will introduce two pieces of emergency legislation to the Oireachtas this week to deal with the latest surge in Covid-19 with case numbers and hospitalisations remaining high. A Bill to reintroduce mandatory hotel quarantine will be brought to the Dáil on Thursday. The Government has told Opposition parties it expects the Bill to pass all stages and has also said the debate will be subject to quarantine. On Friday, the Health and Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill will come before the Dáil. This Bill will extend the Covid emergency powers where the Minister for Health is allowed to make regulations without recourse to parliament. Most opposition parties will not oppose this Bill but will seek amendments. However, Sinn Féin on Tuesday said it would oppose the Bill, as it has opposed earlier extensions. “We have reservations about that Bill particularly in relation to the competence of Minister (for Health) Stephen Donnelly,” said the party’s health spokesman David Cullinane. “We are not in the mood to give this Minister for Health any blank cheques in relation to introduce ing regulations where there is no accountability or oversight or debate.”Hotel quarantineHe accused Mr Donnelly of making “a dog’s dinner” out of many (regulations). The reintroduction of mandatory hotel quarantine has been on the Government’s agenda since the identification of a new highly transmissible variant of Covid-19 in South Africa last week. The legislation is in specific response to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Speaking at Leinster House on Tuesday, Mr Cullinane said his party would nevertheless support the advice from Government for children, saying he agreed it should be advisory not mandatory. “It’s a sensible approach as long as the appropriate supports are put in place for business who will face consequences,” he said. “My view is that most of the people have abided by most of the advice most of the tie and that has put us in a strong position.”However, in separate media interviews, Mr Cullinane and Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall both condemned what they described as Mr Donnelly’s ‘U-turn’ on free or subsidised antigen tests. Calling for free antigen tests, Mr Cullinane said: “It might be okay for some of us on decent salaries. If there is a family with five or six nd they all have to take three antigen tests over a five-day period.”Asked what controls could be put in place to ensure that the cost to the State of free antigen tests did not spiral out of control as they did in Britain, Mr Cullinane said the infrastructure and ability was there to ensure that. He also aid people should be trusted to do what is right. Ms Shortall said the decision not to subsidise antigen tests was a “big mistake and does not make sense on any fronts”. SubsidiseShe said the Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Mr Donnelly had promised to subsidise antigens tests.“The Government should not be leaving this important tool to the vagaries of the market. It’s important that the Government ensures certainty of supply and (that) the quality is good.”“A family of four using it twice a week. That amounts to €30 a week which is a sizable amount of money.”On the Janssen single-shot vaccine which was given to many people aged between 18 and 24 last summer, she said it was now known it waned very quickly and its efficacy was down to 13 per cent after nine months. “For that reason priority needs to be given to that cohort between 18 and 34 who got the Janssen vaccine and are in the main out socialising and mixing most as young people do.”She said there was no doubt that children are paying a big price at the moment and criticised inconsistencies in the rules. “On the one hand you have rugby matches with 50,000 people and at the same time you are saying to children, you can’t go on a playdate. There is an imbalance there.”Speaking on his way into Cabinet, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said that parents will make the “judgement calls” on reducing socialisation for their children. He said: “It’s not a strict no on any one thing. It’s just saying do what we’re doing well.”In remarks reported by RTÉ he said that Covid numbers are leveling and the advice for children will be “the same as adults, restrict socialisation”.He said parents will be the judge on that and how to protect their family’s health.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"balance in keeping schools open and social activity must be found ombudsman","story":"Cabinet is set to endorse recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team for children to reduce indoor socialisation and for those aged nine and over to wear masks in school.

Video: ReutersEU commissioner for health Stella Kyriakides: ‘Certain member states lag behind considerably in terms of this crucial dimension.’ Photograph: Julien WarnandPoolEPAThe European Union’s health commissioner has urged governments to boost efforts to detect coronavirus mutations, as data shows Ireland is one of seven EU member states that did not carry out sufficient levels of genome sequencing of Covid-19 cases in the first half of November.In a letter to health ministers across the EU, Stella Kyriakides said “certain member states lag behind considerably” in genome sequencing, which analyses cases of the virus and compares them with other cases to identify any changes.Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) showed that, in the first half of November, Ireland, Finland, Greece, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Cyprus and Lithuania lagged behind what Ms Kyriakides describes as a “crucial dimension” of slowing the spread of Covid-19.The variant first found in southern Africa has now been identified in several European countries, but it is hard to track its spread as various countries do not carry out sufficient genome sequencing of positive samples.In her letter, Ms Kyriakides urged all member states to do more.Genomic sequencing decodes genes in the Sars-CoV-2 genome to tell scientists which variant might be present, allowing them to monitor mutations and learn more about the virus.VaccinesMs Kyriakides also urged ministers to vaccinate faster and offer boosters urgently.“Already faced with a challenging winter due to the high transmissibility of the Delta variant . . . we may now experience further or additional pressures because of the appearance of the Omicron variant,” she wrote.Earlier on Tuesday, the chief executive of vaccine-maker Moderna warned that the plethora of mutations in the Omicron variant would likely help it evade protection provided by existing vaccines, making it necessary to develop new immunisations.Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times it may take months for pharmaceutical companies to develop and deploy updated immunisations that they can deliver in large numbers.The current vaccines from companies including Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson are all able to help reduce the risk of severe infection and death from the previous strains of the virus, though they work less well against the more transmissible Delta variant.Research is still under way to determine if Omicron causes the same level of illness as older versions of the virus, if it can evade protection from vaccines and previous infections, and if it will be able to outcompete the existing strains as the pathogen continues to circulate throughout the world.Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said his company will be ready with a vaccine targeting Omicron in 100 days, should it be necessary.International pictureJapan confirmed its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant on Tuesday after a test on a visitor who recently arrived from Namibia in southern Africa.Chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the man in his 30s tested positive on arrival at an airport on Sunday, was isolated and is being treated in hospital. A genome analysis confirmed that he was infected with the new variant.Japan announced on Monday that it will ban all foreign visitors from Tuesday as an emergency precaution against the variant.The World Health Organisation warned on Monday that the global risk from the Omicron variant is “very high” based on early evidence, saying it could lead to surges with “severe consequences”.In Australia, the New South Wales (NSW) government introduced new testing measures and increased fines for returned travellers who breach new Omicron isolation rules, hours after the country’s prime minister Scott Morrison urged premiers to “not get spooked” by the new variant.On Tuesday evening, as NSW Health confirmed the Omicron strain had been detected in a fifth returned traveller in the state, premier Dominic Perrottet announced fines for breaching the 72-hour home-isolation requirement, introduced in response to the variant, would rise to 5,000 AUD, up from 1,000 AUD.Additionally, all returned travellers – who are already required to get a negative PCR test in order to finish their three-day home quarantine – will now also be required to get an additional PCR test six days after arriving in the state and three days after finishing their isolation.President of the United States Joe Biden has cautioned Americans against panicking, urging them to instead get vaccinated or have an extra shot.“This variant is a cause for concern. Not a cause for panic,” Mr Biden said in remarks at the White House after a private briefing from his health advisers. He said the administration doesn’t yet believe new formulations of coronavirus vaccines will be necessary but that it is already working with Pfizer and Moderna on contingency plans.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded its recommendation for booster vaccines to all adults as cases top 262 million and deaths pass 5.2 million. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"government agrees to 2 2bn mica redress scheme","story":"Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is expected to hold a press conference at lunchtime on Tuesday formally announcing the scheme. Photograph: Alan Betson The Government has agreed to finance a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild and remediate an estimated 7,500 homes which have been structurally damaged by Mica. The Cabinet agreed to a scheme where 100 per cent redress will be available to affected homes up to a limit of €420,000 per home. Crucially, the per-square-foot allowable cost has also been increased upwards in the past 24 hours from €138 top €145 for the first 1,000 square feet, with a commitment from the Government that the scheme will take inflation into account, and the per-foot cost will be reviewed every year. That issue in particular had proved to be contentious with campaign groups saying the €138 per square foot figure was inadequate in the light of sharp inflation in the construction industry over the past year. It is estimated that 7,500 homes in Donegal and Mayo have been damaged by the presence of Mica in blocks used for their construction. However, there are households in other counties - including Clare and Tipperary - who have also been affected, but not all of whom have come forward yet. At a press conference following the Cabinet meeting, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien outlined details of the scheme. He said the overall cost of the scheme had been almost tripled from over €800,000 to €2.2 billion with the maximum allowable amount increased from €247,000 to €420,000. He also said that homeowners who had to move out of their homes during renovation would be entitled to a maximum of €15,000 to pay for alternative accommodation as well as €5,000 for storage. He said that a new independent appeals process will be introduced and that second homes or rented homes would be eligible once they were registered with the Rent Tenancy Board. He said that primary legislation would be required to introduce the scheme and that a review would also be taken by a senior counsel into the role of industry and regulation in contributing to the crisis. A review will also take place into latent defects insurance as well as a process to ensure that concrete blocks standards were of the highest level. “Our commitment is to establish a building standards regulatory authority on a statutory basis,” added Mr O’Brien. The Minister said this scheme would ensure that homeowners affected by Mica would have parity with homeowners whose homes were damaged by Pyrite. “This issue has been raised regularly with me in relation to the east coast and the west coast,” he said. “This newly enhanced scheme ensures absolute parity of treatment for the north west coast and east coast and in some instances goes further.“Those impacted can rebuild their homes and more importantly they can rebuild their lives that have been so badly impacted,” he said. Mr O’Brien said that 7,500 homes were affected, 1,000 of which were social homes. He said it had taken nine years to remediate 2,600 homes affected by Pyrite. “The scale of this work should not be underestimated. There is a capacity issue as well,” he said.Asked about the view of three Government colleagues - Dara Calleary in Co Mayo, and Joe McHugh and Charlie McConalogue in Co Donegal - who have backed the campaign groups Mr O’Brien said he had many discussions with them, including late last night. “They recognised the significant changes that have been made,” he said. However, he said they themselves would respond to the scheme that has been offered.

However, health officials have stressed that they will still call people forward in age order, saying people should wait to be contacted.Until now, only those over the age of 40, and those in priority groups were eligible - and only if it was six months since their second jab. Details of the timetable for rollout are expected on Tuesday Nov 30.The new advice says boosters must be a minimum of three months after the second jab. But as the rollout will work down through age groups, most of those being offered boosters in the next few weeks are likely to have waited at least five months Once the NHS has invited you for your vaccine, you should be able to book a slot online at mass vaccination centres, hospitals, pharmacies and some GP practices. Health officials have yet to set out details of the new expanded programme, but say extra hospital sites will be opened, while some sites will be open for extended hoursThe vast majority of people will be offered Pfizer BionTech or Moderna. A small number of people who are unable to receive this type of jab will be offered AstraZeneca. As with the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, you won\u0027t be able choose which vaccine you will get so there\u0027s a chance you may receive a different brand of booster. A recent study by Oxford University found that mixing and matching vaccines can induce more immunity than having the same brand of jab.Booster doses have been found to provide 93 per cent protection against severe disease.At the moment, it isn’t known how well the jabs work against the new Omicron variant, and there may be a level of “mismatch” between vaccine and variant. However, scientists believe that the jabs are still likely to prevent severe disease. More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s private pilot to be questioned on day two of court caseCoronavirus latest news: Booster jabs will give \u0026#39lots of protection\u0026#39 against omicron, says Boris JohnsonDuke of York avoiding \u0026#39confronting his own misconduct\u0026#39 by blaming his victim, accuser’s lawyers claimIntroducing a \u0026#39woke code\u0026#39 for MPs would represent a flagrant rejection of political liberalismIS member convicted of genocide over systematic killing campaign against YazidisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"face masks became symbol divided britain","story":"Tis the season. Advent calendars waiting on mantelpieces. The jingle-jangle of sleigh bells on an endless muzak loop. A portly man promising a season of goodwill only for a grisly Covid variant to change everything and No 10’s advice to slip from ho-ho-ho to no-no-no. The crackdown’s first edict is already here. Today, like some unwelcome rehash of a movie you didn’t like the first time round, is Mask Day 2. At 4am today, the new regime dawned, replacing the do-as-you-see-fit attitude that followed “Freedom Day” on July 19 with an order to mask up in shops and on public transport. It had to be masks. There are a host of so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) able to dent Covid, from handwashing and work-from-home directives to full national lockdown. But, of all the options on the menu, none is so isive in Britain as the wearing of masks. None polarises us more, setting very British attitudes at odds with each other: the deferential queue observer against the authority questioner the selfless, polite personality against the robust, self-reliant inidual. It is as though our island’s character has been resolved into contradictions. Indeed on this issue the Union is indeed ided, with different rules in its four constituent parts. Today’s promise is that those who don’t comply will be walloped with a series of £200 fines, which double with each reoffence. But anyone who has seen “enforcement” on the London Underground – where staff themselves wear masks around their chins as canned messages demand passengers muffle up – will know this is likely to be a charade. Instead we must prepare ourselves for the return of that ultimate in British authority: the tutting and eye-rolling of social disapproval. What official force can compare? Other countries may endure anti-lockdown riots directed at the state, but Britain does it differently. From today, my friends, it is not us against them, but us against us as, with pursed lips or defiant stares, we once again begin to police ourselves.Who knows why this devolution of enforcement to the inidual is particular to Britain, but it is. Take a trip to France and you discover a host of measures that seem sensible there but unimaginable here. Want to get on the train? You need a mask and proof of vaccine. Two centuries of statist edicts from the centre make such rules unremarkable. And as for the draconian rules of Spain, or Greece, well it’s easy to forget that both were Right-wing military dictatorships within the last half century. Whereas we, in sometimes self-congratulating style, do cherish the whole Mother of Parliaments bit. And that Parliament is led by a man whose every fibre rebels against the nanny state, even if the pandemic might demand, from time to time, a dose of unpleasant nannying. From the very beginning, the experts at Sage’s behavioural insight subcommittee (Spi-B) were clear that, if the country was not to dissolve in bitter acrimony over masks, strong leadership would be required. “If government is to recommend that the public wear face masks in the community,” it noted on April 20 2020, a month into lockdown one, “there will need to be thorough guidance and communication.” Without it, we would have “heightened public awareness, negative evaluation and harassment of people who are not wearing face masks, leading to ision which could undermine collective solidarity which is helpful for managing the pandemic.”Instead of such clear guidance and communication, however, there was fudge. To begin with, that was not unusual. After all, at the beginning of the pandemic even the WHO considered there was insufficient evidence that masks reduced transmission. But that was when droplets from coughs and surface contact were considered the two main vectors, and the dangers of aerosols – particles hanging around in the air for ages – were largely unrecognised. On May 11 the first recommendations were made in England: the Government advised the use of a face coverings, but only in enclosed spaces, where social distancing was difficult. A month later, they became mandatory on public transport. A month after that, in shops, too. Such off-on requirements were off again this summer, but the ambiguity remained as official advice stated that “you are expected and recommended to continue wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces ... where the risk of transmission is likely to be greater.” Yet as we all know, Tory MPs on the Government benches have almost all abandoned masks, while Labour seem to have a three-line whip enforcing them. Professor Robert West, a psychologist on Spi-B, has warned how confusing this all can be. “People who are ambivalent, it gives them a kind of excuse to say, ‘If they’re not doing it why should I do it?’” The PM, however, prefers nudge to nanny-state. “Nudging” can be highly effective and has certainly informed the decision to market masks as a tool to protect others, as much as (if not more than) to protect oneself. Psychological studies suggest we like people more after doing something nice for them. Social cohesiveness is built on the giving and receiving of favours – like wearing a mask to protect them. As Spi-B noted as long ago as April 2020: “Wearing a face mask could demonstrate that an inidual is concerned for other people’s welfare and is enacting desired social norms around safety and hygiene.”Recently, though, the question has been: “What social norms?” In the early days, evidence of mask effectiveness was inconclusive but the goal to limit the spread of the virus was universal. Before vaccines or treatments we didn’t want to catch it and even thought we might be able to contain it.Now data on masks is much clearer. Observational studies report big reductions in infection (as high as 53 per cent). Two randomised trials, usually considered more reliable, report smaller, but still important, reductions of around 10 per cent. But stopping Covid’s spread is no longer so important to many people. Schools resemble chicken-pox parties, where parents drop off children to get them exposed to the virus, with the aim of better preparing them to fight infection later in life. Who now doesn’t expect to get Covid eventually?The answer, of course, is the elderly and vulnerable. But the fabric of social cohesion is fraying as more and more of us shrug and reconcile ourselves to the endemic nature of the disease. Liberty vs solidarity: the framing of today’s response is inherently political, Right vs Left. And nothing signals that better than a mask. As time has gone on, they have become ever-more like personal political broadcasts on behalf of the wearer. For the last few months, though, like manifestos out of campaign season, they have been largely uncontested. But today, once again, the national edict will freight them with moral significance. Prof David Halpern, chief executive of the Government’s Behavioural Insights Team, known as the Nudge Unit, who also sits on Sage, reckons that “the British are particularly good at this”.For the Government, such social policing has evident benefits: the brazen maskless commuter and the tutting double-masker hate each other, not Whitehall, which avoids becoming the target of widespread public ire. Some might argue that this is a blame-avoidance tactic dressed up as policy. Now, though, we are facing a rewind moment, a potential reset to March 2020. Instead of laissez-faire we are once again instructed to do our best to prevent the spread of the virus. This time, however, we all know from experience we cannot stop it. We can only delay. What price we are each prepared to pay to do that, after 18 months, is anyone’s guess. Government nudgers – long amazed by how compliant we’ve all been – may once again find themselves astonished and delighted. The risk is, of course, that the silent social self-regulation of British people finally gives way, and the phony war between Mask On-ers and Mask Off-ers collapses into open hostility.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s private pilot to be questioned on day two of court caseCoronavirus latest news: Booster jabs will give \u0026#39lots of protection\u0026#39 against omicron, says Boris JohnsonDuke of York avoiding \u0026#39confronting his own misconduct\u0026#39 by blaming his victim, accuser’s lawyers claimIntroducing a \u0026#39woke code\u0026#39 for MPs would represent a flagrant rejection of political liberalismIS member convicted of genocide over systematic killing campaign against YazidisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"masks compulsory shops today iceland boss says wont ask staff","story":"Face masks have once again become mandatory in shops in England from this morning, but one supermarket chain will not be asking its staff to enforce the tighter Covid restrictions. Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that owing to the new Omicron variant, self-isolation would be mandatory for close contacts of the mutation regardless of vaccine status and face coverings must be worn on public transport and in shops.Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said that while he was in favour of the stricter guidance, it was not up to supermarkets to enforce the changes. He told the BBC\u0027s Radio 4 today programme: I suppose the question isn\u0027t whether we should mandate face masks whether we can mandate them. And what I won\u0027t be doing is asking my store colleagues to police those who refuse to adhere to the rules.They\u0027re already working under significant pressure, especially as we hit the busiest trading month of the year.During the first lockdown, Mr Walker received more than 50 reports a week from staff members who had been verbally abused for enforcing mask wearing in shops during the first lockdown in 2020. When he subsequently told his employees to stop challenging customers, this dropped tenfold to around five incidents a week. He added: I think if the Government wants to want this to happen, then they must step in to help businesses like ours and police the wearing of masks.We\u0027ll be politely asking customers to adhere to these new rules. We\u0027re putting up window posters asking them to do so as well. We spend millions on security each year as well about the scale of this is such that we simply cannot police every store every hour of every day. It will cost millions and put us out of business. I think my store colleagues have obviously been heroic throughout the pandemic, making sure that food have been kept on the shelves. And their support has been crucial in building that consumer confidence.The new restrictions are as follows: Retail bosses have warned that they cannot be expected to enforce new rules requiring staff and customers to wear masks in shops.New face covering rules have come into force in England on Tuesday in response to concerns over the Omicron variant of coronavirus.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), stressed that it is the role of the authorities to enforce these new regulations, adding that customers also have responsibility to adhere to the rules.Retailers will be communicating the new rules on face coverings in England through in-store signage and other channels, she said.However, it is vital that we do not place hardworking retail staff in harm\u0027s way, and enforcement of face coverings must remain the duty of the authorities.Furthermore, we all have an inidual responsibility to put on a face covering before entering a shop.It is the latest challenge for retailers ahead of a key Christmas period. They have already seen pressure from supply chain disruption and labour shortages.Ms Dickinson added: While there may be small changes in the way we shop, we ask people to be considerate and we remain confident that everyone can get what they need for a fun and festive Christmas this year.Retail bosses have warned that they have seen rising violence and abuse against shop workers in recent years, but that this has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and enforcement of Covid regulations in stores.People will also now be required to wear face coverings and masks on public transport, too.The Unite trade union has called for face covering to also become mandatory in pubs, cafes and restaurants after they were not included in the rule change.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: We must ask why hospitality is the only area in the public arena where face masks are not compulsory.Does the Government consider the health and safety of hospitality workers less of a priority than that of workers in other sectors?It is outrageous that hospitality workers are being left to police the wearing of face masks due to the lack of proper mandatory rules or effective legislation.Measures to slow the spread of the newly-identified Omicron coronavirus variant came into force on Tuesday.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the rules over the weekend amid concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant.Face coverings are again compulsory in England in shops and settings such as banks, post offices, hairdressers, and public transport, unless people are exempt. Hospitality settings such as pubs and restaurants are not affected.Pupils in year 7 and above, teachers and visitors should wear face coverings in communal areas in schools, colleges and universities in England.The reintroduction of compulsory face coverings brings England closer into line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Anyone entering the UK from any destination abroad will have to take a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate until they have a negative result.Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a Day 2 lateral flow test, and did not have to self-isolate unless they received a positive result.The UK\u0027s travel red list was expanded over the weekend to include 10 African nations: Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe, forcing arrivals into hotel quarantine for 10 days.The booster vaccine campaign has been expanded, with a booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine now offered to all adults three months after people had their second dose of an original vaccine.A second jab will be offered to young people aged 12 to 15.The Prime Minister said: Based on everything we know, our vaccines and boosters remain our best line of defence, so it is more important than ever that people come forward when eligible to get boosted.All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their age or vaccination status. They will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace.The Prime Minister said the measures are proportionate and responsible and will buy us time in the face of this new variant.Scientists are concerned by the Omicron, or B.1.1.529 variant, because it has a high number of spike protein mutations, potentially changing the behaviour of the virus with regards to vaccines, treatments and transmissibility. All this is still uncertain, and the precautions give scientists time to properly study the new variant.The Government said the temporary and precautionary measures will be reviewed in three weeks, just days before Christmas.Unlike in England, people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have to prove their vaccine status to enter nightclubs and other venues.Face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public spaces, including pubs and restaurants in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Working from home is recommended where possible.In Northern Ireland, gatherings of 30 people or more in domestic settings are not permitted.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s private pilot to be questioned on day two of court caseCoronavirus latest news: Booster jabs will give \u0026#39lots of protection\u0026#39 against omicron, says Boris JohnsonDuke of York avoiding \u0026#39confronting his own misconduct\u0026#39 by blaming his victim, accuser’s lawyers claimIntroducing a \u0026#39woke code\u0026#39 for MPs would represent a flagrant rejection of political liberalismIS member convicted of genocide over systematic killing campaign against YazidisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid persuades sky reporter get booster walks get vaccine","story":"The Health Secretary persuaded a journalist to get his booster and walked him to get his vaccine after being interviewed.Sajid Javid was being quizzed on Sky News by the broadcaster\u0027s Chief Political Correspondent Jon Craig near St Thomas\u0027s Hospital in Westminster on Monday night. The pair were chatting as they prepared for the interview outside the vaccination centre when Mr Javid asked the journalist if he had been for his booster jab. He explained that he got Covid whilst covering the Hartlepool by-election and therefore believed he wasn\u0027t eligible for his third dose until Dec 14. The Health Secretary pointed out that the rule changes mean he was now allowed to get his booster, and set about trying to convincing Mr Craig to get topped up. Initially asking the reporter to promise to come back next week to get it done, Mr Javid then realised that the vaccination centre was still open, and that there might be space for walk-ins. Mr Craig pointed out that he needed to get back to work, to which the Health Secretary said: No, no.

So what exactly is changing and how will it affect you  Here are all your questions answered.Where will I need to wear a face mask Face masks are mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices from am on Tuesday. They will also be compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. But masks will not be mandatory in pubs and restaurants, or cinemas and theatres, like they were before. Government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, but this is not a legal requirement. What are the new foreign travel rules From am on Tuesday, all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world must take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Ten African countries were added to England’s red list over the weekend, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. The  nations are Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Those who breach isolation rules can be fined between £ and £,. When will I have to self-isolate All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status.Those affected will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace. It’s not thought the Covid- app will single out those who have to isolate.Elsewhere, people travelling to the UK must self-isolate until their Day  test is negative - as above. People who test positive for Covid must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of vaccine status. And unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated close contacts of a Covid case must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of whether it’s the Omicron iant.Who will get a booster vaccine - and when All adults in the UK will now be offered a Covid booster vaccine - Pfizer or Moderna - in a much shorter time period than before. Third doses will be fast-tracked, with people able to get them three months instead of six months after their second dose. While immunity is said to be better with a six-month gap, the JCVI watchdog weighed that up against the risks of waiting too long with a new iant. However, people will have to wait for their place in the queue. Boosters will be offered in descending order of age in five-year brackets. So -year-olds may have to wait a while. Downing Street was unable to say how long the booster rollout will take. No hopes to see a more detailed timetable published by NHS England “in the coming days”. People should not yet go online and try to booktheyaposre . Meanwhile --year-olds will be offered a second dose. Will schools shut early for Christmas Since Monday, the government is “strongly advising” school pupils above year , staff, and visitors to wear face coverings in communal areas of England’s schools. Local public health teams can send groups of pupils home as a last-ditch measure to stop the spread. But No insisted schools will not shut early for Christmas this year. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said the Government will keep schools open until they had absolutely no choice but to close the institutions down. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People do not need by law to wear masks or show a vaccine passport in hospitality venues. Health Minister Edward Argar said the government will let people in England “use their judgments” about whether to attend festive bashes this year. But the minister also warned people “will reflect carefully on how they are going to react” to the new iant. Voluntary government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, and take a lateral flow test before socialising with other people. Why are these restrictions being introduced Scientists are alarmed by the Omicron iant because it has more than  mutations, which potentially means it could resist the vaccine. Therefore, the government is introducing restrictions to buy time for scientists to work out whether it’s as bad as they fear. At the moment, No admitted, “no one has any hard evidence of its impact on things like hospitalisations”. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said scientists must get live samples of the Omicron virus and test them, asking the public: Please, everyone needs to give us time to assemble that data.He added: “I’m asking people not to panic - but I’m not asking them either to completely ignore the weather forecast.” Are the rules strong enough to work Several key figures say they are not. Labour’s Angela Rayner called for mask mandates to also apply to pubs and other hospitality settings, when people are moving around. She added: “Itaposs so important that people wear masks when theyaposre indoors, in arenas where theyaposre meeting people and... mixing in large numbers.”Scotland and Wales’ First Ministers wrote to Boris Johnson demanding all UK arrivals isolate for eight days, with PCR tests on day  and day . Currently they’ll only have to isolate until a Day  test comes back negative. Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted his approach was “proportionate”. Will the rules be tightened further It is possible. Boris Johnson has not yet enacted all of England’s ‘Plan B’ measures, leaving vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums in reserve. The government has also not advised people in England to work from home where possible, despite advice of that kind in Scotland. Askedthe Government might tighten up England’s rules even further in the next three weeks, minister Edward Argar said: Itaposs not something Iaposm anticipating. But the PM’s spokesman did not rule out tighter travel rules. No said Boris Johnson was not “planning” to adopt Scotland and Wales’ plea for eight days’ isolation, but did not rule it out, saying the response would be kept under review.When will they expire The measures will last three weeks and expire on December , with a review ahead of that. That means they could be ended, continued or strengthened in time for Christmas. MPs will also get a vote on the measures on Tuesday.

Here’s what’s changed and a snap profile of each big playerKeir Starmer and his new team crossing a look left sign this morning Image: PAByDan BloomOnline Political EditorAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Nov | commentsLabouraposs rising stars have been recognised in Sir Keir Starmeraposs second reshuffle of the year, as he seeks to create a serious party of Government. Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson have been given big departments to look after as the leader moves his team further away from the Corbyn-era left.And heavyweights Yvette Cooper and David Lammywon two of the biggest roles in the shadow cabinet.Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided when news of the reshuffle broke, as she was delivering a keynote speech on Labour ’s plans to tackle sleaze.She said: I don’t know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it.  You may have been blindsided too - since it all happened on a major day of Covid news. So who’s rising up the ranks and who was demoted from a top job  Here’s everything you need to know.PROMOTED Yvette Cooper - Shadow Home SecretaryA starto Labour’s top team, the MP since  served under Blair, Brown and Miliband and came third in the  leadership race.Her job as Shadow Home Secretary - where she took on Theresa May - ended when she said she could not serve under Jeremy Corbyn.As DWP Secretary in  she faced controversy over benefit sanctions in the Welfare Reform Bill, and her views on Corbyn cast a shadow for the left. But away from the front bench, she carved out a fearsome reputation as chair of the Home Affairs Committee, sharply interrogating Priti Patel. Born to a union chief and maths teacher, the -year-old went from a state comprehensive to a first-class Oxford degree. After a year off with ME aged  - “I hated every minute of it” - she worked on Bill Clinton’s  presidential bid. Following her ascent in Westminster, she and husband Ed Balls made history as the first married couple to serve in Cabinet together. David Lammy - Shadow Foreign SecretaryThe outspoken -year-old from Tottenham enjoys a promotion from Justice to one of the traditional great offices of state. As a friend of Barack Obama with contacts in the US Senate, he may take more naturally to the role than ‘Red Wall’-focused Lisa Nandy. Elected in , he rose through the ranks under Blair and Brown before a -year backbench spell under Miliband and Corbyn. On the back benches he campaigned powerfully for the Windrush generation and Grenfell victims, which included a friend of his, with viral speeches. He was an outspoken anti-Brexit MP during years of rows and stirred debate in  when he argued Comic Relief ‘perpetuates Band Aid stereotypes’. But he is not easily pigeon-holed, chairing a review of racism in the justice system for the Tory government, and nominating Corbyn for leadership. Wes Streeting - Shadow Health SecretaryAged , the former National Union of Students President and MP since  will be seen as a moderniser in the top team.He worked for the Blairite group Progress for a year after graduating and was a staunch critic of Jeremy Corbyn, joining Keir Starmer ’s front bench in May this year.Born to teenage parents, he grew up on an east London council estate, had free school meals and was the first in his family to go to university.He has personal experience of the NHS, having a kidney removed earlier this year due to cancer.Bridget Phillipson - Shadow Education SecretaryThe -year-old enjoys a promotion from Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury to holding the Tories to account over schools. Elected in , this is the biggest role yet for the Houghton and Sunderland South MP. She joined Labour aged , attended a Catholic school and co-chaired the Oxford University Labour club.A backer of David Miliband, Yvette Cooper, Owen Smith and Keir Starmer, she supported remain and a People’s Voteon Brexit.Peter Kyle - Shadow Northern Ireland SecretaryIt is the first Shadow Cabinet job for the -year-old frontbencher, who was elected to Hove in . He was a vocal opponent of Brexit and led a bid, blocked by Tories, to lower the voting age to . A former special advisor and charity chief, he backed Liz Kendall and Jess Phillips in the  and  leadership elections. Pat McFadden - Shadow Chief Secretary to the TreasuryThis is the first shadow cabinet job for more than a decade for the ex-Blair and Brown minister.From a family of seven children to a labourer and children’s home worker who grew up in Glasgow, -year-old was an advisor to Tony Blair before and after the  election.Shadow Europe Minister under Jeremy Corbyn, he was was sacked by the left-wing leader in . Mr McFadden lost his job for asking the Prime Minister to reject the view that sees terrorist acts as always being a response or a reaction to what we in the west do.MOVED Lisa Nandy - Shadow Levelling Up SecretarySome would see a move from Shadow Foreign Secretary as a demotion, but not the Wigan MP. When the -year-old won her last job a colleague was said to remark: “That’s a lot of towns, Nandy”.And askedshadowing Michael Gove and the government’s key policy area felt like a demotion, Ms Nandy told BBC Breakfast: It felt a little like coming home, to be honest.”She has for years beat the drum about left-behind northern areas, co-founding the Centre For Towns think tank. She co-chaired Owen Smith’s  challenge to Corbyn and ran herself for the top job in , coming third. Steve Reed - Shadow Justice SecretaryThe -year-old is moving from the Shadow Communities Secretary job to his second shadow cabinet post. Unlike many others who’ve been promoted he was consistently a minister under Jeremy Corbyn. Born in Hertfordshire, he worked in publishing for almost two decades before becoming an MP. His dad played for Charlton Athletic and he knew Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker when he went to university in Sheffield. Mr Reed founded the Labour Together group and helped run Keir Starmer’s  leadership campaign. Jo Stevens - Shadow Wales SecretaryFormer Shadow Culture secretary Jo Stevens was demoted to Shadow Welsh Secretary, replacing Nia Grfith. Since September this year she had been up against Nadine Dorries, the controversial Tory minister. Born in Swansea, she worked for a solicitors’ firm before winning Cardf Central in , ousting the Lib Dems.She had this job before under Corbyn, but resigned from it in  to vote against triggering Article  and Brexit. Lucy Powell - Shadow Culture SecretaryAnother sideways move, Lucy Powell shts from the ministry of housing to the ‘ministry of fun’. The Manchester Central MP worked at Labour HQ during the  election and later helped lead an inquest into the party’s  defeat.Jonathan Reynolds - Shadow Business SecretaryThe long-time political aide and MP since  is another survivor through both the Miliband and Corbyn eras.As shadow DWP chief he announced Labour would cut the ‘taper’ in Universal Credit - which the Tories later did.He had suggested he was open to the idea of a Universal Basic Income but later cooled on the costly plan.Louise Haigh - Shadow Transport SecretaryThe -year-old was for a time Parliament’s youngest Labour MP and has enjoyed a steady rise. The former Unite shop steward and Special Constable supported Owen Smith’s  leadership challenge but also served as Policing Minister under Corbyn. More recently she has landed attacks on Tory ministers over Northern Ireland amid chaos over Brexit. After being Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, the Transport brief is her second job. Nick Thomas-Symonds - Shadow Trade SecretaryFew would argue the reshuffle was a demotion for the historian, who has written biographies of Attlee and Bevan. He took a finely-judged approach to the thorny issue of migration in the face of hardline statements by Priti Patel. Elected an MP in , the -year-old is another of those who served in junior ranks throughout Corbyn’s time.Ed Miliband - Shadow Climate Change and Net Zero SecretaryThe former Labour leader had enjoyed ato the shadow cabinet under Keir Starmer. However, his job has now been split into two - one covering business and the other climate change. This will give him more time to focus on climate change, on which he has campaigned relentlessly in recent years. But it could prove dficult for him to land a blow on the government, given the role he’s shadowing doesn’t technically exist.Jon Ashworth - Shadow Work and Pensions SecretaryNicknamed ‘Sparkle’, the No advisor in the Blair Brown years proved a survivor even through the Corbyn era. An MP since a  by-election has had  years of unbroken service on the front bench including as the longest-serving Labour shadow health secretary in history. He was moved while off sick with Covid, but insisted it was good news, telling friends he needed a new challenge.Emily Thornberry - Shadow Attorney GeneralThe MP equivalent of a Duracell bunny, the lawyer was another survivor through the era of Corbyn, who was her Islington constituency neighbour. But she’s slipped from the top of the pack since doing the Shadow Foreign Secretary job under the former leader. She was notorious in  for tweeting a photo of a house in Kent with a white van and England flags. The lawyer was accused of snobbery and was later “squeezed out” of the  Labour leadership race, not winning enough nominations to go to the members’ vote. But her story is not what you might think - she told the Mirror in  how she remembered bailfs coming to her home, where her mum’s cats were put down because she was too poor to care for them. Jim McMahon - Shadow Environment SecretaryThe -year-old - moved from Transport - is another junior member of the top team and like Lisa Nandy, another voice for towns in the north. He was a council leader in Oldham and represented councillors on Labour’s ruling NEC before winning the  Oldham West and Royton by-election. His victory defied fears Corbyn’s Labour would tank at the ballot box - at least then - and he’s been on the front bench almost ever since.OUT Kate Green - Shadow Education Secretary Luke Pollard - Shadow Environment Secretary Nia Grfith - Shadow Welsh Secretary Cat Smith - Shadow Voter Engagement MinisterCharlie Falconer - Shadow Attorney General STAYING PUT Keir Starmer - Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner - Deputy Leader, Shadow First Secretary of State, Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work Rachel Reeves - Shadow Chancellor John Healey - Shadow Defence Secretary Jenny Chapman - Shadow Cabinet Office minister Anneleiese Dodds - Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary and Chair of Labour Policy Review Rosena Allin-Khan - Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health Preet Gill - Shadow Cabinet Minister for International Development Ian Murray - Shadow Scottish Secretary Shabana Mahmoud - National Campaign Co-Ordinator Alan Campbell - Shadow Chief Whip Angela Smith - Shadow Lords Leader Roy Kennedy - Opposition Lords chief whip Thangam Debbonaire - Shadow Commons leaderRead MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Peter KyleJonathan ReynoldsWes StreetingDavid LammyPat McFaddenSteve ReedYvette CooperPoliticsShadow Cabinet reshuffle\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A string of backbenchers declined to don a face covering during a tetchy debate on new Covid regulations to battle the spread of the new Omicron iant. New measures include the mandatory use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and PCR tests for all international arrivals from am on Tuesday.At one point in the debate the Mirror counted  Tories without masks and  wearing them - while three Labour MPs and one Lib Dem MP all had their masks on.MPs usually remove their face coverings to speak in the Commons and it is worth noting that some may have reasons exempting them from wearing them. But a number of Tory backbenchers made it clear they were unhappy with the imposition of new restrictions. SNP frontbencher Dr Philippa Whitford accused the Government of undermining its own mask advice in recent months by failing to wear them in Parliament. Since July, masks have not been mandatory but the guidance recommended people wear them in busy indoor spaces. That guidance has been undermined by the demonstration on television every day of members of the Government benches, she said. People will be led by example, not just the Prime Ministeraposs but others. Boris Johnsonaposs failure to wear a mask during a visit to Hexham General Hospital earlier this month has made it more unlikely that people will obey new mask rules, according to Liberal Democrat MP Daisy Cooper. She said: One of the major problems being faced by GPs in my constituency of St Albans is that some people are refusing to wear masks because they quote aposthat the Prime Minister didnapost have to when he went to a hospitalapos. Can I ask the minister how she intends to lead by example when half of her own colleagues are still refusing to wear masks on the benches opposite   Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup said: We are mandating the use of face coverings. I think we are in a dferent situation in regards to that. She later defended the mask mandate, saying: The broader data shows that even non-medical masks such as cloth masks made of two or three layers may have similar filtration efficiency to surgical masks. In a testy debate, Tory backbenchers lined up to express fury at the boss of the UK Health Security Agency , who called on people to limit socialising in the run up to Christmas. Dr Jenny Harries said the public could slow the spread of the new Omicron iant by reducing their social contacts. But she was slapped down by the PMaposs spokesman, who said: No. Our advice to the public is as set out at the weekend.We have put advice out on face coverings and on inward travellers and those who are identied as having the Omicron iant of coronavirus.  Beyond that we havenapost set out any further guidance to the public. Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup faced repeated questions from angry backbenchers on the remarks, Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne said: Will she deprecate those public appointees who, not withstanding the clear proportionate advice of the chief scientic adviser, have been out on the air waves telling people that they shouldnapost socialise, to the huge detriment of peopleaposs wellbeing and industries struggling to recover from earlier lockdowns  Ms Throup replied: We all do enjoy socialising but aswill appreciate that we are in a dficult situation at the moment, but we have personal responsibility as well. Influential backbencher Steve Baker said the Government was facing chaos. He asked the minister: Is she seriously saying that it is not for ministers to have any particular view on officials employed within the department going out and taking a position which is at odds with the Governmentaposs public policy decision  Becausethat really is now the policy we have got, that even employees of departments can take their own personal positions, we really are facing chaos and the overturning of longstanding Government principles. Ms Throup said: I would like to reiterate that I do not speak for other people but what I am doing today is putting out the measures that we have implemented as of this morning in a timely fashion and it is the measures that we are considering today and from the Governmentaposs point of view this is the legislation we are implementing. MPs will vote on the regulations later, which have already come into force under emergency Covid powers.

Iso Neville, , from London Bridge, spends her time rooting out second hand bargains in vintage shops to add to her wardrobe - and she applies the same rationale to buying for other people too. Stylish Iso, who is head of social media for an art agency, spends an average of £ on her Christmas gts every year - saving about £ compared to the average spend in the UK on gts, according to Atomik Research. She said: As a teen, normal high street clothing shops were too far away for me, without getting a lt from my parents. “Instead, I would my browse the charity shops near home and quickly found there were plenty of treasures there for sale at a bargain price. “Now that I’m older, I don’t see a need to shop at fast fashion stores when second-hand shops have such great quality items.”For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here In , Iso vowed to go  per cent second hand in a bid to save money, avoid waste and help the environment. The blogger said a shocking statistic convinced her to make the change - that there are enough clothes on earth now to clothe the next six generations. “Sustainability is very important to me and there are very good quality clothes in charity shops, which outlive your average clothes in a fast fashion shop,” she said. After making the switch in her own le, Iso has applied her second-hand way of living to her gt buying too. She said: “Friends and family know how much I believe in charity shops, so they now expect all the presents I buy to be second-hand. “No one has ever complained to me, because it’s the thought that counts and, after all, you would never even know the items weren’t new!” She also says people compliment her on her incredible discoveries, which she hopes will lt the stigma attached to buying things second hand. She said: “Since lockdown, it seems a lot of people in the UK have been having a clear out, because there’s so much choice at the moment in charity shops. “You can really find some amazing stuff and I’ve even been able to furnish my home with things I’ve bought at Barnardo’s.” This year, Iso has already found plenty of ideal gts for her loved ones in charity shops. She said: “I have a friend who recently got into tennis, so I found a pack of brand-new Wimbledon tennis balls and pins in a local charity shop, which I’ll give to her this Christmas. “A good top tip for thrty gt giving is to get a plant from the garden centre and buy a plant pot from a charity shop to go with it. “No one would ever know it’s second-hand and they often have very quirky and interesting plant pots for sale. Childrenaposs charity Barnardoaposs teamed up with Atomik Research to commission research into peopleaposs Christmas present intentions this year - which suggested two thirds of people in the UK will consider shopping in charity shops. The research also suggested people consider thoughtfulness as key in finding the perfect gt, with sustainability also an important consideration. Iso said: “I’m very environmentally conscious and Christmas can be quite a wasteful time of year, but it doesn’t have to be. “I use my social media to kind of spread that message and to make sure thatIaposm posting a photo, people are aware that everything Iaposm wearing is second-hand. “A lot of people will have tighter purse strings this Christmas after the effects of the pandemic, so charity shopping is an excellent way to save some extra cash.” Isoaposs five top tips for finding charity shop bargains are: . Search regularly - pop into your local shop twice a month or so as new stock is updated daily. . Browse online - Barnardoaposs has a great website - and Thrt+ allows you to shop second-hand and choose which charity to donate the proceeds to. . Find the premium section - most charity shops have a designated section for better quality items. . Buy books - second-hand books are incredibly cheap and are just as good as their brand-new counterparts. .

Ella Emeryaposs body was found at the home she shared in Milnsbridge, Huddersfield, with Jack Freeth, a Kirklees Council heating engineer, just before am on Saturday, June , . An inquest at Bradford Coroneraposs Court heard Ella who was a legal secretary for solicitors Eaton Smith, and a part-time eyelash technician, had a history of anxiety.Assistant coroner Anglea Brocklehurst heard evidence that the -year-old had attempted to take her own le when she was in a previous relationship. The court heard the couple had a fiery relationship with Ella annoyed at Jack for going out drinking with his friends while she wanted him to stay in more at the home they had bought together. She worried about money and was also stressed by caring for her grandparents whom she visited regularly, Yorkshire Live reports.On the night before her death, Jack had gone for drinks at a local pub to celebrate a friendaposs birthday while she had stayed home. Later that night she began to harbour suspicions that it was not just a boyaposs night out and young women might be present. She feared Jack might be talking to them and when he ed home used his phone in the early hours to text another woman pretending to be him to see what she could discover. But Jack, who was , at the time of her death, said he would never make contact with other women and told the hearing: I loved that girl to bits. The court heard he was initially arrested on suspicion of her murder as West Yorkshire Police began a homicide enquiry.  But he gave police a detailed account of what had happened that night and after no evidence was found of a struggle, the Senior Investigating Officer, Supt Mark Swt, ordered his release and said there would be no criminal investigation. Mrs Brocklehurst said Ellaaposs death was tragic and that as a young girl she had been fearless and outgoing and a protector of her older brother Ronnie who had been bullied. She said that later: She found herself in a relationship with an older man who tried to control her. She found the strength to leave him but she began to doubt her self-worth. She took an overdose. She formed a relationship with Jack and her sensitive emotional triggers were faithfulness and loyalty. She enjoyed decorating her new house but she became distressed by Jackaposs going out with his friends on a regular basis leaving her behind. In an earlier relationship in  she made an attempt to take her own le. This final attempt happened when her partner was asleep and unable to help her. That evening she interpreted events that she thought she was being rejected. There was her clandestine use of Jackaposs phone in the early hours. None of us can know what was in Ellaaposs mind and never will but I am satisfied that she couldnapost continue with her le despite the love and care of so many people around her. She concluded that Ella took her own le. Addressing Ellaaposs mother Jane Emery, and Jack as well as other family members she added: Please accept my sympathy for a beautul young woman who had so much to look forward to but who sadly was unable to see that.

Afterwards, Jane said: It is easy and clear for anyone to see that Ella was the most beautul young woman, but her family and friends know that she was so much more than just this. She was the most considerate, loving and caring person, with a character so much more than just good looks. Her wit, sense of humour and vibrancy lit up any room she entered. With her passing, each one of us will always have a piece of our heart broken and missing that can never be replaced. Ellaaposs motto for le was aposAlways represent magnicenceapos, and thataposs how we will always, and forever remember her. The most magnicent daughter and friend.

Now determined dog owner Rick, from Wigan, is campaigning to put an end to the cruel practice of puppy farming and stop more puppies like Reggie becoming innocent victims of greedy sellers. His Justice For Reggie campaign aims to change the way that dogs are sold online, and thanks to his tireless efforts MPs are set to debate it in Parliament next month. Last year Rick wanted to buy his young son a family dog as a surprise, to bring some happiness to the family after spending months at home during Covid lockdowns. He soon found “beautul” Labrador puppy Reggie on a reputable selling website.  Reggie was slightly cheaper than the other dogs on the website - when Rick asked the seller why this was the case, he was told that the seller had bred the dogs to give one to his grandfather after his dog had died. For the rest of the litter “it wasn’t about the money, it was about finding good homes,” Rick recalls being told - a story which turned out to be untrue. The seller went on to tell more elaborate lies to Rick when he went to visit Reggie - when he came to the address the seller had given him, he noticed that it was very bare. The seller told him that he had only just moved in from outside the area, and also gave this as the reason why the mother of the litter wasn’t there. But any alarm bells were pushed aside when Rick met adorable Reggie for the first time. He “fell in love” with the puppy’s affectionate and playful nature, and ended up taking Reggie with him that day. And all seemed well when Reggie was first brought home - he loved playing with Rick’s son, but seemed to get very tired in between energy spurts. But sadly, Reggie’s health quickly declined over the first night. By the morning, poor Reggie had a bad case of sickness and diarrhoea, and seemed to have no energy at all. Rick took him straight to the vets, where he tested positive for canine parvovirus, a serious virus that is particularly dangerous for young puppies. Poor Reggie had to be quarantined at the vets, and just days later, Rick got the phone call that every dog owner dreads. Reggie’s health had continued to worsen, and the vet tragically recommended that the most humane option would be to put him to sleep. Rick was with Reggie in his final moments, and was heartbroken to lose the newest member of his family so soon. “It was awful, just seeing that le… it’s like he never found affection, he said.  “He found love in our house, and we gave him a load of attention and had a load of toys and everything for him. He never left our side for the short time he was with us.” Reggie’s loss was particularly tough on Rick’s then seven-year-old son, who had bonded with his beloved new puppy instantly. “It was getting close to Christmas, so he said, ‘I wanted a Playstation  for Christmas, butI don’t get a Playstation , can Santa bring me Reggie back ’ “It did cut him up. I saw him talking to the ashes of Reggie on the fireplace quite a bit.” Rick wanted answers from the seller - but when he went back to the house that he had visited Reggie in just days ago, he found it empty. It was later discovered that Reggie had in fact been bred on a puppy farm in Ireland, born and raised in appalling conditions. The puppy and his siblings had been taken away from their mother before the recommended time, and they also hadn’t had their vaccinations, which would have given Reggie a far better chance at fighting off the fatal virus. In the wake of his family’s tragedy Rick set up theJustice For Reggiecampaign, which aims to help put a stop to cruel puppy farming by calling for more regulations for websites around selling dogs online, making it more dficult for sellers to use puppies to earn quick cash.The new measures the campaign is calling for would include sellers having to provide photo ID and proof of address, as well as a minimum number of photographs including ones of the puppies with their mother. They would also ensure that sellers would have to show proof of vet certicates with all vaccination details for puppies. Rick wants to see selling websites finedthey fail to make sure these higher standards are met when it comes to people selling dogs.The issue is set to be debated in Parliament on December , after apetitionset up by Rick and the Justice For Reggie campaign gained over , signatures from fellow dog lovers. Reggie’s Law, named as a tribute to Rick’s beloved puppy, would see the Government introduce regulations for all websites where animals are sold.Rick is set to walk  miles to Downing Street from December , to deliver the petition in person on December . He hopes that the Parliament debate will lead to these new measures being introduced by the Government to help improve the way that dogs are sold online, and stop more puppies like Reggie losing their lives far too soon.

The booster rollout will be offered in order of ascending age groups and has been sped up to reflect growing concern over the impact of the new Covid iant Omicron on a potential wave of infections. The announcement prompted thousands to attempt to register for a booster vaccine appointment on the NHS website. People waited in a queue to access the booking page, with , held in a virtual line ready to book.  By Monday night the NHS website had updated to reflect the new guidance, but said that the JCVI’s plans to offer a booster dose to everyone aged  years old and over was “not yet available”. Many people who waited in the virtual queue found themselves unable to register for a vaccine appointment despite being newly eligible.One person wrote on Twitter : They told me I could book my booster but when I tried it said I was th on the queue and when I got to the front they said, no sorry, not eligible.”When a Daily Mirror journalist under the age of  attempted to register, despite receiving their second dose almost six months ago, they were told they were not yet eligible, despite fitting the new criteria. The notice reads: “You are currently not able to book through this service. If you think youaposre eligible for a booster dose and itaposs been more than  dayssince your second dose, please call the helpline on .”  Meanwhile, people who were already eligible for a booster jab have reportedly struggled to access a vaccine. Some over-s are facing waits of over a month, spending hours on the phone to their GP or booking service, or being directed to vaccination sites tens of miles from where they live, MailOnline reports. One couple in their s, Brian Bull and his partner Jenner, said they encountered dficulties booking their boosters because of confusing instructions on the NHS website. Mr Bull, , was due for his jab nearly a month ago but has been repeatedly turned away from his local clinic in Appleby, Cumbria. He said: “The NHS website said there was a walk-in centre at Penrith. We drove the  miles only for the receptionist to say she knew nothing about it.” In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department for Health said: “The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationpreviously advised that those aged over  years and those at higher risk from coronavirusshould be offered a booster.“This new JCVI advice means those aged  to  will also be eligible for a booster when the NHS calls them forward. The booster will be offered in order of descending age groups, with priority given to the vaccination of older adults and those in a COVID- at-risk group. “In response to the changing risk posed by the Omicron iant, the booster will now be given no sooner than  months after the primary course. In addition, a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID- vaccinefor young people aged  to  years is advised no sooner than  weeks after the first dose. The overall intention of the measures advised above is to accelerate the deployment of COVID- vaccines and raise levels of protection across the population.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The UK Health Security Agency gave the advice as the number of confirmed cases in the UK increased to  this morning, as three more were reported in Scotland. UKHSA head Dr Jenny Harries, told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “Our behaviours in winter and particularly around Christmas we tend to socialise more so I think all of those will need to be taken into account.”Asked whether people should be told to work from home in England, as is happening in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, she said: “We’ve seen that not everybody has gone back to work and I’d like to think of it more in a general way, which iswe all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the iant at bay.  “So I think being careful, not socialising when we don’t particularly need to and particularly going and getting those booster jabs.” So far nine people have been identied with Omicron in Scotland, along with five in England. Dr Harries said there could be a further  “highly likely” cases.The NHS is preparing a plan to ramp up Covid- vaccinations in an effort to protect Britain against an expected wave of the new Omicron iant.Health chiefs are working in a revised strategy for the “most complex phase” of the UK’s vaccination programme to deliver around  million more jabs in the coming months.  There will be a Downing Street briefing providing more detail on when under-s can get a booster this afternoon. The Government has tasked the already-overstretched service to put the booster programme “on steroids, with the interval after second doses halved to three months. Currently around . million doses a week are being administered but this need to rise to the . million being carried out earlier this year. Since then a number of mass vaccination centres have closed and many GPs - tasked with clearing the record NHS backlog - stopped administering the vaccines. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , told BBC Breakfast: “This is a programme which is all about speed.  “So the two challenges are going to be the logistics of actually delivering so much vaccine in a very short time and of course, it’s important that people come forward and receive those jabs in good time so that they can build up that extra immunity that we need to be sure that we’re protected against this new iant. “So itaposs a challenging month ahead for the NHS.” He added: “The worry is thatyou give somebody double work to do, they can’t do whatever  it was that they would have been doing.” The NHS is looking to bring more vaccination hubs back on stream despite already being under more pressure than any other time in its history. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. An NHS England spokesman, said: “The NHS is having to work at extreme pace to respond to this new iant and to put in place the next and most complex phase of the successful Covid- vaccination programme. “Following updated guidance from the JCVI today, the NHS will shortly set out how staff will expand the booster programme – this will include how booster jabs will be given in priority order so that the most vulnerable people are protected first, while also increasing capacity to vaccinate millions more people in a shorter space of time. “The NHS will contact you when you are due to book in for your lesaving booster vaccination, and when you get the call, it’s vital that people come forward as quickly as possible.” Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said that even though vaccination experts have reduced the time frame between second jabs and boosters, it was likely people would still be waiting for a period of months before being called forward. “Many of the premises of vaccine hubs have now reverted to their everyday use,” he told Talk Radio. “Many of the volunteers about got jobs and they’ve gone back to work. “I don’t think it’s going to be possible to get the same kind of speed and capacity as we as we saw earlier . “So allowing people to get jabs from three months after their last dose, in practice, I suspect that most, mostly it will be for four or five, even six months.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON NHSRadio Nottingham Trent UniversityBoris JohnsonBBC BreakfastR TodayPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tanya Rowe, , was charged after she was given a £, Rolex watch and a new car for her son when she met the wealthy -year old retired entrepreneur in a swanky Italian restaurant. Initially Rowe ly claimed she was a manager for Cartiers jewellers but whenever they subsequently met up she took presents and £ a time cash handouts from him. She was accused of duping the pensioner after a suspicious friend of his contacted Cartier. At Chester Crown Court, Rowe, who was charged under the more exotic name Mia Cavalli was cleared of defrauding the OAP but admitted taking money and gts from him and pleaded guilty to a separate charge of possessing faked Cartier payslips which enabled her to rent out a £, apartment in the city. On Monday she appeared for sentencing for the payslips fraud via video link from her bedroom after saying she was too ill to attend court and had mental health issues. She wept as she was sentenced to  months jail suspended for  months and ordered to complete  days of rehabilitation activity requirements after promising she would go straight. The businessman who cannot be named, denied an affair, claiming he had no idea she was an escort and insisted he had leant Rowe the money expecting to be paid back. Text messages emerged during the trial in which Rowe told him: Darling I might run into you tonight and show you how happy I am x - whilst wearing my new watch lol. You excited , the pensioner wrote: I O Yes. He was also said to have purchased a gold sex aide for his young lover, bought DVDs from the Nice aposnapos Naughty adult boutique in Chester, and told her to wear loose bra, no knickers when meeting for a meal in the city.In another exchange of messages ahead of a night out at a Miller and Carter steakhouse he texted: Can we have some fun at the table to which she responded: No...you will wait til you get home. In another message she talked of being a kept mistress and he said: God I enjoyed last night, can we do it again soon   Rowe, who grew up on a council estate in Tottenham, North London, had previously served a five-year, three months stretch over a crime spree in which she filched £, from victims by posing as an Italian heiress waiting to inherit £ million, a top barrister, a Wonderbra model and a terminally ill cancer sufferer. Her bogus CV and forged documents suggested that she had an account with the Queenaposs bank, Coutts  Co. She wore expensive clothes, always travelled by taxi and made a show of eating in restaurants most evenings. She had even claimed to be an interior design guru, brought in to spruce up celebrity chef Heston Blumenthalaposs restaurant The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire. During her criminal career, Rowe, a convicted drug smuggler, also persuaded a leading womanaposs magazine to run a feature describing her battle with cancer and the sad toll on her relationship. Past victims included property landlords, a waitress who lost her £, savings and big companies, including estate agents Hamptons International and Savills and a wealth management firm in Cheltenham. When victims started to chase her for money she would pretend she had terminal cancer. At the time of her sentencing in Gloucester  under a third alias Ryley Cruz, a judge had branded her an exceptionally devious, practised and accomplished liar. After her early release Rowe used the faked payslips to move to Chester under the name Mia Cavalli and in September  she met the complainant at the the cityaposs Caramel Cafe Ristorante. The court heard during a conversation Rowe said she was an events manager with jewellers Cartier and offered to help when he said he was planning to move house. They arranged a viewing appointment and when the pensioner said he was moving into a new apartment, Rowe said she was having a serious operation at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Prosecutors claimed she then told the old man who believed she had breast cancer that she had not been paid by Cartier and was facing eviction from her flat and the man began giving her money.  The court heard he gave her £, to pay the rent, followed by smaller payments of £- to pay for expenses then a further £, the following January. He bought the Rolex watch from Mappin and Webb jewellers in Chester during a visit in which staff claimed they heard her talking for  minutes about her job as an events manager for Cartier, and her working in Paris and Dubai. The old man also forked out a further £, to buy a Ford Focus car for her son Charlie Smith, , at the Evans Halshaw Ford dealership in Chester. During his testimony the businessman insisted the money was loaned and would be paid back with interest as he believed Rowe was in the process of selling a £. million house in Windsor which Heston Blumenthal was interested in purchasing. When asked about their relationship, he insisted they were acquaintances and that it was % not a physical relationship. But he said on one evening when they met up she was half-naked and jumped into his arms, and they ended up on the couch for a fumble. He added she would send him obscene, dirty messages and he would reply in a jocular way. On another night, he was said to be sickened when she turned up at his home with equipment, which turned out to include a sex aid. He said some of his responses to her texts had innocent explanations and denied claims Rowe told him she was actually an escort. Giovanni Baccouche, a director at Caramel Cafe Ristorante where the pair first met said he thought Rowe, a regular customer, was dodgy and claimed she asked him to lend her £, for medical care. He claimed she told him she had a good job for a designer brand. In evidence Rowe insisted the money was given to her voluntarily by the old man as part of a so-called sugar daddy sexual relationship.  She said she first met the pensioner in the Caramel cafe and after learning he was planning to move house, provided contact details for a firm of estate agents. She said she initially told the OAP she worked for Cartier as she was ashamed to admit she was an escort. She claimed she encountered money troubles when she went to Turkey for a £, boob job and her scar became infected. She required urgent treatment and blood transfusions at the Countess of Chester Hospital and she said she told the businessman her true profession when he visited her in hospital. He was said to have responded by saying she had nothing to be ashamed of, and offered to pay her bills. Rowe said the pensioner then became a client of hers, spending up to £ a time to be with her, which included sexual encounters. She claimed he became increasingly obsessive and controlling , with hundreds of messages exchanged between November  and January . He was said to have dropped a surprise pressie of a golden platinum sex toy on her doorstep for Christmas. Rowe and her son, who lives in Windsor, were acquitted of fraud relating to the car but a jury was unable to reach a verdict on a second charge of whether she had defrauded the businessman out of money by ly claiming to work for Cartier and to having breast cancer. Prosecutors later offered no further evidence and a not guilty verdict recorded. Sentencing her for the payslips fraud Judge Simon Berkson said: There was sophistication in the nature of the documents that were provided by a sophisticated fraudster who has many convictions for that type of crime. Sadly, her le as an adult had been spent committing frauds of all types. He ordered the fake payslips being confiscated and told Rowe: I am bearing in mind the evidence you gave in the trial that you wish now to go straight is to be fulfilled and you wonapost have to go back to jail. It wouldnapost be a good plan to go back to your le of fraud. Iaposm giving you a chance - please take it.

At first I wasnapost too worried I thought aposoh Iaposll be able to get a flight soonapos but the months rolled on and on and it didnapost happen.  Iaposd always planned to stay with friends and family, but it got to the point where I felt I was outstaying my welcome a bit. Thataposs when I started to look at buying a house although that was a bit of a shock as well because it was when house prices were going crazy. But I eventually managed to get a three-bed semi in Eccles in November . I came to England with nothing but my clothes, so it really was like starting from scratch - because of lockdown I had to order furnishings online which werenapost available until the March. So I moved into the house with literally just a mattress my daughter lent me and a chair I managed to buy from Dunelm. Friends and family helped out with lending me things until I could get myself organised. After missing two of her husband’s birthdays, including his th, and spending her th without him, she will now soon be able to reunite with him. Now they are planning a joint celebration when she makes it back home this week, and sees out her -hour self-isolation. Diane said she was most looking forward to having some sunshine again.She added: Speaking to my husband yesterday he said it was  degrees at the moment, so Iaposm looking forward to warmer weather and also obviously just seeing Martin after all this time.We will hopefully get away in the caravan and do a bit of relaxing after my self-isolation is over. Now, with a house back in Manchester, the couple hope they canon holiday so Martin can see his grandchildren for the first time. She said she was grateful for being able to watch her grandchildren grow up, despite being cut off from her husband. Diane said that the lockdown has been more dficult for Martin than her in many ways as Victoria has had some of the toughest restrictions around including a nightly curfew at the peak of the pandemic. Even after repatriation flights to Australia started in September, Diane still couldn’t get home because Victoria’s borders remained shit. Dianeaposs son Christopher has said he will look after the place for his mum until she and Martin canagain on their next holiday here.

The Prime Minister is once again facing anxious questions ahead of the festive period as he looks to avoid another disaster similar to  months ago. A year ago England had been in a national lockdown for three weeks, but unknown to the public a new iant - thought to have originated in Kent - was starting to rip through the country. Despite the restrictions, more than , lives were lost to the virus in a week last year - a figure that would tragically rise dramatically in coming days. Fast forward a year and the number of people testing positive is dramatically higher than  levels, but the link between cases and serious illness and death appears to have been dented.However the unwelcome emergence of the Omicron iant, with  confirmed cases in the UK so far, has understandably raised fears of another miserable festive period.Here we look at the latest figures compared to the situation last year, when the PM belatedly scrapped plans for Christmas mixing. Cases Itaposs important to stress at this point that comparing like-for-like is dficult. A year ago England had been in a national lockdown for more than three weeks, and this had caused cases to fall dramatically. Unknown to most at the time a new iant, Delta, was driving up infection rates in parts of the South East in spite of restrictions, and in the weeks to come cases rose to record levels. On November ,  - a Sunday - the Department of Health confirmed , people had tested positive for Covid. Fast forward exactly a year and that number is , - . times more.  Although comparing inidual days can be misleading - especially when one is a Sunday while the other is a weekday - there is a stark dference in the seven-day picture. In the past week there have been , confirmed infections, whereas in  the seven-day total was ,. Looking at cases alone, the UK is undoubtedly in a worse position than it was a year ago - but this is not the full picture. Deaths Yesterday the Department of Health confirmed that a further  lives had been lost to Covid-. The tragic figure meant that in the previous week,  people had died within  days of contracting the virus. This figure is just under a quarter of the weekly death toll a year ago, according to Department of Health data. In the week leading up to November , , , Covid deaths were recorded across the UK. On November  alone there were  fatalities, more than six times higher than the daily figure exactly a year later.While every coronavirus death is a tragedy, the UK is conclusively in a better position than it was  months ago, with vaccines severely denting the link between high cases and hospitalisations and deaths. Hospitalisations Last winter was like no other frontline medics had seen before, and one they never want to see repeated. Yet again, the dference between last yearaposs figures and the current situation is stark. On November , , there were , patients in hospital with Covid- across the UK, according to the Department of Health. Tragically with the lting of lockdown restrictions this would soar, and by the middle of January more than , people were being treated. Latest figures show , people were in hospital with the virus on Friday - the latest figure available, with  in ventilation beds.This is an enormous strain for exhausted NHS staff who are desperate to avoid the horrendous tragedy that unfolded in December and January last year.But again it is impossible not to conclude that vaccines and booster jabs have made the UKaposs current predicament better than it was  months ago. Vaccinations  It was a huge boost to the national morale when Margaret Keenan became the first NHS patient to be vaccinated against Covid. The -year-old was given her first jab at her local hospital in Coventry and said she couldnapost wait to safely spend time with her family. But that wouldnapost happen until December , meaning that this time last year the UK population was unvaccinated, aside from those who had participated in trials. Fast forward a year and the progress has been extraordinary, although there is still some way to go. Latest figures show that  per cent of the population aged above  have had at least one jab, with . million receiving two jabs and . million now with three doses. There is evidence that vaccines begin to wane after six months, prompting a huge booster jab drive with adults urged to take their third jab when they become eligible and avoid the nightmare of last winter.  Variants This is the big unknown. Twelve months ago, although the public didnapost know it, the notorious Delta iant was taking root in parts of the country and would soon become the dominant strain.It wasnapost until the middle of December that a worried Boris Johnson announced that a new highly transmissible version of the virus had been identied.With an unvaccinated population, this spelled disaster in the UK, with Covid deaths spiralling in December and January, finally prompting the PM to impose a third national lockdown. There was an undoubted sense of deja-vu when the government announced at the weekend that the first cases of the Omicron iant had been found on these shores. It remains to be seen whether it can evade vaccines and whether it leads to more serious illness. Medics in South Africa, where the new mutant strain was first identied, have said that it does not appear to be more deadly, but scientists worry it could be more transmissible. So where does this leave Christmas  At the weekend the PM was repeatedly quizzed about his outlook for the festive period. He said he is hopeful that no restrictions will be necessary - but then he said this last year before abruptly admitting his aposbubbleapos plan wasnapost feasible. There are currently  days until Christmas, which in Covid terms is a long time. On November  last year there were , cases, but by Christmas Day this had more than doubled to December . As long as hospitalisations remain comparatively now the government will be optimistic a relatively normal Christmas can go ahead. Experts will be keeping a very close eye on the data over the coming days and weeks.

A smartphone was used to film a CCTV monitor for the -second clip which was posted to Twitter in a shocking security breach which has sparked fury among Navy chiefs.The video shows the F-B Lightning II, taxiing along the runway of the £billlion aircraft carrier as usual. However, the jet appears to struggle to accelerate on approach to the take off ramp. Crew can only watch as the jet trundles up to the edge of the ship, and straight off, into the ocean. The pilot was able to eject and his parachute can be seen floating down towards the water.  They only suffered minor injuries and were quickly recovered from the sea as the jet sank and is believed to be up to a mile underwater now. The unknown sailor recorded a copy of the CCTV footage from HMS Queen Elizabeth’s control tower in the Mediterranean Sea. The Navy confirmed the footage was genuine. The incident itself triggered a desperate underwater race to locate the wreckage of the F-B stealth jet and secure the crash site before Russian ers could get there.  Whilst the cause of the crash is still under investigation, it is believed that the red plastic rain cover for the jet was left on and sucked into an engine. After the incident a fortnight ago, the jet still remains at the bottom of the sea.Speaking to Mail Online, a source said: “What is someone doing recording that on their phone and putting it out there for everyone to speculate about  Thereaposs a trust issue here.“The crash is a sensitive matter – whoever is behind this has forgotten that... If that person is found theyaposll be in deep trouble and will lose any security clearance they have.”  The jet was one of eight British F-s aboard the carrier, and one of  owned by the UK. F-s are a US-designed cutting-edge warplane with stealth and intelligence-gathering capabilities, able to fly at supersonic speeds without being detected. Defence commentator Seb Haggart posted the video on his Twitter page. Sources told the Sun that the pilot realised that there was an issue and tried to abort take-off but could not stop the plane before the end of the runway. It is now understood that the UK is working with the US on a recovery mission to salvage the wreckage. With the US eager not to let their technology fall into Russian hands, the salvage operation is believed to involve ers, miniature submarines and inflatable bags.

It is hoped that the condition will run its course in a fortnight. “It’s now been over a week since my baby has let solid food touch her lips,” she said. “All my baby wants to do is suck her thumb and she can’t even do that. “Literally there’s nothing I can do to take her pain away. Nikki, the paramedic who runs the Tiny Hearts Instagram page, expressed empathy for the mum and daughter. Tiny Hearts said: ” is struggling to drink water because she’s in so much pain from blisters that have completely covered her mouth as a result of the cold sore virus. “My heart absolutely breaks for this family.got the virus at around the same age and I can honestly say it’s one of the most horrendous things to go through. “They can’t eat, they can’t sleep, they refuse medication because it causes more pain… they lose weight, they become dehydrated and can become really sick.  “I’ve spoken about the importance of normalising the sentence ‘don’t kiss my baby’ and although it’s unknown where little Ari picked up the virus, this is your reminder that protecting your little one with some simple rules will hopefully avoid this nightmare, and many other contagious viruses. “Prevention is better than cure so: “Educate your loved ones about the dangers of kissing a baby, ensure exceptional hand washing of you and everyone , limit bubaposs exposure to crowds and anyone with a cold sore or the virus, donapost let your little one share drinks, cutlery or toys and don’t allow anyone to put their fingers in bubs’ mouth.” The HSV-, cold sore or herpes virus can all easily be passed onto babies and toddlers through contact such as a kiss. In the worst case scenario they can prove fatal. It is a chronic long-term condition, which can become active again. Herpes is especially dangerous for babies under six months old and newborn babies because their immune systems are still developing.

Roisin Duffy, from West Belfast, Ireland, said the family have waited two years to have her ceiling fixed after it fell through multiple times. Social rented housing provider Radius Housing has apologised for the delay. The mum-of-four was left with a black eye as she was caught unaware of the failing ceiling while washing the dishes in the kitchen.A leaky radiator also caused the living room ceiling to collapse just over two years ago, BelfastLive reports. Repairs to the property were meant to take place in  but due to the pandemic they were delayed and have not been carried out since. The delay has caused the house to develop mould and damp problems which the mum believes is affecting her and her childrenaposs health. Speaking to Belfast Live, Roisin, said: I cannot bear the thought of having to have another Christmas in a house like this. Just thinking about it has me on the edge of a breakdown, my mental health is ruined living here. We basically live our entire lives in my bedroom because of the damp. Nobody should have to live like this. It is two years since the ceiling collapsed the first time and the second time I was at the sink doing the dishes when everything fell on top of me giving me a black eye. As a result we have an exposed waste pipe above our kitchen and it was left covered in urine.  Can you imagine trying to live your le with something like this. I am trying to raise a young family and I have no kitchen that I am able to use to get kids ready for school in the morning or make tea. You are not able to do anything in the house because it will just get ruined. I have been on antibiotics constantly due to the health problems that this has given us and we have been waiting years for someone to fix this as we are not able to do it ourselves. It was meant to have been done two years ago originally but things were delayed by the pandemic and nothing has been done to sort it since. Radius Housing has apologised for the delay in repairs being carried out on the property and will be making repairs as a matter of urgency in the coming days. A spokesperson for Radius Housing said Our contractor is scheduled to visit this property to prepare it for all necessary repairs on Wednesday December . After the initial repairs were made there was a delay in undertaking the plasterwork and other remedial works due to restrictions brought on by covid and subsequently by issues accessing the property. We understand the frustration the delay in completing these repairs has brought and we apologise for that. We are ensuring that this work is being undertaken as a matter of urgency.

Dr Harries said there could be a further  “highly likely” cases.But how concerned should we be about the new coronavirus iant and could it really derail our festive plans Prof Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, has the answers…How worried should we be about the Omicron iant When any new iant of the virus that causes Covid- is identied, we don’t at first know how infectious it will be, whether it will cause a more serious illness than other iants and how well vaccines will work against it. We therefore need to be cautious and take measures to control the spread of Omicron until this information becomes available. We shouldn’t, however, become unduly anxious. I’ve heard that the iant causes more mild symptoms. Is that true andso why are we worried Some early reports from South Africa suggest that Omicron may cause a milder illness than other iants. However, we will need data from many more people infected with the Omicron iant – particularly older and clinically vulnerable people – before we can reach reliable conclusions about the severity of the illness it causes.Why are they giving more booster jabsthe new iant can evade existing vaccines Two doses of current vaccines provide good protection – and three doses provides even better protection – against the other strains of coronavirus. At present, we have no evidence the Omicron iant can evade existing vaccines. We need to continue with the booster programme as this has been very effective in keeping down the number of infections that can result in hospital admission or death. Does the new iant transmit any dferently We don’t yet have good data on whether Omicron can infect people more easily than other iants. It will gradually emerge in the coming weeks.Does it mean existing Covid treatments like the new antiviral treatments won’t work either  It is possible that some of the newer antiviral treatments won’t work aswell against Omicron as against other iants. However, this will need to be confirmed in research studies.It’s very likely, however, that antiviral treatments will still reduce the severity of illness caused by Omicron.What don’t we know about Omicron and when will we know We currently lack important information about Omicron – such as how infectious it is, whether it causes a more severe illness than other iants, how well vaccines protect against it and whether antiviral drugs will be helpful in reducing the severity of illness it causes. Research is already underway to answer all of these questions. How likely is it to affect Christmas and how We currently have a high Covid- infection rate in the UK. Fortunately, vaccines are keeping down the number of people with a more severe illness, which in turn is keeping the number of hospital admissions and deaths low. If we can get a high uptake of boosters, we should be able to have a more normal Christmas. But everyone should continue with infection control measures and not rely just on vaccination. People who are not vaccinated at allshould also come forward.Will mask wearing really stop it Masks can reduce the spread of infection – particularlya higher specication FFP mask is worn. But they work best when combined with other infection control measures such as vaccination and home-working.Will bringing forward boosters mean they’re not as efficient Bringing forward the booster to three months instead of six after people’s second vaccination won’t reduce its effectiveness in preventing serious illness. The booster dose substantially increases people’s immunity and this can help stop the Omicron iant evading our current vaccines. If the time between jabs is now three months, does that mean I’ll soon need a fourthI had my booster weeks ago The three month gap is for people who have not yet had a booster. If you have already had your booster, you won’t get a fourth dose . Those who have not yet had a booster no longer have to wait six months from their second dose and can have this earlier.What will happen in schools Many schools in England have had large Covid- outbreaks since the new school year started. It’s important that - year old children are vaccinated and also get a second vaccination once the Government has approved this. People working in schools also need to be fully vaccinated with three doses . Any child who is unwell with possible Covid- symptoms should get a PCR test and isolate until the result is back. Improving ventilation and air quality in schools is also essential to reduce the risk of infection. Could there be more travel bans If the Omicron iant spreads further, then more countries may be placed on the Red List. This can happen at very short notice, leaving travellers with the option of either cutting short their trip or facing an expensive stay in a quarantine hotel. Everyone should consider thisthey are planning an overseas trip.Where will I need to wear a face mask Face coverings will be mandatory by law in England’s shops, public transport, hairdressers, banks and post offices from am on Tuesday. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce rules.The Government has not published a full list but masks will not be mandatory in pubs and restaurants or cinemasand theatres like they were before. What are the new foreign travel rules From am on Tuesday, all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world must take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival and isolate until the result comes back negative. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Arrival from Red List countries must go into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. Those who breach isolation can be fined up to £,. When will I have to self-isolate All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their jab status. People who test positive for Covid must still self-isolate for  days and unvaccinated or partially vaccinated close contacts of a Covid case must do the same, regardless of which iant they have.What are the rules in schools The Government is “strongly advising” school pupils above Year , staff and visitors to wear masks in communal areas. Local public health teams can send groups of pupils home as a last-ditch measure to stop the spread.Can Christmas parties and gatherings go ahead Yes, there is no legal restriction on Christmas parties. People do not need to wear masks or show a vaccine passport in hospitality venues.Health Minister Edward Argar said people in England can “use their judgment” about whetherto attend festive bashes this year.Will the rules be tightened further  It is possible. Boris Johnson has not yet enacted all of England’s Plan B measures, leaving vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums in reserve.And people have not been advised to work from home where possible, despite advice of that kind in Scotland. The PM is not planning to adopt Scotland and Wales’ plea for eight days’ isolation for travellers who enter the country, but has not ruled it out.When will they expire They will expire on December  with a review ahead of that meaning they could be strengthened for Christmas.

Today the Scottish government has announced nine people have been identied with the virus within its borders - five in the Lanarkshire area and four in Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Scientists around the world are scrambling to find out whether the new iant is more dangerous and whether vaccines are effective against it.In a hastily-arranged press conference on Saturday, Boris Johnson announced a raft of measures aimed at stopping the new strain - which was first identied in South Africa - from spreading.These include compulsory PCR tests for everyone arriving in the UK, theof face masks in shops and public transport and contacts of those with the Omicron iant ordered to isolate for  days, regardless of vaccine status. Last night officials confirmed that two cases had been identied in London.The iniduals who tested positive are not connected to each other and are not linked to the previously confirmed cases. One case is located in Camden, London, and the other case is located in Wandsworth, London. Both have travel links to southern Africa. It previously emerged that a person who had been to Westminster but had since left the country, also tested positive for the iant.Yesterday The Mirror reported that the case in Essex had been linked to a primary school. Essex County Council posted on Twitter : Following further contact tracing of the known Omicron Covid- case in Brentwood, it has been confirmed that there is a link to Larchwood Primary School based in Pilgrims Hatch. Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, said: It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing. Thataposs why itaposs critical that anyone with Covid- symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately. Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf this morning said there was no established link between Cop or the South Africa rugby match and the Omicron cases.He told BBC Good Morning Scotland: Thereaposs nothing that links these cases or indeed the iant back to Cop or indeed the rugby match.He added: Thereaposs nothing that indicates these cases or this new iant has come via the rugby or Cop but that work of course is still ongoing .  Askedthe Government might tighten up England’s rules even further in the next three weeks, minister Edward Argar said: Itaposs not something Iaposm anticipating. Dr Harries said there is a current period of great uncertainty in understanding the new Omicron iant. She told BBC Breakfast the booster dose of vaccine will we hope, to some extent, counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this iant. Asked whether the UK will see ato work from home guidance, she said: The whole point about the booster programme and the introduction of mandatory face mask-wearing in enclosed public spaces is exactly to try and avoid that because weaposve made huge progress, we have great defences and, in the background, the dominant strain in the UK at the moment is very definitely Delta.  So these vaccines will help that, it will keep serious infection, serious disease and hospitalisations at bay, but we do need this time to try and understand the new iant, and we would much prefer that we have that precautionary approach and then take appropriate actions. Boris Johnson will give a Downing Street press conference this afternoon after new measures took force to tackle the Omicron iant.The Prime Minister will speak after a flurry of announcements over the weekend as scientists found  cases of the strain with more than  mutations in the UK - with more cases expected to follow.He is expected to speak about the new compulsory face mask rules which took effect in England from am today.Mr Johnson will urge people to get their booster vaccines after the rollout was extended to all over-s and the gap between second and third doses halved to three months.

It has so far caused no hospital admissions or death and he believes it could end the pandemic soonerProfessor Karl Lauterbach said Omicron is a Christmas gt Image: Action Press REX ShutterstockByKelly-Ann MillsReporter:,  Nov | commentsThe coronavirus pandemic could be ended sooner than first feared thanks to the Omicron iant, a leading epidemiologist has claimed.This new mutation is believed to have more milder symptoms than all previous iants and could mean coronavirus is treated more like the common cold. Statistics from South Africa, where the iant was first detected and sequenced, has shown that there have been no hospital admissions and no deaths from people with Omicron.Doctors also say people recover from it in just a few days after symptoms including tiredness, headache and muscle aches pass. South African infectious disease expert Professor Salim Abdool Karim also believes existing Covid vaccines should be “highly effective” against the Omicron iant, although we wonapost know for a few more weeks as more people become infected.  Professor Abdool Karim said: “Based on what we know and how the other iants of concern have reacted to vaccine immunity, we can expect that we will still see high effectiveness for hospitalisation and severe disease, and that protection of the vaccines is likely to remain strong.” Professor Abdool Karim, who works at South Africa’s University of KwaZulu-Natal and Columbia University in the United States, said no “red flags” had been raised so far about Omicron. Professor Karl Lauterbach, a clinical epidemiologist who wants to be Germanyaposs next health minister, has called Omicron a Christmas gt. He believes that the  mutations on the spike protein could mean it is optimised to infect people, rather than kill. He added that is in line with how most respiratory viruses evolve and is good that coronavirus has reached this point. The government was swt to act after the Omicron iant was first detected, bringing in PCR tests and self isolation rules for travellers arriving in the UK until they get a negative result.  It also made face coverings mandatory on public transport and in shops from this morning. Children in senior schools along with staff and visitors must all wear face masks in school and all people aged  and over are to be offered a Covid- booster vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has identied two further cases of the Omicron iant in England, bringing the total to five while six cases have also been identied in Scotland. Professor Paul Moss, from the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy at the University of Birmingham and a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, was askedpeople need to cancel their Christmas plans.  He told Sky News: “I don’t think we need to worry too much about that at this stage… the measures that weaposve got in place have a good chance of gaining some control here. “The two ways that we’re adopting to try and control this are: one, in behavioural change to reduce transmission: the travel restrictions more lateral flows masking. “And the second big factor is the immunity and we know that we may lose some immunity with this virus. So what is happening is we are boosting our immune levels to super-high levels with the plans that were introduced yesterday, and that should retain some protection. “What we’ve seen with Covid is that things change very rapidly. And I think we need at least three weeks to assess this.  “We need excellent epidemiology and within the laboratory people are testing the resistance of the virus against vaccinated samples. So we will need that sort of time. And we will know a lot more before Christmas.” He added: “You probably saw that the doctor in South Africa who initially identied it had seen relatively mild cases, which is very encouraging. “However, you know, that’s a much younger population. “It’s the elderly population, we need to worry about – in South Africa only % are above  years whereas we’ve got a much higher proportion.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Mutant CoronavirusCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Prince Charles said he was touched to be invitedPrince Charles attends the transition in Bridgetown, Barbados Image: PAByRussell MyersRoyal editor:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsPrince Charles has acknowledged the barbaric transatlantic slave trade as Barbados celebrated becoming a republic. In a major speech, the Prince of Wales recognised Britain’s dark past which “forever stains our history”. As the Caribbean nation heralded a new dawn at midnight, replacing the Queen as head of state, Charles said he was touched to be invited despite the act of severance with his family. At National Heroes Square, Charles said: “The creation of this Republic offers a new beginning, but it also marks a point on a continuum – a milestone on the long road you have not only travelled, but which you have built. “From the darkest days of our past, and the appalling atrocity of slavery, which forever stains our history, the people of this island forged their path with extraordinary fortitude. “Emancipation, self-government and Independence were your way-points. Freedom, justice and self-determination have been your guides.”  The Queen had been Barbados’s head of state since its independence in , but a debate about becoming a republic has followed at national level since. Supporters said the birth of a republic, exactly  years on, unclasps colonial bonds that have been in place since an English ship claimed the tiny, unpopulated island for King James I in . Barbados received , enslaved Africans between  and , who worked in the sugar plantations and earned fortunes for the English owners. A senior palace source said the Prince was honoured to be involved in the handover and wanted to use the opportunity to “further recognise that the profound injustice of the legacy of the slave trade could never be forgotten”. Charles made similar sentiments on a  visit to Ghana, from where thousands were shipped off to a le of slavery. Britain had been part of the transatlantic slave trade for over  years by the time it was abolished in , although full abolition of slavery did not follow for another generation. Buckingham Palace had said the issue of republicanism was a matter for the people of Barbados to decide, as well as the other  realms where the Queen is head of state. The Barbadian government’s decision is likely to spur discussion of similar proposals in other former colonies such as Jamaica, Australia and Canada.Barbadian pop superstar Rihanna was among the leading figures to attend the ceremony.Service personnel marched past the prince and gave a final salute to the monarchy before the Queen’s standard was lowered and the presidential flag raised. Charles was due to receive the Freedom of Barbados and the Queen wrote a message wishing its people “happiness, peace and prosperity”. Referring to her first visit to “your beautul country” in , she said its people have “held a special place in my heart”, adding: “It is a country rightfully proud of its vibrant culture, its sporting prowess and its natural beauty.”The first president of Barbados is Dame Sandra Mason, the previous governor-general. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK and Barbados will remain “steadfast friends and allies”.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON The QueenPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBuckingham PalaceRoyal FamilyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jenny Afia appeared on the BBC documentary The Princes and The Press last night, with the permission of Meghan. She dismissed claims that Prince Harry and Meghan quit the Royal Family as they wanted a private le.Instead, she said the pair had challenged blatant violations in line with their values. She said: That doesnapost mean, just because you assert your human rights that you then become some kind of Trappist monk, take a vow of silence and you’re not allowed to discuss anything.  “Thataposs not how privacy works. Privacy is about the right to own and control what personal information you choose to share with somebody.” Ms Afia also hit back at bully allegations made against Meghan saying there were massive inaccuracies in the story that she had bullied some of her staff.The allegations surfaced publicly in March this year and were branded a calculated smear campaign by the Sussexes, who fiercely deny any wrongdoing.

An investigation by Buckingham Palace into the claims is currently ongoing but in the BBC show, Ms Afia was asked by presenter Amol Rajanthe story, which first appeared in The Times, was accurate. She told the programme: The overall allegation was that the Duchess of Sussex is guilty of bullying. Absolutely not. The first thing is to be really clear about what bullying is. What bullying actually means is improperly using power deliberately and repeatedly to hurt someone physically or emotionally. The Duchess of Sussex has absolutely denied ever doing that. That said, she wouldnapost want to negate anyoneaposs personal experience.  When askedshe provided any evidence to refute the claims, the lawyer added: It is really hard to prove a negative. Soyou havenapost bullied someone how do you prove you havenapost. Just denying the allegation... doesnapost address the underlying problem that the allegation has been made.The documentary, which aired its first part last week, set out to explore the relationships between Prince William and Prince Harry with the press.In the first episode last week, there were claims that negative stories about Meghan were leaked by courtiers and there was competitiveness between William and Harry’s respective households.In a joint statement that was shown at the end of the documentary both this week and last week, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace and Clarence House said: “A free, responsible and open Press is of vital importance to healthy democracy. “However, too often overblown and unfounded claims from unknown sources are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Zoe, from Hastings, calling into James O’Brien’s LBC radio show on Thursday, said she witnessed the group blocking the leboat.She said they shouted: “‘Don’t bring any more of those home, we’re full up, that’s why we stopped our donations,’ and that kind of really horrible stuff. She added: “It was really upsetting, and you could hear the hatred in their voice.” Zoe said she was on the beach, near the harbour arm, with her boyfriend on November , when they heard the leboat station open, and assumed they had been called out.  She told LBC that as the crew pulled the boat out and were heading into the water a group of people stood directly in a line in front of the boat. Presenter O’Brien asked her: “Are you sure ” She said: “I’m absolutely sure, the police were called. It really shook me to the core and we thought of it yesterday night when we saw the news that people had passed away again [when  people drowned crossing the Channel on November ].” A spokesperson for the RNLI said: “We can confirm an incident was reported to the police. The leboat was able to launch and the station remains on service.” A spokesperson for Sussex police said: We can confirm an incident was reported to the police. The leboat was able to launch and the station remains on service. MP Nadia Whittome tweeted: “Leboat crews are volunteers who put themselves at risk to save others. “It’s shameful that people are abusing them and trying to stop their boats launching. This abuse is fuelled by sections of the media that have vilied refugees and the RNLI. “Solidarity with RNLI Hastings.”A video posted on Twitte r seemed to show the moments before the group blocked the boat, with a man being filmed shouting at the crew: “Don’t bring no more back here! That’s why we stopped our donations.”Whilst a small number in the town vocalised their opposition to helping refugees,  people gathered in Hastings for a vigil on Thursday evening for the  people who died trying to cross the Channel.  Also last week, local businesses and people helped  people who arrived on Hastings’ beaches via leboats. One group of largely men and five teenage boys, spent two days at sea in a small dinghy before Hastings RNLI saved them on November . Once brought in, they were met by police and volunteers from Hastings Supports Refugees who handed out hot drinks, food, warm clothing and blankets. Five days earlier, local businesses came together to help  people, including several children who arrived, on Hastings’ beaches.

Lucy Upton, , and Karen Paskin, , had switched their £ flights to Portugal for an overnight trip to Dublin after earlier hen-do plans were cancelled. But the pair were trapped with other passengers on board flight FR on the tarmac at Birmingham Airport for more than five hours because of the storm which has ravaged the UK. To make matters worse, college lecturer Lucy said passengers were not allowed off the plane due to staff shortages on the ground. The .am flight eventually left Birmingham at about .pm and landed in Dublin at .pm.Mum-of-two Lucy told BirminghamLive : It was a catalogue of errors. After six-and-a-half hours we arrived in Dublin.The flight was meant to leave at .am, but because of the weather staff hadnapost arrived so we were held up.That was fair enough as the weather was bad. The staff did turn up and we were allowed on the plane, which was about .am by this time. We were told the plane needed to be de-iced and also needed to re-fuel. It was almost two hours later at this point and people had missed connecting flights. I think the captain was trying to contact Swissport and was getting radio silence. Apparently they were short-staffed and there was no way anyone could get off the plane as there was no-one to get us off the plane. People asked whatthere was an emergency  And they said aposweaposd just have to basically try and keep them alive until someone comes to help usapos. For over five hours weaposd been on the plane before it left the tarmac. We werenapost offered any drinks or anything like that. You could buy things, but nothing for free to apologise . The pair, both from Solihull, claimed about  passengers were on board. About  to  people - many having missed connecting flights - were eventually allowed off the plane after four hours. They said some people were flying back the same day, so ended up going to the pub in Dublin for a few hours and coming straight back. Lucy added: No-one was allowed to get off the plane for four hours and there was no way anyone could get off the plane. People were getting frustrated. In the end  or  people did get off the flight. I think many had missed connecting flights anyway. Then the luggage had to come off as well. I think everyone was very patient given the circumstances.  Lucy and Karenaposs original Ryanair flights to Portugal for a hen do were cancelled due to the pandemic. They had paid £ between them, but said their only option was to swap them at no cost for flights to Dublin. Weaposve just spent £ on a six-and-a-half hour journey from the moment we got on the plane, explained Lucy. If the hen do and wedding was being pushed back a couple of years, Ryanair said to us weaposd have to transfer the flights each year. You can only do it a year at a time at which point it would cost £ to transfer them for a year and then next year weaposd have to transfer them again, which was another £. My friend and I just said weaposll just do a little trip ourselves and go and get some Christmas presents. Not for one minute did we think this would happen. The icing on the cake was when we were in the air and they sent down the drinks trolley. It got to aisle  and we were on aisle  when cabin crew said apossorry, weaposre going to land soon, we canapost serve you any drinks.apos The pair are due to fly back at pm tonight, Sunday, November . Ryanair were approached for comment. A Swissport spokesperson added: “We are aware that some passengers at Birmingham Airport experienced delays when travelling this weekend. This was due to disruption caused by bad weather.

It is estimated that about one million homes and businesses suffered damage during the first named storm of the season. Weather maps suggest things are set to turn very cold again with a risk of snow over higher ground in the north of the country on Wednesday night.Elsewhere, heavy rain could be accompanied by thunder and hail.  A forecast from Netweather suggests an area of north-east Scotland will see a low of -C on Wednesday morning, with a similar temperature of -C in northern England.It is expected to be even colder on Thursday morning, with Netweather predicting a minimum temperature of -C in central Scotland, the Express reported.Elsewhere, temperatures will be below freezing across most of Britain. Snow maps from Wxcharts suggest cm could fall in north-west Scotland on Wednesday evening. More snow is likely to fall on Thursday, with maps claiming there will be cm in central Scotland, and up to cm between the Midlands and north-west England. The maps suggest north-west Scotland is set to be covered in cm of snow by early Friday. The Weather Outlookaposs Brian Gaze told the Express that cold Arctic air will make aWednesday and Thursday, with a widespread frost likely and showers increasingly turning wintry. He added: Through Thursday night and Friday it looks as though weather fronts will push in from the Atlantic bringing outbreaks of rain which could be preceded by a period of snow in central and northern parts of Britain.  Over high ground there is the possibility of signicant accumulations.The Met Office said cold temperatures will be replaced by a warming trend on Monday, followed by another dip in temperatures on Wednesday night.Spokesman Oli Claydon said: “The whole of the UK will turn milder. The places that will hold on to the cold air the longest will be in the south-east of the UK. “The low temperatures willon Wednesday and Thursday night. “However, I don’t think it will be quite as low as we have seen before. “It will still be below zero, but more like -C or -C.” Meanwhile, engineers have been drafted in from across the UK to help thousands of homes still without power following the destructive Storm Arwen. The Energy Networks Associationsaid the number of UK homes powerless as of pm on Monday was ,, although around ,, homes and businesses are believed to have been damaged overall.  The worst-affected areas remain Scotland and north-east England, with engineers drafted in from Northern Ireland and southern England to help repair faults and “signicant damage” to the network.Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to help Scotland cope with the aftermath of the stormIn Wales, rail services will be affected this week as trains that ran over debris-littered tracks are repaired, Transport for Wales said. Met Office five-day weather forecast Tuesday Many areas mostly cloudy, although a few brighter breaks especially in the east and south, and to the lee of hills where.

Nnenna Joseph, , told MyLondon she was due to start a course at the University of London this year but has been been stopped as she is left unable to pay her first tuition instalment of over £,.Nnenna was due to start her course in International Communication and Development, but she states the university is not willing to provide flexibility, as well as no longer sponsoring her visa. Now she is left stranded in London and may face deportation. Nnenna has been left heartbroken facing the loss of both her father and her dream course. She said: On the first of October I lost a parent. He’s always been my shield he has a way of sorting me out, he always had a way of sorting us.  Right now I feel, we all do the whole family, we’re all at that point where we’re like where is he  Why did he have to leave just right now when we need him the most  Nnenna was due to start her course on October , flying from Nigeria to the UK where she lived with her parents Joseph and Mary, and her two siblings. Sadly her father had been feeling unwell for several days but stated he was feeling better - so Nnenna caught her flight to the UK. But even before she could step foot onboard the plane, she got the heartbreaking call that her father had died. Nnenna then delayed her trip to the UK by two days after being rocked by the shocking news. More devastating news followed as Nnenna was told she would be unable to access her tuition money from her fatheraposs account - Nnenna, who was , miles away in London, was told by her mother she had to be in Nigeria in person to access the money from the bank. The only option given by the university was pay your tuition or defer. Nnenna tried many times to explain to the university of London her unfortunate situation but they merely offered her one week to pay the tuition or face losing her course.  She added: Then after that, they said theyaposd reported me to the home office and disconnected my IT access. They could have at least arranged a meeting and had a conversation with me to actually seeI’m genuine or not but they didn’t do that, they just gave me one week to pay and nothing . She claims her tutors offered her support and tried to explain the situation to the registration team but they refused to change their decision. Nnenna insists she has no family or friends in the UK and no money to support herself - she is now living in fear the Home Office may attempt to deport her after the university notied them. She currently lives with a friend she met online who has kindly been paying rent for both of them and offering meals. Nnenna says she has been her aposstrengthapos but that the situation makes her feel aposdreadfulapos. To gather funds, Nnenna has set up a fundraiser to raise money for her tuition. She said: To the people who’ve already donated I want to say a very big thank you, I am very grateful, gratitude is all I have. I can’t pay anyone back all I have is gratitude and prayers. And to those who choose to donate after this I wish that God provides for them to be able to donate, and to those who are just praying for me - because it’s not just donations people are praying and wishing me well. I say a very big thank you to them, thank you to every one of you, I pray you never lose a loved one when you need them most, and you never become stranded in a place where you have no friends, no relations, no family.If you want to donate to help Nnenna you can do so here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Home OfficeUniversity of LondonEducationTuition fees\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In particular, we owe it to ourselves and others to be jabbed. Unite  fight  With a flailing Boris Johnson and ided Tories running a tired government, unity and verve are needed for Labour to be in with a decent shout at the next election. Yesterday’s Labour reshuffle started badly with strains publicly exposed again between leader Keir Starmer and deputy Angela Rayner so the fresh team will be under the microscope during the next few weeks and months. If Labour is to appeal to voters as an alternative government the party must pull together and sing from the same hymn sheet. Tory sleaze, a social care con, the Great Train Robbery and a Peppa Pig’s ear of a speech by the PM put Labour back in the game. The challenge now is to win every argument or history will ask not only why Johnson won again in  or , but why Labour lost. Gale force fine Storm Arwen did its worst, but Tan Hill Inn drinkers are out, while the I’m a Celeb crowd itch to get back into their castle.

A Southwest Airline Employee attempted to stop her - but police eventually had to take her away. Another clip showed airport police searching through the womanaposs belongings after her attempt.

The British socialiteaposs lawyer Bobbi Sternheim, who has previously defended al-Qaeda terrorists and Mafia mob killers, painted a portrait of the billionaire paedophile Epstein in court. Maxwell, , is charged with recruiting, grooming and abusing four underage girls for her one-time boyfriend, who took his le in prison while before he could be tried on sex abuse charges. Today Sternheim told the court: “I said before Epstein was a manipulator, but he was also a mysterious man without attachment. He had no we. He had no children. And he had no boss. Yet he attracted all these rich and powerful people before and after his fall from grace back around . “In many regards, he was like a st-century James Bond. His mystery has stirred interest.”  She accused Epstein’s accusers of having shaken the “money tree” in terms of applying for compensation from his victim’s fund. Referring to the victim known in court as aposJaneapos, Sternheim says she refused to tell her story before and only came forward once the compensation scheme had been launched. “You will learn that Jane was in a beauty pageant,” Sternheim said. The lawyer said she modelled, sang, and travelled nationally and internationally from a young age as she attended auditions and even had an agent in New York. “Jane did take some flights on Epstein’s dime and she went to New York and some other places as well, she said. A month before Epstein’s arrest in , Jane did not want to be involved in any criminal case involving Epstein. But after Epstein died she changed her mind. When money was on the line she changed her mind.  She hired a lawyer. She became a client, got in touch with the government and said she changed her mind. “She is a consummate actress and is a pro at playing roles,” she said of the alleged victim. “As her scripts and characters changed, so has the story you will hear. “When money was on the line, she tagged Ghislaine. She got her application before the fund and she received  million. “Examine critically Sternheim urged the jury. If convicted on all six counts, Maxwell, who was wearing a white turtleneck and dark trousers while supported in court by her older sister Isabel, faces a maximum of  years in prisonthe sentences are to be served consecutively.  It would effectively see the socialite, a pal of Prince Andrew, handed a le sentence and dying behind bars.

There were numerous reports in the Birmingham Mail, while Cumbria Constabulary said a van driver in the town ed to find an empty parking space having gone inside to fetch hot water.

The metre-long asteroid travels at , miles per hour and also dwarfs the Shard in London.It is said to not pose a threat to Earth but NASAregards it possibly concerning as it fits into their parameters of being at least metres in size and within .million miles of Earth’s orbit.It will fly past our orbit on December , at a distance of some .million miles away - around  times the distance between our planet and the moon.  Astronomer Eleanor Helin first spotted it on February ,  and it made its closest approach to Earth in  Nereus is an asteroid of interest for robotic missions from NASA and JAXA, which is the Japanese space agency. Since itaposs relatively close and passes by Earth frequently, it was a prime candidate for JAXA to send their Hayabusa spacecraft to Nereus before settling for another asteroid named  Itokawa. While Nereus may not pose a threat anytime soon, for the asteroids that do seem hazardous, NASA has developed the DART mission.  DART, or to give it its full name the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, is the first test of a new technology to prevent future asteroid collisions of the type that ended the age of the dinosaurs. It is designed to “punch” an asteroid off course. It’s the first demonstration of a “kinetic impactor technique” – essentially a high-powered gun – which is designed to change the motion of an asteroid in space. DART will attempt to intercept  Didymos, a near-Earth asteroid which is orbited by a tiny “moonlet” called Dimorphos. The -foot wide mini-moon will be struck by DART, which weighs almost  stone, at a speed of almost ,mph. If successful, scientists will be able to detect a change in the space rock’s orbit. But we won’t know for a while. It will take  months to travel the .m miles to Dimorphos and the collision will not take place until late September or early October .

Dr Coetzee told the AFP that she alerted health officials of a clinical picture that doesnapost fit Delta on  November when seven patients showed dferent symptoms that seemed very much related to normal viral infection. What is Omicron   The Omicron strain, or B..., is a super mutant iant which has  genetic mutations, over  of them being spike protein mutations. With traits seen in previous iants as well as three new changes that have never been seen before, scientists have expressed worry over Omicronaposs transmissibility and ability to evade immunity from vaccines and previous infections. What are the symptoms of Omicron Dr Coetzee told the BBC that the symptoms of Omicron are mild.She said her patients presented with extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, scratchy throat and dry cough. Unlike the previous iants, this one doesnapost cause loss of taste or smell, she added.  The World Health Organisationsaid that initially reported infections were among university students exhibiting mild illness, adding that the severity of the iant won’t be clear until days or even weeks from now. How is it dferent to the Delta iant   Compared to the Delta iant, Dr Coetzee has said the symptoms are very, very mild, with no patients being admitted to surgeries over infections so far. She highlighted that most patients with Omicron could be treated at home. Though cases are not severe yet, Dr Coetzee warned: What we have to worry about is older, unvaccinated people. If they are not vaccinated, we are going to see many people with a severe form of the disease. What to doyou have symptoms of Covid-  Anyone with any symptoms of Covid need to stay at home and self-isolate immediately.Arrange a PCR test as soon as possible, whether or not youaposve received one or two doses of the vaccine. The UK government is also set to reintroduce masks in public transport and retail settings, as well as requiring people flying in to take a day two PCR test and self-isolate until they get a negative result.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON CoronavirusMutant CoronavirusDeltaWorld Health OrganisationHeart diseasePublic transportOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pocket - now often omitted from newer designs - has gone unnoticed for years. And many who spotted it never realised its true purpose. But it is actually sewn in for hygiene reasons and is the gusset of the underwear.Gussets often are made with moisture-wicking breathable fabric, such as cotton, which helps to make sure your nether regions are dry and ventilated, the Daily Star reports. They also are highly absorbent and prevent friction, which can reduce the risk of infection. Synthetic materials, on the other hand, don’t provide protection against rubbing, sweat and bacteria - so the cotton insert is important. The revelation comes afterwomen also discovered the real reason why there are bows on the front of knickers .A curious Reddit asked the question in a forum: Why do so many panties have that little bow on the centre front  Where did the tradition come from  One person replied: As for the roots of the tradition  It comes from pre-elastic days, when your underthings were held in place by a bit of ribbon threaded through the eyelet lace at the tops. The little bow is where you tied that ribbon, and of course itaposs in the front because thataposs the easiest place to do something like that. However, there is even more backstory to the bow. According to another Reddit poster, women previously would have gotten up before the daylight and dressed in the dark or by candlelight. They claimed the bows helped them work out which way round their knickers were supposed to go. Today, the bows are mostly used for decorative purposes, though.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditCredit cardsUnderwear\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

trees embrace the lake of the same name, making it feel like a hidden world.We took the upper path this time, my we Katersquos favourite route in the wood. It initially took us away from the lakeside but it kept our dog safe from the toxic algae which we were concerned may still be present in the water. Our kids tend to vanish when we enter a wood, their laughter telling us they are playing somewhere close by but out of sight. Such was the case on this day as we meandered up the hill, exploring and admiring the views.A roe deer suddenly bolted from the undergrowth in front of us, taking us all by surprise. It must have been watching us approach, standing still and unseen in the nearby undergrowth. I wonderedwersquod have seen it at allit hadnrsquot decided to run away.Although it was late November, the tree canopy still had a patchwork of autumn colour. The colours were made more vivid when the sun began to set, casting a stream of golden rays through the wood, and for a moment making the lake sparkle. Such moments canrsquot be planned, just enjoyed and appreciated when they happen.Then we heard wild screams from the younger kids. ldquoFaery apples! was the cry. Tiny apples, the size of cherries, carpeted the ground. They had never seen such small apples and came running holding handfuls of them, wonderingthey could eat them.I explained they were crab apples, fallen from the crab apple tree which grew all twisty near the path.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot eat them raw, I explained, ldquobut you can cook them and make crab apple jelly. The moment I said that, I knew Irsquod given myself a task. ldquoCan we make it tonight  was the predictable reply.I will be honest, I have never made crab apple jelly but there is a first time for everything and so we gathered a pile of the tiny apples.We spent more than three hours exploring the wood, finally reaching the end of the lake after many detours and explorations. We took a lower path back to the car, but my we and I noticed something the kids didnrsquot: the sun was below the horizon and it would soon be dark. We hadnrsquot paid much attention to the time but the sun had given us some warning earlier on as it spread its final rays through the wood.We didnrsquot say anything lest the kids got spooked, but we tried to discreetly speed our step so we would reach the car park before it got completely dark. It wasnrsquot easy, as the kids played in the fallen leaves and explored side paths.Finally they noticed. ldquoItrsquos getting dark, one said.ldquoNo, it is dark! replied another.Indeed it was, although we could still see where we were going. The trees now had a dferent guise: dark silhouettes making eerie shapes in the imagination.Then it happened.The moon appeared in the cloudless sky, a nearly full moon, initially reddish in colour, then bright. It was a primeval experience, the lsquobeaver moonrsquo in the sky, lighting our way through an ancient wood. Our son did his best to spook his sisters with tales of werewolves but that just set off a crescendo of imitated wolf howling from them all. It certainly made them all feel much braver in the dark, moonlit wood.When we finally reached the car, I had a tinge of melancholy that we were leaving. But I was glad we had dallied and not noticed the sun disappearing. During our journey in the darkness, we could see the sky through the thinned tree branches in ways we cannot from home.

Katona was a child protection barrister for  years before opening her first Mowgli restaurant in Liverpool in . Now she has numerous branchesand then theres cookbooks to write, telly to do and her charitable Mowgli Trust to run. Minute Mowgli is not just about using up ingredients. Things might be busy, but regardless, \"We have big flavour requirements in our house,\" she says.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Mowgli Street Food \"Big flavour is really important,\" says Katona, and its not just her familydemanding it of their food. \"The British now want big, instant flavour its not enough just to boil cabbage and serve it with butter, although thats a beautul thing as well.\"Sometimes you do want to have a bit of flair. And so its really important that we understand the way this nation eats has changed, and [is better] for it! Thats what makes us such an innovative nation and so cutting edge in so many ways, because we look at the way the world does things and we learn from it. And that includes big flavour.\"She feels a responsibility to share her inherited Bengali, and wider Indian, food knowledge. \"We first-generation and second-generation Indians will pass away. What we need to do is make sure the British public who want to cook Indian food can authentically conjure it, because weve passed the formulas down.\"Katona continues: \"Its my ancestors - this way of cooking that I have, its thousands of years old... These came from my ancestors through my grandmother, through my great-grandmother, through my mother to me.\" And now to us, via her recipes.Katona learnt to speak Hungarian so she could cook her mother-in-laws recipes. \"I wanted to learn how to cook, so it started off with the language of the kitchen,\" she says, likening the homely heart-warming Hungarian way of eating with her own Indian upbringing. \"We both came from relatively poor backgrounds, you use every part of every ingredient - meat on the bone, you cook with thighs we really cooked with the same sorts of ingredients,\" says Katona, who shares several of her mother-in-laws recipes in the book, including her little sparrow dumpling soup and paprika chicken.And Katona really wastes nothing. In her opinion, broccoli stalks are the tastiest bit, bones stay in, and her grandmothers best curry was actually a potato peel curryShe also has a particular fondness for cabbages, because theyll sit for two months in your fridge quite happily. \"We mustnt be afraid of food that is sitting there quietly, patiently waiting. This whip behind our feet of sell-by dates can be one of the worst things in terms of food wastage,\" she says. \"Look at it, smell it, has it grown its own ecosystem  If not, peel the outer leaves off and youre away.\"Katonas career in law has certainly helped shape how she eats and cooks. To learn the trade, \"You have to sit around the table and eat with other barristers and judges and learn the ropes from them over food\", she explains, adding with a laugh: \"Food has always been a big part of a lawyers le very often you go for lunch and you negotiate your best deals over food, where peoples hearts and minds are a bit softened.\"That forensic mind is helpful when it comes to flavour-based decision making - like the time Katona blitzed up a gingerbread house and used it to coat lamb chops , and when she sloshed her gin and tonic over salmon as a marinade at a barbecue . She says \"idleness and cutting corners\" can lead to some of the best inventions. The Rice Krispies in her snacky bhel puri arent a shortcut, though theyre essential. \"That is honestly how my family eat it.\"Throughout the book, Katona speaks of her ancestral home in India where instead of \"normal toys\" she learnt to prep fish on her Bengali grandmothers veranda. \"There werent acres of coloured plastic when I was growing up, so what you would do is you would scale fish, gut fish, wash fish you would mince meat, make kebabs with your hands. Before you could speak, youre mixing dough.\"She recalls fish scales going everywhere, all in her hair, and being able to make such a mess, because the whole veranda would be washed clean with a bucket of water and left to bake dry in the sun.Then theres her Indian fish finger sandwich recipe, inspired by long car journeys to McDonalds in London in the late Seventies. \"Honestly, we were driving for those fries and for a Filet-O-Fish - we felt as though they had made that specically for the Indian community, and its still got a charm,\" she says. Katona recalls how her mum would zhuzh her bun up with homemade green chilli pickle and slivers of red onion: \"My mother still really reveres the Filet-O-Fish.\" Thats some big, instant flavour we can definitely get behind.

Let us hope that they come to realise that they must cooperate strenuously to fulfil the pious mantra that no one is safe until everyone is safe.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.STURGEONS SCAREMONGERINGAS we have seen and heard all too often during the Covid pandemic, given the content, tone and manner of Nicola Sturgeons rhetoric over the last  hours regarding the new Omicron iant, we now witness again that her communication is tantamount to scaremongering.Her hyperbole is not only wholly unwarranted and unnecessary, but is at odds with the majority of the professional medical opinion so far communicated, is most dangerous in the behavioural responses it might evoke, and is frankly nothing more than the rantings of a failing despot.Your own headline this morning, ldquoSturgeon fires warning as third case is linked to UK , says it all. Her talk of possible travel restrictions, aof indoor gathering controls and limitations, all on the back of only ndash at time of writing ndash six cases of the new iant in Scotland and no deaths as a result of it.Communicating what she does and how she does it, Nicola Sturgeon herself will be the cause of panic, distress and dangerous uncertainty, not the new Omicron iant.Paul McPhail, Glasgow.FLAWED DECISION TO DROP VALVENAOMICRON is now here in Scotland. And  million doses of a Scottish-made vaccine, Valvena, that would have been effective in fighting this dangerous new iant was cancelled by the UK Government just two months ago.Current vaccines, such as AstraZeneca, target the protein spikes, which are the parts of the virus that mutate. Valneva, by contrast, introduces a whole neutralised Covid virus into the body, not just the spike proteins, giving a broader immune response by increasing the memory cells that recognise all parts of the virus should infection occur.A year ago, former vaccine head Kate Bingham had ordered  million doses of Valneva, recognising its potential to provide a better immune response against future iants. The UK Government then cancelled the order, citing breach of contract, which Valneva denies. She called the abrupt cancellation inexplicable. Professor Adam Finn of JCVI is among several scientists urging the UK to reconsider Valneva. He said we need more than one vaccine option to deal with ldquoan unpredictable, dangerous iant like Omicron.One canrsquot help but suspect that the UK Governmentrsquos refusal to use Valneva was because of its Scottish French origins. Scotland is used to being dissed by Westminster, as we saw in the decision not to develop the shovel-ready Aberdeenshire carbon capture project. Only by ending an unequal Union that has served us so badly will we be able to make decisions that finally benefit Scotland.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.AN EXCUSE FOR THE PMHOW convenient that a new iant of Covid- has emerged just in time to give Boris Johnson a good excuse for restoring the restrictions which he should never have removed in the first place the more cautious policy of our much-maligned Scottish Government has been clearly vindicated.Am I the only person who heard the interview with the South African doctor who first spotted the new iant  She explained that none of the patients affected by it had experienced anything more than mild symptoms and it was clear that she did not consider that any panic measures were required.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.LOSE THE SNP BY VOTING YESMAY I please reassure Michael Watsonthat the SNP-free Scotland he wishes may very well be available to him after, but only after, independence.Parties may change, but Mr Watsonrsquos right to vote for his choice will not, and like every other eligible voter, he will get the government the majority elect.Anent the rant from Douglas Coweagainst ldquogullible supporters of Nicola Sturgeon, and his dubious, unspecied statistics, it would be interesting to hear his views on the proportion of anti-Tory votes regularly cast for Westminster, under a much less representative system. He will find that the percentage voting against the Tories is consistently very much higher than recorded against the SNP here. Yet we have had Tory governments with sometimes huge majorities, on a vote share of less than %.His characterisation of SNP supporters as ldquogullible is an insult to the intelligence of a proven vast number of Scots. I suspect that the gullibility boot is on the other foot.P Davidson, Falkirk.CURRENCY CONFUSIONTHE SNP conference has once again supported the idea of a secessionist Scotland adopting its own currency, in spite of the manold dficulties that would create for people with mortgages and loans contracted in pounds sterling . This signals rank and file support for the plans of Dr Tim Rideout for a Scottish Reserve Bank. Yet the official SNP line remains that a separate Scotland would continue to use the pound for an unspecied time after any split with the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, her ministers and SNP elected members tell us that the Scottish public overwhelmingly favour retaining the pound. That is the message they hear on the doorsteps.So which is it  A party intent on putting a major constitutional choice before us must surely know which currency it intends to adopt  Or not Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.* CONGRATULATIONS to the ordinary members of the SNP in conference last weekend who overwhelmingly endorsed the principle of establishing a Scottish Central Bank and currency following independence.This removes any further discussion on retaining sterling and the Establishment trappings advocated by Alex Salmondrsquos Council of Economic Advisors in  and the Charlotte Street lobbyists who concocted the suicide pill called the Growth Commission Report in .Perhaps now the several \"alternative monetary policy\" groups will receive some long overdue encouragement in their work of drafting Scotlandrsquos banking regulations and paving the way to re-establishing Scotlandrsquos international reputation for fair, equitable and mutual financial institutions.RF Morrison, Helensburgh.NOTHING FOR JOHNSON TO FEARWELL, well, well, therersquos a surprise. The SNP is to table a motion of censure on Boris Johnson . This is standard nationalist deflection tactics and clearly an attempt to reassure the troops and take attention away from the fact that its dream is even further off than it was .Its censure motion on the Prime Minister is a bigger joke than even Mr Johnson. He is unlikely to be quaking in his shoes.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.Read more: If our politics are broken, donrsquot overlook the Toriesrsquo contribution"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13251058.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hampden-site-kick-off-historic-grounds-unesco-world-heritage-bid","story":"This year Footballrsquos Square Mile, the Worldrsquos Biggest Open-Air Football Museum, was launched following the discovery of the foundations of the worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground - The st Hampden Park.Now those behind the move, The Hampden Collection, are taking things one step further and have today launched a bid for Unesco World Heritage Site status for Scotlandrsquos unique football history.Read more:First Hampden Park campaigners in bid for World Heritage Site statusAs reported in The Herald, the st Hampden was lsquolostrsquo for more than  years until extensive research revealed the only known map of its location in the National Records of Scotland in .The Hampden Collection was founded to promote this discovery and campaign for recognition of the three Hampden Parks, and all who played on them.Earlier this year Archaeology Scotland found the foundation stones of the original Hampden pavilion, beer bottles, clay pipes and teacups from the period, and wire fencing, which encompassed the original pitch.Hampden walking tours have proved popularGraeme Brown, of The Hampden Collection, said: ldquost Hampden is the lsquocentre spotrsquo of what we have termed lsquoFootballrsquos Square Milersquo, which is the worldrsquos most important football heritage site.This Square Mile encompasses the st, nd and rd Hampden, birthplaces of the Glasgow Football Club Titans: Queenrsquos Park, rd Lanark, Rangers and Celtic.

Queenrsquos Park, widely considered to be the grand architects of modern football, built the worldrsquos first purposefully built, enclosed international football ground at st Hampden, created many of the rules and inventions used today, and created the template for how fans watch the game, including the fabled season ticket.Mr Brown added: ldquoOur mission is to take back Scotlandrsquos footballing heritage from those who have either rewritten it, or done little with it. Football is the lsquoPeoplesrsquo Beautul Gamersquo, crafted and created in Scotland for the world to enjoy and now watched by .bn people.\"The launch of the campaign coincides with the th anniversary of the worldrsquos first international football match, held at West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick, Glasgow, on St Andrewrsquos Day, .

Following the success of this event, Queenrsquos Park realised they had to build their own ground, and in , they opened st Hampden Park. In the following years, after this seismic event, football exploded across Scotland and began to take the world by storm, with the Scotch Professors leading the way.Leeann Dempster, Chief Executive of Queenrsquos Park Football Club, said: ldquoThe history of Queenrsquos Park is synonymous with Scottish Football, and we are delighted the heritage of the three Hampden Parks is being recognised, which forms a large part of the square mile footprint.This campaign will give the birthplace of modern football the biggest accolade of all, and I encourage everyone to learn the story of the Scotch Professors, and how they invented and exported the modern game.With  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international which will coincide with the first winter World Cup, Mr Brown believes they have they right credentials for Unesco status.He added: ldquoThere are ten selection criteria for UNESCO World Heritage Status, including lsquoto represent a masterpiece of human creative geniusrsquo and lsquoto bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappearedrsquo. We can argue Footballrsquos Square Mile has five of the  criteria set out by Unesco, and we only need one. There are twelve months to garner grass root support for this project and turn it into a viable reality.Jacqui Fernie, Co-Chair of the Friends of Cathcart Cemetery is supporting the Unesco campaign saying: ldquoGaining UNESCO World Heritage status would be immense for the area. This application recognises the lives and history of the people who played such a pivotal role in the development and growth of the game, and the unique place the Cathcart Cemetery has in celebrating their lives."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-deja-vu-alpha-omicron-uncertainty-ahead","story":"Within weeks it became clear that a highly transmissible new iant later dubbed Alpha, which had spread from Kent, would slow theto normality and cause thousands of extra Covid deaths in the process during a devastating winter wave.Confirmed Covid cases have been falling in Scotland since mid-November Twelve months later, many scientists believed the virus had evolved into its peakform with the subsequent rise of Delta, a strain which crushed and outcompeted all others wherever it took hold.Now, having amassed half a Greek alphabet of iants already, the world is faced with a new unknown: Omicron.: Omicron most challenging development in months, warns SturgeonLike the first iant of concern Alpha, it shares a marker - the S-gene dropout - which enables potential cases to be detected quickly in PCR testing before being confirmed through genomic sequencing.Surveillance indicates that these S-drop cases began rising from November , though not all were Omicron.

three days before the summit ended - but the iant had almost certainly been spreading in Africa for weeks.So far contact tracing has found no link.However, there is evidence of community transmission - described as \"limited\" at this stage - since at least some of Scotlands confirmed cases cannot be traced to travel.For now, governments at Holyrood and Westminster are steering clear of the curfews, hospitality closures, and circuit breakers that characterised the battle with Alpha.: A dramatic change from everything we have seen: Why the new Covid iant has scientists scaredVaccines may not have put an end to Covid as we wished, but immunity is still much higher than it was and boosters - not lockdown - will be the first line of defence, bolstered by surveillance and sequencing to find cases, tougher rules on travel , and  days of self-isolation for anyone identied as a close contact of someone infected with Omicron - evenfully vaccinated.Whether this will be enough depends on a lot of unknowns: its transmissibility whether and how well it can escape vaccines whether it causes more severe disease and to what extent Omicron has already spread in the UK.It also depends on us: is the public willing to \"step up\" compliance enough, or has apathy set in Whatever the answers, we will probably know them by Christmas."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13078721.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-city-centre-35m-listed-building-re-development-approved","story":"Mosaic Architecture + Designhas secured detailed permission to create office space, a business hub and ground floor retail units at  Bothwell Street.The plans will inlcude internal alterations creating a \"light-filled and activated atrium\"and the redevelopment of the fth and sixth floors within the roof to create iandscaped roof terraces.The energy-efficientl design is theresult of a collaboration between Mosaic Architecture + Design and the international design studio  Design.Those behind the project say thebuilding will be ready for occupation towards the end of .Stephen Mallon, Director of Mosaic, said: ldquoSecuring planning permission and listed building consent for  Bothwell Street within two months is a testament to good design and proper engagement with Glasgow City Council Planning Department.\"In dficult circumstances of late it is heartening to witness talented planners working hard within the council to support development and the Glasgow business community.\""},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nine-omicron-cases-far-detected-linked-single-private-event","story":"Five cases have been detected in Lanarkshire and four in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region.Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that contact tracing has established that all nine infected iniduals attended the same \"single private event\" held on Saturday November .The First Minister said: \"None of these iniduals -

Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In addition to existing disruption, there is now also signicant concern about the impact the new iant of Covid could have on schools.ldquoSchool leaders canrsquot help but remember winter term  and just how bad things got. The Government was too slow to act last year ndash it cannot repeat those same mistakes this year.He added: ldquoMore needs to be done to safeguard primary and special schools ndash at the moment they seem to be being entirely overlooked by government. And more support needs to be given to all schools to help with ventilation, testing, close contact tracing, and staff cover.The National Education Unionhas suggested face coverings could also be worn in secondary school and college classrooms in England to reduce the spread of coronavirus.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: ldquoThe autumn term was always going to be a challenge for schools and colleges, as the coronavirus continued to circulate through the community.ldquoThe new iant threatens to undo the hard work that teachers, support staff and their leaders have done to keep education going.He added: ldquoYou keep children in school by reducing the rates of Covid in schools, rates which have a highly consequential impact on families and the wider community.ldquoThe speeding up of vaccinations and boosters will certainly help, but it is clear that stronger schools guidance will make an even bigger dference in keeping case rates down.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

They start school with lower levels of numeracy skills than their peers and this gap only widens throughout their primary education.”The Covid pandemic has only made the problem worse. Early evidence of the impact of school closures indicates that the disadvantage gap in maths skills has widened throughout, that young children have been impacted the most, and maths is the subject most affected.Ulster University will be joined by Loughborough University, University of Bristol, University of Edinburgh, University of Oxford, University of York and University College London in the project.The project has been funded by a total of £m, with Ulster University’s School of Psychology receiving a share of £.m.Most ReadMichelle O’Neill shares happy photos of daughter’s weddingFather discovered bodies of his son and his friend in Coleraine tragedy, says local councillorColeraine tragedy: Shock over Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw sudden deathsBelfast man David Matchett pleads guilty to stabbing burglar Reece Leeman to deathA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadTop VideosPlayExplainer: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol PlayWho lit up Christmas in Belfast  From Bill Clinton and Holly Valance to Paw Patrol and Martine McCutcheonPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsLatest EducationDepartment reiterates its commitment to relationships and sex education reviewFuneral of Maghera principal Francis Lagan killed by falling tree during storm to take place on TuesdayPrincipal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Covid-linked staff shortages creating ‘an absolute nightmare’ for principalsLiam Neeson’s pride as Ballymena’s first integrated primary opensLatestChinese spies are targeting the UK, warns MI chiefInsulate Britain protesters stage -hour fast outside Downing StreetHealth service reform ‘must not be hampered by rows over NI Protocol’Number of unlicensed vehicles on UK roads up by , in two yearsPoliceman knew paramedics not coming to arena ‘any time soon’, inquiry hears,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

we need you and ask that you step forward to support us once again in this important expansion of the programme.“The roll-out of boosters to the entire adult population will be on a staged basis, given the JCVI recommendation and the required gap between second dose and booster.”Where to get your booster jabMost Trust vaccination hubs are offering both walk-in and booked appointments.Bookings can be made online at https:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated .A list of pharmacies offering the booster jab is available on the Health and Social Care Board website www.hscboard.hscni.net booster-covid-vaccination .Trust vaccination clinics:Ulster Hospital and Lagan Valley Hospital vaccination centres are open for walk-ins and booking appointments for boosters and first and second doses of Pfizer for all eligible age groups.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Nov   addthis, Local author Jane Buckley recently published the second of her four novels,Darkness,following the release of Stones Corner, Turmoilearlier this year. googletag.cmd.push The novels tell about the everyday realities of le in Derry and beyond from the early dark days of the Troubles in the s through to the Good Friday Peace Agreement in April . Jane said: When I look back at the launch of Stones Corner,Turmoilin February, I cant believe since then Ive completed a second novel,Darkness, and Im now working on the third,Light. Having begun to research the early s, Ill admit its been tough to find positive storylines. Ive also found it challenging, at times, to remain objective. For example, not only did I have to dig deep for good news stories, but events such as the HMS Maze hunger strikes along with the Troubles continuing to rage on was dficult. Thankfully, I came across some encouraging tales, and Ive developed them into progressive storylines. Jane said the global reception and fantastic reviews she has received for Turmoil and Darkness have been overwhelming. She added: “Readers from as far as New Zealand, the USA, Canada and even Denmark have remarked on how much theyve enjoyed the thrilling clf-hanging endings.  “Although one US reader was particularly upset when she got to the end of Turmoil without realising it was the first in a tetralogy. She was about to award me a four-star review until she got to the last chapter of Turmoil and instead sent me an email venting her frustration! I quickly contacted her and, thankfully, explained all, so much so, she gave me a five-star rating for Darkness. When Jane first completed Stones Corner, Turmoilduring lockdown, it began as a one-off project, a single novel but now its evolved into a series of four books or more formally known as a Tetralogy, a term for her which she admits she had to look up in a dictionary when one of her readers referred to it! Janes ambition was to educate the younger generation on le during the Troubles. However, she’s discovered that demo- graphically, most of her readers are women aged  upwards many of whom have remarked that through the descriptions of people and places in the books, theyve found themselves taken back in time and can closely identy with it. Marketing and promoting the novels has been a new experience for Jane. She explained: Marketing Stones Corner, Turmoil and Darkness, has been a whole new experience Ive learned so much in such a short time, some good, some bad!  “There are so many books published every year in the UK, circ.,, and an average authors sale per book is around . “Thankfully, my sales have exceeded that in just a matter of months, and with fingers and toes crossed, sales will increase over time as word of the books spread.  “Given Im an indie author, I must think out of the box when attracting readers – a continual challenge. Why would readers want to buy my book - a mere unknown  Yet they do, so I must be doing something right! Reviews are crucial to and it’s a fine line in nagging readers to leave them, but they’re critical for success. Local support for my work has proven invaluable readers are now recommending the books and knowing that they’re being read and discussed out there is satisfying beyond belief. Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol has added impetus to Janes desire to remind and encourage people to remember and learn everyday le during the Troubles.  I think its more important than ever that we dont allow the ugly head of sectarianism to rise again and threaten us with the horrors of another conflict and struggle. The Good Friday Agreement is still on thin ice and must be treated with care and common sense and clear thinking. You cant tell me theres anyone in this amazing country of ours would want to face conflict again  It would be a catastrophe for all of us. Jane has also received support from local authors, and in the process of introducing her work, investigated the opportunity of holding a Walled City Literature Festival in the city. She said: I was stunned at the amount and quality of Northern Irish based writers but couldnt see a local literature  for us to share and show off our work. As such, I spent a great deal of time putting a plan together for a three-day Derry-based festival over a weekend. Sadly, it didnt take happen because of a lack of funding. Maybe one day!  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, People Before Profit councillor, Shaun Harkin, has demanded that Prime-Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary, Priti Patel, be put up at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for their policies on immigration. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin was speaking at the United Against Racism rally last Sunday next to the backdrop of Derrys Emigration Statues at Queens Quay that symbolise the citys own refugees who had to flee the starvation and persecution of An Gorta Moacuter in the s. Drawing parallels with those that sought refuge around the world from Ireland back then, Cllr Harkin said the  refugees who died trying to cross the English Channel last week need not have done so. Citing the British Governments immigration policies, Cllr Harkin said Mr Johnson and Ms Patel should be held accountable at the highest level for creating a culture in Britain that demonised migrants and asylum seekers. He said: “Its fitting we are gathered by the Great Hunger statues. One million people died across Ireland through starvation and disease. “They didnt need to die but did because the British government decided profits for a tiny handful of very wealthy people was more important than saving hundreds of thousands of lives. “More than one million people fled Ireland in a short number of years. They traveled by whatever means they could in complete desperation and were not welcomed with open arms wherever they arrived. “They were described as famine Irish who were swarming across seas bringing backwardness, disease and poverty. Today, we see millions of people fleeing starvation, war, crushing poverty and climate change. Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced. “People from Iraq and Afghanistan are almost always included among those fleeing and among those drowning. “Both countries were brought to ruin by US and British government disastrous wars and occupations that succeeded in killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people and stuffing billions in blood profits into the bank account of arms manufacturers. “In  the toddler Alan Kurdi washed up on Greek beach. The world responded with grief, with outrage and demanded action. Nothing has changed. “Boris Johnson and Priti Patel should be going to the International Criminal Court for their racist immigration policies, for their efforts to demonise migrants and asylum seekers, for their role in the death of innocent people at sea, in trucks, in freezing camps.” Cllr Harkins ire was also directed at the European Union who he accused as being equally culpable as Mr Johnson and Ms Patel. He added: “Were told over and over how progressive EU bureaucrats are. Its a myth. “Twenty seven people died in the English channel last week but nearly  people have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year already. “Nearly , have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea since . This is the direct result of racist EU immigration policies. “EU bosses are spending tens of billions to strengthen Fortress Europe with surveillance, patrols and  kilometres of border walls. “Nothing has changed because the British government and EU bureaucrats prioritise upholding racist borders and the wealth of a handful of billionaires over taking real humanitarian action. “The British government and EU elites will never put humanity before billionaires, powerful corporations and war profiteers. “James Connolly, a migrant himself, opposed a border in Ireland but also opposed borders across Europe. He continues to speak for a vision directly opposed to that of elites and billionaires: “The day will come, and perhaps like a bolt from the blue, when the frontiers will not be sufficient to prevent the handclasp of friendship between the peoples. “But that day will come only when the kings and kaisers, queens and czars, financiers and capitalists who now oppress humanity will be hurled from their place and power. “And the emancipated workers of the earth, no longer the blind instruments of rich men’s greed will found a new society, a new civilisation, whose corner stone will be labour, whose inspiring principle will be justice, whose limits humanity alone can bound. “If we want to end English Channel and Mediterranean Sea drowning tragedies this is what we need to aspire to do.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

She said: “The announcement that the booster vaccine programme has been extended to include younger people is very welcome. “The COVID booster vaccination has been shown to be highly effective at preventing serious illness and the spread of the virus. “It is also notable that the gap between the second and third dose is to be cut to three months in an effort to stymie the further spread of COVID-. “While these measures are welcome it must be remembered that vaccines are but one tool in the kit. “It is vital that the Department of Health have an optimal level of testing and tracing in constant operation and that we all observe public health advice on hygiene and mask wearing. “Together all these tools can work to keep us safe and to reduce the pressures being endured by our health and social care workers.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.  BEST MOMENT OF THE SEASON BEATING DUNDALK AT LAST It might not have been the greatest game, but the victory over Dundalk on August  was long, long, long overdue. Derry City had suffered against the Lilywhites for close to a decade, and any type of win was needed just to get that monkey off our backs. It came as a result of a Jamie McGonigle penalty, and also gave Derry a win over one of the so-called big teams in quite a while. It was the first Brandywell victory over Dundalk since October, , when a Derry City team which included Ruaidhri Higgins won -. That win gave City some real belief and they followed that up with their first win at Oriel Park since  by winning - on the final day of the season to secure fourth place.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.  BEST MOMENT OF THE SEASON BEATING DUNDALK AT LAST It might not have been the greatest game, but the victory over Dundalk on August  was long, long, long overdue. Derry City had suffered against the Lilywhites for close to a decade, and any type of win was needed just to get that monkey off our backs. It came as a result of a Jamie McGonigle penalty, and also gave Derry a win over one of the so-called big teams in quite a while. It was the first Brandywell victory over Dundalk since October, , when a Derry City team which included Ruaidhri Higgins won -. That win gave City some real belief and they followed that up with their first win at Oriel Park since  by winning - on the final day of the season to secure fourth place.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

This in invaluable and has almost certainly improved the mental wellbeing for those people involved.ldquoWe rely heavily on fund raising and contributions, and this donation from Power NI through the Helping Hands scheme is most valuable as we come out of lockdown..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Additional parking plan for Newcastle  ","story":"A PLAN to develop a major extension to Donard Park car park in Newcastle has been approved by planners.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is investing pound, to formally develop a grass overspill area at the foothills of the Mournes to provide  new spaces.Local planners gave the scheme the green light at their monthly meeting last week, with the extended car park featuring  dedicated spaces for drivers with mobility issues.As part of the development proposal on land west of the existing car park, a six metre high ball stop fence is being erected and a . metre high paladin fence.There will also be a number of new footpaths, new lighting, landscaping and drainage.None of the statutory agencies have objected to the local authority proposal, but concern was expressed by one resident about the anti-social behaviour of young drivers using the car park.Recommending that the council proposal should be approved, planners said the current overspill car park is considered to be site a ldquosufficient distance from adjacent dwellings to prevent ldquoany unacceptable impacts.Planners say taking into account planning policy, consultee responses, planning history and responses, approval is recommended subject to a positive response from the Natural Environment Division which is currently outstanding.Planners have also stipulated that prior to any work starting, a final drainage assessment, including a detailed drainage network design and demonstration of how so-called out-of-sewer flooding will be addressed, must be agreed with them.No retained trees will be allowed to be felled or uprooted as part of the work to provide the new parking spaces.Planners have also warned that care will need to be taken during the construction phase to ensure there are no polluting discharges.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke are both pleased that formal planning approval for the car park extension has been granted.Cllr Mason said she was delighted to see what she described as ldquosignicant investment in Newcastle to provide much-needed car parking for residents and visitors.ldquoThere has been considerable increase in so-called staycations and users of the outdoors and this investment will help alleviate the pressure on parking in the resort, she added.Cllr Clarke said the current overflow car park behind the football pitch at Donard Park was ldquounsightly and dficult to manage in wet weather.He continued: ldquoThe new car park will provide much-needed spaces at the foot of the Mournes.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is investing a signicant amount of money to replace the overspill park with a larger, more attractive one that will better serve the southern part of town that is seeing signicant regeneration and development.Cllr Clarke said the design of the new park took into account the need for improved environmentally friendly provisions such as electric car charging points, solar powered lighting and improved landscaping.He added: ldquoAlthough not required for planning, it is anticipated that improved picnic areas and potential for a sensory garden can also be incorporated at a later date. It is essential that we get security and management of car parking right at this popular location..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Annahilt A overcome Bright side  ","story":"IN the Senior Section of the East Down Churches League Annahilt A were good - winners over Bright and Banbridge A saw off their B team by the same score.The only game to go to five sets in the Annahilt and Bright match was the second singles when Kyle Graham put up an excellent display to better Victor Edgar -, -, -, -, -.In his second game Kyle was an -, -, - winner over Adrian Brown.Geoffrey Beattie had to work hard in his game with James Ferguson, but got home -, -, -, -.The big surprise of the night came when Beattie faced Arnold Ennis.

We wish both loyal players well.Annahilt C moved to the top of the Intermediate Section with a hard fought - victory over Banbridge D.Mervyn Cairns in the top two singles games was too experienced for Maya Forsythe and Katherine McConnell, while Jack Shaw kept up his winning run with good wins over Anna and Trevor Russell.James Cairns also added two more wins to his CV.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Booster vaccination can now be given from three months of completion of the primary course.Welcoming the expansion, Mr. Swann said: ldquoOur booster programme will now in many ways mirror the primary dose vaccination programme which steadily moved its way down through the dferent age groups over a number of months.ldquoI would again urge people not to be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due to concerns or speculation about the Omicron iant.ldquoIt remains very likely that vaccination will continue to protect against severe illness from Omicron as it does against other iants of SARS-CoV-.ldquoIn addition, our vaccines provide very good protection against the Delta iant, which remains the predominant strain in Northern Ireland at this point.The Minister revealed details of Health Trust vaccination hubs and clinics that are opening this week across Northern Ireland, complementing the ongoing vaccination work of GPs and local pharmacies, signicantly increasing the systemrsquos capacity to deliver boosters.In addition, the pharmacy sector is finalising plans for a special weekend of additional walk-in booster vaccination clinics this Saturday and Sunday .In the first instance, most Trust vaccination hubs and clinics will principally focus on boosters for the over-s.Anyone in this category should be called by their GP but can also attend Community Pharmacy or Trust Centresthey have not yet received their booster.Trust centres are also providing ongoing first- and second-doses for all eligible age groups and will open soon to the - year olds for their booster doses.People in the -plus age range now have a choice of waiting to be invited in by their GP for their booster, or going to a local pharmacy or the Trust Centres.The ision of roles between the vaccine providers will be kept under ongoing review and is likely to be updated in the coming weeks.Most Trust vaccination hubs are offering both walk-in and booked appointments.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Her comments last Tuesdaydrew criticism from unionists. “It is not my job be a persuader for the Union,” she said.Ms Haigh also said that an important principle that led up to the Belfast Agreement was that “Britain should not have any strategic or selfish economic interest in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland”.Sir Keir carried out a wide-ranging rearrangement of his top team, in which Yvette Cooper s to Labour’s frontbench. Ms Cooper, a former cabinet minister and the current chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, becomes shadow home secretary and will take on Priti Patel over the migrant crisis.Sir Keir also handed big promotions to two of Labour’s rising stars, Bridget Phillipson and Wes Streeting, who take on the roles of shadow education secretary and shadow health secretary.Jonathan Ashworth, who has had the health brief through the pandemic, is moved to shadow work and pensions secretary.In other moves, Lisa Nandy will face off against Michael Gove as shadow secretary for levelling up and communities. She will be replaced as shadow foreign secretary by David Lammy.Former leader Ed Miliband becomes shadow climate change secretary, while Jonathan Reynolds takes on his former portfolio of business, energy and industrial strategy.“With this reshuffle we are a smaller, more focused shadow cabinet that mirrors the shape of the Government we are shadowing,” he said.“We must hold the Conservative Government to account on behalf of the public and demonstrate that we are the right choice to form the next government.”Earlier it appeared the reshuffle would be overshadowed as tensions resurfaced between Sir Keir and his deputy, Angela Rayner.Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided when news of the reshuffle broke, as she was delivering a keynote speech on Labour’s plans for reforming standards in public le.“I don’t know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it,” she said in response to reporters’ questions.“I’ve been here concentrating on my role now, but six months ago I said again, we need some consistency in how we’re approaching things as an opposition.”A spokesman for Ms Rayner later said the leader and his deputy had spoken between her morning round of media interviews and her speech at the Institute for Government .Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was shadow home secretary, takes on international trade in what is ostensibly a demotion.However Sir Keir softened the blow by announcing that he had asked him to head a new shadow cabinet committee leading the party’s response on Brexit.Elsewhere, Lucy Powell becomes shadow culture secretary, Jim McMahon gets environment and Steve Reed goes to justice.The veteran former minister Pat McFadden becomes shadow treasury chief secretary while former leadership contender Emily Thornberry is the shadow attorney general. Jo Stevens becomes shadow Welsh secretary.Those leaving include the former shadow education secretary Kate Green, the former shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard and the Blair-era veteran Lord Falconer, who announced he was stepping down as shadow attorney general.Earlier, Cat Smith, who was shadow minister for young people and one of the last acolytes of Jeremy Corbyn on the Labour frontbench, announced she was quitting, citing the continued withholding of the Labour whip from the former leader.“This position is utterly unsustainable and it is important that you truly understand how much damage this is causing in constituency Labour parties and amongst ordinary members, a number of whom are no longer campaigning.” she wrote in her letter of resignation.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, party chair Anneliese Dodds and shadow defence secretary John Healey are among those remaining in their current posts.In a statement, Sir Keir said: “I want to thank all those who have left the shadow cabinet today for their great service to me and to our party.“I look forward to working with the new team to show we are once again a serious party of Government, ready to fix the mess the Tories have got the country into and to inspire voters to believe that Britain’s best days are ahead of us.”Labour Party Northern Ireland spokeswoman under fire for saying she would not argue for NI’s place in the UK in a border pollPeter Hain backs Louise Haigh over position on NI’s status——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The Government was too slow to act last year ndash it cannot repeat those same mistakes this year.He added: ldquoMore needs to be done to safeguard primary and special schools ndash at the moment they seem to be being entirely overlooked by government. And more support needs to be given to all schools to help with ventilation, testing, close contact tracing, and staff cover.The National Education Unionhas suggested face coverings could also be worn in secondary school and college classrooms in England to reduce the spread of coronavirus.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: ldquoThe autumn term was always going to be a challenge for schools and colleges, as the coronavirus continued to circulate through the community.ldquoThe new iant threatens to undo the hard work that teachers, support staff and their leaders have done to keep education going.He added: ldquoYou keep children in school by reducing the rates of Covid in schools, rates which have a highly consequential impact on families and the wider community.ldquoThe speeding up of vaccinations and boosters will certainly help, but it is clear that stronger schools guidance will make an even bigger dference in keeping case rates down.

That’s the appeal to the public from Health Minister Robin Swann, as public health measures are activated in response to the Omicron iant’s emergence. Mr Swann also underlined the continuing importance of vaccination in the battle against all strains of the virus. “Subject to the Speaker’s approval, I intend to update the Assembly on Monday in regard to the measures being deployed in response to the emergence of the Omicron iant,” the Minister said. “These include the addition of a number of countries to Northern Ireland’s Red List for international travel. “The emerging picture on the Omicron iant is being very closely monitored and we will continue to liaise with public health colleagues in the other UK jurisdictions and the Irish Republic.” The Minister urged everyone to adhere to the basic steps that will help stop the spread of all iants of COVID-. These include: getting vaccinated and getting your booster dose when eligible, wearing a face covering, limiting contacts, keeping rooms well-ventilated or meeting outdoors when possible, working from homepossible, and practising good hand hygiene. If you have symptoms of COVID- – a high temperature OR a new, continuous cough OR a loss of or change in sense of smell, or taste, no matter how mild – please isolate and get a PCR test as soon as possible. The Health Minister continued: “There are concerns that the Omicron iant may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines. That is not confirmed and it is important to emphasise that. “Furthermore, eventhis does turn out to be the case, it remains vital that as many people as possible get their first and second doses and their booster vaccines when eligible. “I have been assured that our vaccines should still provide a level of protection against Omicron. The importance of that cannot be overestimated. Secondly, we know that our vaccines are very effective against the Delta iant. Delta very much remains the predominant iant in NI at the current time, is a very real and present risk to our population, and is continuing to cause serious illness and, in some tragic cases, death to our fellow citizens.” Mr Swann continued: “Plans have been activated to identy any spread of the new iant in NI. “Using passenger locator data, the Public Health Agency is identying and contacting iniduals who have recently arrived in Northern Ireland from Red List countries. “They and their household members will be asked to self-isolate and undertake PCR tests. If any positive cases are detected, the sample will then undergo Whole Genome Sequencingto determine the iant type. If the new iant is confirmed here, all appropriate health protection actions will be carried out and the public will be informed as appropriate.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edcbcefeafecfddeae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdbbedeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638199683305.jpg--covid_19___mon_29th_november_figures.jpg?163819968300","title":"covid  mon th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The new restrictions come into force after the Omicron iant was found to be in both England and Scotland. From Tuesday, anyone arriving into Northern Ireland from non-red list countries , including those who are fully vaccinated, will now be required to self-isolate and take a PCR test before the end of day two. All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status, amid concerns existing jabs will be less effective against the strain that is believed to spread rapidly.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bedbbbdfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fabedfcdfddbbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
