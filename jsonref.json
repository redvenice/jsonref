In between them is an easement which they say is theirs and which grants him access to his deckShare this articleThey say that since a judge sided with them in their complaint that he did not have the proper permits for the deck, Radnor has been making their lives difficult. They allege in court documents obtained by DailyMail.com that he not only shouts at them whenever they go outside but that he also makes workers in their yard \u0027uncomfortable\u0027. Radnor\u0027s representatives did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com\u0027s inquiries on Friday morning. The dispute began in May 2017 after Radnor built the expansive deck.           Radnor and his neighbors have been in dispute since 2017. He bought his home for $1.1million in 2007          One of the neighbors\u0027 complaints is that Radnor appears on his deck shirtless and yells at them According to court records, the prior owner of his home acquired the right to expand the yard into the neighbor\u0027s land but only if they kept a walkway and a wall that were there. In 2016, Radnor built his deck but demolished the wall, according to his neighbors.He claims in court records that they have since climbed over a fence to sit on the deck without his permission, something he says is \u0027distressing\u0027. He wanted his own restraining order to apply to them.Their lawyers claim that because the deck is on their land, they have a right to occupy it.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/21/4BB52CED00000578-6096059-image-m-52_1535143684396.jpg","title":"Sarah Palin says John McCain remembered American hero","story":"    In an exclusive interview with DailyMail TV, Palin, 54, and her husband Todd, 53, reflected on her time as McCain\u0027s running mate during the 2008 presidential election          Game changer: Sarah Palin gave John McCain\u0027s campaign an enormous boost when she first joined as his vice presidential running mate in 2008\u0027I don\u0027t think inherently he necessarily was really connected, so he did rely on people telling him - in polls - telling him and…he went from there. \u0027I think that\u0027s unfortunate because he had some strange people around him and..disloyal people, and you know, I don\u0027t say that as like hate speech or griping about it, it\u0027s just a fact they were just some not nice people.\u0027 Todd added: \u0027But when she was doing debate prep for a big debate with Biden or just wanted to talk about some issue, she could have like four or five people around her with all the cue cards and all this and sit there for hours and not accomplish much. \u0027But sit in the back of the bus with John and her and it was awesome to watch. So, I just respected John and he had a huge heart you know.\u0027  Sarah said McCain had agreed with her about not letting other people \u0027mold you into something you\u0027re not.\u0027\u0027You can\u0027t do that. You can\u0027t be insincere and not genuine and accomplish what needs to be done, but yeah, that was a huge lesson,\u0027 she said.  \u0027If it was just John McCain and me, or just our families together it was awesome. Those were the good times. \u0027When asked on what she believed was McCain\u0027s political legacy, she said the senator will be remembered in high respects for his military service. \u0027The unfortunate part about it will be that I think some of the people around him- still try to undermine us.          McCain and Cindy had four children together - Meghan (center), Jack and James, in addition to adopting a daughter, Bridget, from Bangladesh  The senator has been battling cancer for the past year and relocated indefinitely to his home in Arizona last December. He is pictured right with his daughter Meghan  \u0027Part of that legacy unfortunately will be some of these people that had influence on him will, unfortunately, they really took advantage of, and that wasn\u0027t good. The former governor and her husband also spoke out against claims that McCain had regretted picking her as his running mate.The 81-year-old revealed in his memoir, The Restless Wave, published in April, that he wished he had chosen Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman as his VP instead.In an earlier interview with DailyMailTV in May, Palin had said she attributed his statements to \u0027his ghostwriters.\u0027\u0027I was reading part of his book and he had nothing but praise her. He had one little sentence where he was saying maybe I should have picked Joe,\u0027 Todd said. \u0027Four-five little words. He praised her and how he selected her, but that\u0027s how it works…that\u0027s how the perception in the media works.\u0027 Sarah reiterated that McCain had never told her those sentiments himself. \u0027Well, with that headline though that he evidently regretted picking me, well my thought was, well he\u0027s never said that to me.\u0027We\u0027ve always had great conversations and thankfulness that I accepted the opportunity, and was given the opportunity. It\u0027s all been good.           Then Republican presidential candidate John McCain (C) greets family members of his running mate, vice presidential candidate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, upon his arrival to attend the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis in 2008\u0027I had never heard that from him before and…it\u0027s a shame to live life with regrets especially like that, that would be a huge regret. That\u0027s life-changing, nation-changing regret. Let it be a lesson that we not live life with regrets.\u0027 The two had kept in touch over the years after their failed campaign despite their differences, Palin said. \u0027We\u0027ve always had great conversations- and we\u0027ve been able to agree to disagree, certainly on political issues.John McCain, 81, halts his medical care: Senator\u0027s daughter...Melania to leave her mark on the White House grounds by...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/01/4F5FB25500000578-6096279-image-a-62_1535157745799.jpg","title":"Corbyn defends Zionists comment Tories report standards watchdog","story":"Mike Gapes, a former chairman of the foreign affairs committee (right), has slammed Jeremy Corbyn over a video of him making controversial comments in 2013 (still from video on left)The Conservatives have reported Mr Corbyn to the parliamentary standards watchdog over a video of him at the Palestinian Return Centre in 2013.Speaking at the London conference  promoted by the propaganda website of terror group Hamas, he said British Zionists did not \u0027understand English irony\u0027.Mr Gapes, who has previously been targeted by online trolls after he suffered a heart attack, told fellow MPs: \u0027I am not prepared to support the racist antisemite.

This afternoon he met Ireland\u0027s first gay prime minister.Tens of thousands gathered in Dublin as he passed through in his Popemobile, a Skoda Rapid model, waving and smiling to the crowds on Dame Street.

I myself share those sentiments.\u0027 \u0027It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole,\u0027 he said. He also praised his predecessor, Benedict XVI, for tackling the issue, saying: \u0027His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the church\u0027s leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again.\u0027 Mr Varadkar said he hoped the papal visit would mark a \u0027new chapter\u0027 in Ireland\u0027s relationship with the Catholic Church.In his speech to the pope at Dublin Castle, he said both church and state had a history of \u0027sorrow and shame,\u0027 and he urged the pope to ensure that victims of sex abuse find \u0027justice and truth and healing\u0027.Varadkar cited the recent Pennsylvania grand jury report, which found 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses, in urging Francis to \u0027ensure that from words flow actions\u0027.Pope to pray before relics of Ireland\u0027s \u0027holy drinker\u0027 Matt...British tourists are hunted by Italian police after...A third of families in Ireland no longer fit the Catholic...Share this article\u0027In recent weeks, we have all listened to heart-breaking stories from Pennsylvania of brutal crimes perpetrated by people within the Catholic Church, and then obscured to protect the institution at the expense of innocent victims,\u0027 Varadkar said. \u0027It\u0027s a story all too tragically familiar here in Ireland.\u0027The taoiseach added: \u0027The Ireland of the 21st century is a very different place today than it was in the past. Ireland is increasingly erse.  \u0027One in six of us were not born here and there are more and more people who adhere to other faiths, or who are comfortable in declaring that they subscribe to no organised religion.\u0027We have voted in our parliament and by referendum to modernise our laws – understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents or parents who are orced.\u0027He added: \u0027Holy Father, I believe that the time has now come for us to build a new relationship between church and state in Ireland – a new covenant for the 21st century. It is my hope that your visit marks the opening of a new chapter in the relationship between Ireland and the Catholic Church.\u0027Building on our intertwined history, and learning from our shared mistakes, it can be one in which religion is no longer at the centre of our society, but in which it still has an important place.\u0027            The Popemobile and its convoy drive through the streets of Dublin today greeted by cheering crowds of well-wishers           Pope Francis waves to the faithful on his popemobile in Dublin where thousands of people greeted the 81-year-old pontiff          Pope Francis greets the public as he travels through the city in the Popemobile, a converted Skoda Rapid, on Saturday          Pope Francis waves to admirers as his Popemobile carries the 81-year-old pontiff through the streets of Dublin today           The Pope puts his hand to his head before he speaks alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at St Patrick\u0027s Hall in Dublin today           Pope Francis, centre, is flanked by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, right, as they arrive to make speeches in Dublin today    Pope Francis meets with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle where they spoke about historical sex abuse     Pope Francis meets the President of Ireland Michael D.

Just before midnight on Saturday, as the liner rounded the northern coast of Croatia, she disappeared overboard, plunging 75ft from the seventh deck into the sea – and hitting the water with such force that she injured her right cheek.Yet this was to be a story with a happy – many would say miraculous – ending. When hope was all but lost after ten long hours, Miss Longstaff, on the cusp of giving up, was spotted and plucked to safety. Hollywood could not have scripted it better.This much is not in dispute. It was whether she jumped or accidentally fell (foul play was quickly ruled out) that became the subject of international intrigue.Today, after a week of claim and counter-claim, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that investigators in both Croatia and Italy – where the Norwegian Star was bound – have completed their inquiries and concluded that Miss Longstaff, an air stewardess, did indeed jump.They found that she did so \u0027voluntarily\u0027 – and in a \u0027determined\u0027 fashion. Yet the mystery of what prompted her drastic action remains, as do a number of unanswered questions.Her father has suggested that she had recently \u0027been going through a very hard time\u0027. Inevitably some will conclude, therefore, that this was a cry for help – or worse.          \u0027Kay from England\u0027 is escorted by rescuers from a Croatian Coast Guard vessel in Pula port last weekend Perhaps the row with her partner played a part. Perhaps she was blind drunk – they\u0027d been drinking all day after all – and didn\u0027t know what she was doing. And maybe she simply can\u0027t remember.So far all that she has said is that she \u0027fell off the back\u0027 of the liner. For now, Miss Longstaff does not seem minded to enlighten anyone further. Save for her balcony appearances, she has been holed up inside her apartment near the city of Malaga for most of the week, refusing to come to the door – quite possibly determined to put her embarrassing moment in the spotlight behind her.She will be gratified to learn that she will not have to contribute towards the cost of her rescue, which involved an aircraft and three patrolling vessels. The bill is thought to run to several hundred thousand pounds.Croatia\u0027s Ministry of Maritime Affairs said \u0027international agreements\u0027 prevent Croatia from forcing the woman to pay up.Tellingly, perhaps, this was a great concern of Miss Longstaff. Minutes after the rescue, she asked directly whether she would have to foot the bill. \u0027Where will I find the money for that?\u0027 she asked Lovro Oreskovic, captain of the Cavtat, one of the patrol boats.Mr Oreskovic said: \u0027It was one of the first things she asked us. We assured her that she would have nothing to pay.\u0027Lawyer Mark Lee, a travel litigation specialist, said passengers who missed flights because of the rescue would have to rely on their own travel insurance. And he said: \u0027I think it\u0027s unlikely that anyone could successfully recover damages from the lady who jumped – and even if they did, she is unlikely to have sufficient funds to satisfy any awards against her.\u0027          Pictured is the Golf Beach 3 Benalmadena apartment block where Kay Longstaff and Craig Rayment liveNone of Miss Longstaff\u0027s family members are prepared to speak about what happened, though her father called her a heroine and said he could not \u0027imagine her jumping\u0027.Others disagreed. One crew member suggested she leapt after scaling railings on the edge of the deck. The mother of the liner company boss called her a \u0027stupid woman\u0027 and insisted she jumped. CCTV footage apparently appeared to support this version. But on Friday, the mystery took another turn with a report that part of the wooden handrail around the ship was missing. Could she have fallen, after all?A source involved in the investigation told The Mail on Sunday: \u0027The CCTV footage shows that she was on the seventh deck of Norwegian Star when she put her bag with belongings on a table. She started to take off her clothes. She did not seem nervous. If anything, it looked rather routine. She stopped for a few moments and then jumped in a very determined way – preventing her hitting the ship or getting sucked in by an engine.\u0027It is not clear when the alarm was first raised but at some point the liner doubled back to look for her. The search and rescue operation was launched at 2.17am on Sunday after the captain filed a missing person report.          Kay Longstaff (pictured in a red dress) is seen hugging a friend in her hotel in Venice where she stayed last week          Kay Longstaff had job with private jet operator NetJets, she looked after high profile celebritiesMiss Longstaff, meanwhile, survived by floating on her back – and singing. Her fitness from yoga helped and the water, lit by a half moon, was unusually warm.Further details of her rescue emerged yesterday. It has been reported that because she wasn\u0027t wearing a lifejacket, she was missed by circling aircraft.On Sunday morning, numerous passing vessels also missed her. By then her voice had become strained. \u0027She was waving and trying to shout, but her voice was lost as she was obviously using it during the night,\u0027 said a member of the rescue team.Miss Longstaff was finally located at 9.40am on Sunday less than a mile from where she disappeared.\u0027She said she didn\u0027t have the strength to keep floating for much longer,\u0027 said Mr Oreskovic. \u0027She first took some water, then had soup. We also gave her an isotonic drink and finally a pudding before she fell asleep.\u0027Two police investigations were launched. In Venice, where the liner eventually docked many hours behind schedule, prosecutor Roberto Terzo oversaw a cursory inquiry.

It is thought she will return to work this week.          Kay Longstaff jumped 75ft from the seventh deck into sea - injuring her cheek as she hit waterShe had long harboured an ambition to live abroad and moved to Spain after tiring of the British climate, getting a job with private jet operator NetJets. Former Premier League footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger, Formula 1 racing drivers and socialite Tamara Ecclestone are said to have been among the clients she looked after.Miss Longstaff and her partner returned home to Torrequebrada on Tuesday– she spent Sunday and Monday night under observation in hospital in Pula, where doctors assessed her psychiatric condition. They then travelled to Venice where she spoke to Italian police, and was seen returning to her hotel with Mr Rayment after dinner.She was later spirited through Malaga airport by police. Since then she has kept a low profile.But by Friday afternoon, the couple seemed in the mood to relax and were spotted sunbathing on their terrace.Miss Longstaff, wearing a pink bikini top and sunglasses and with her blonde hair tied back, sipped from an outsized teacup.One neighbour said of the couple: \u0027They are very nice people. Kay is a beautiful English lady and always says \u0027Hello\u0027. They are never any trouble.\u0027Meanwhile, a friend suggested Miss Longstaff was \u0027desperately upset\u0027 about disrupting the travel plans of other Norwegian Star passengers. The friend said: \u0027She is clearly very embarrassed about what happened.\u0027I think it is pretty obvious that there was a bit of alcohol involved and she was not thinking straight.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/22/4F652BEC00000578-0-image-m-202_1535231797438.jpg","title":"Labour members questioned loyalty British Jews investigated","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn pictured this month in EdinburghLabour members who questioned the loyalty of British Jews have been investigated as part of Labour Party internal inquiries into anti-Semitism, it was claimed last night.A former Labour investigations officer sought to lift the lid on the nature of anti-Semitism allegations within the party.Dan Hogan, who quit his party post earlier, added that he had also carried out disciplinary inquiries into party members who ‘promoted Holocaust deniers’ and praised terrorists. The revelations came as the relative of a teenager killed in a terror attack spoke of his horror that Jeremy Corbyn had once met a Hamas chief linked to the murder.Adam Ma’anit accused Labour of sinking ‘into an anti-Semitic cesspit of its own making’.In a tweet last week, Dan Hogan, who worked on Labour’s internal disciplinary inquiries, stunned MPs by revealing the nature and scale of allegations investigated. John Lennon’s half-sister reveals how he used to jam in the...Share this articleMr Hogan said: ‘I’ve done plenty of disciplinary cases against Labour members who compared Israel to the Nazis, peddled conspiracy theories about Israel, promoted Holocaust deniers, praised terrorists, and who questioned the Britishness or loyalty of British Jews.’His remarks came amid private claims from MPs that the party does not have enough staff to handle all the anti-Semitic allegations coming in.

No one was shocked that he’s a serial philanderer, we all knew that, but it was the volume of damaging stories against him that was staggering. We had Trump nailed.’Indeed, The Mail on Sunday has learned that the files contained alleged details of:l At least a dozen affairs and pay-offs – some for acts of sexual misconduct – to women including models and Playboy playmatesl A $30,000 payment to ‘Dino the doorman’, a member of Trump’s staff, who claimed he knew about one of the affairs          Donald Trump with Stormy Daniels in 2006l So-called ‘catch and kill’ projects which allowed the tabloids to seek favours from celebrities including an unnamed British star, Tiger Woods and Arnold Schwarzenegger in return for burying potentially damaging allegations about them.For many years the brash deliverer of scoops, The Enquirer last week found itself making, rather than breaking, the news.Mr Howard and David Pecker, chairman of American Media Inc, the owner of The Enquirer, were both granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for information related to ‘hush money’ payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal by AMI and Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Both women claim to have had affairs with Trump – which he denies – and were both allegedly paid for their silence in the run-up to the 2016 US elections.Trump has always vehemently denied all allegations of affairs and sexual misconduct leveled against him, dismissing the claims as ‘fake news’ and ‘lies’ spread by those seeking to discredit him.In the case of McDougal, it is claimed that The Enquirer executed a ‘catch and kill’, whereby it paid money for her story without having any intention of publishing it in order to protect Trump.Federal prosecutors are now examining whether Trump violated any of America’s strict campaign finance laws by approving the catch and kill payments to his alleged mistresses.          IMMUNITY: David Pecker, chairman of AMI, which owns The National Enquirer, with two Playboy bunniesThe involvement of The Enquirer emerged during a dramatic week in which Trump’s former lawyer Cohen – who arranged payments of $130,000 to Daniels and $150,000 to McDougal – pleaded guilty to eight charges, including campaign finance violations.In a clear reference to Trump, Cohen said he had been directed to break federal election laws by ‘a candidate for federal office’.In a further blow to the President, his former campaign manager Paul Manafort was last week found guilty of tax evasion and bank fraud.And Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump organisation, who is said to hold the key to the businessman’s financial and tax affairs, was also offered immunity from prosecution in return for cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.Oscar-winner Kate Winslet to welcome movie cameras into her...Tommy Robinson is seen for the first time since his release...\u0027You can never take away her superpowers\u0027: Nike defends...Labour members who questioned the loyalty of British Jews...Share this articleIt is Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election that triggered what former Enquirer bureau chief Jerry George called: ‘The implosion of the Trump presidency.’Mr George, who worked for The Enquirer for 28 years, claimed: ‘Trump’s history of philandering was legendary.‘In the days before David Pecker took over in 1999, Trump would get caught out having affairs... but he would trade stories with us, saying, “If you don’t run this about me, I can give you this story about one of my rich friends.”‘He always had a certain type – porn stars, Playmates, beauty queens. Sometimes we worked with him, sometimes we didn’t.‘He would ring up and offer stories on his celebrity friends and business associates in exchange for us killing negative stories about his philandering. All the files were stored in the Lantana warehouse, with contacts written down on paper the old-fashioned way – source notes, original copies of contracts and pay-offs if they were made.‘Trump should be very worried about those files.‘The Enquirer ended up becoming Trump’s private mouthpiece. The irony is The Enquirer could end up bringing him down.’    Close Friends: Trump with David Pecker in 2004. David Pecker, chairman of American Media Inc, the owner of The Enquirer, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for information related to ‘hush money’ payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal by AMI and Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen‘With Trump, there was a history of catch and kill – at least a dozen women over the years were paid off.’ The Enquirer has not commented on the fresh claims but has previously insisted that stories were published solely on editorial judgment.It also emerged this weekend that Dino Sajudin – a former doorman at Trump World Tower in New York – was paid $30,000 by The Enquirer after approaching the tabloid with a ‘rumour’ about Trump’s sex life.While the claim is false, Sajudin passed a lie detector test arranged by The Enquirer, which proved he believed it to be true.‘He was paid thirty grand for a story that wasn’t true. That was pretty good going,’ said Mr George.On Friday night, Trump was in Ohio. Unbowed by the swirl of scandal, he told adoring supporters: ‘We won the election. We’re going to win again in 2020.’The fate of the cache of ‘Trump files’ remains unknown. They were moved from Lantana to a safe in The Enquirer’s New York office, but a source told The Mail on Sunday that they are no longer there, having been collected the week before Trump’s inauguration.‘They have been moved,’ the source added. ‘They may be in the hands of Robert Mueller. They may still be in Pecker’s possession. They may even have been shredded.’For the sake of Trump’s presidency and legacy, he must surely be hoping the latter is true."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/08/4F68318D00000578-6098823-image-a-3_1535270176715.jpg","title":"Moment Liam Gallagher grabs girlfriend Debbie Gwyther throat London club","story":"    In a video posted by the Sun, Liam Gallagher appears to grab his girlfriend Debbie Gwyther, 36, by the throat in a row at the Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone on August 8          Liam appears to push Debbie through the doorway and she stumbles backwards.

The project was conceptualised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.It is intended to \u0027remind every inidual of our great nation\u0027s freedom struggle\u0027 and to \u0027inspire the people of our country to inculcate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\u0027s visionary ideologies of unity, patriotism, inclusive growth and good governance,\u0027 the Statue of Unity website reads. \u0027This monument will not just be a mute memorial like the rest, but a fully functional, purpose-serving tribute that will spur all round socio-economic development, in the form of better connectivity, healthcare and education infrastructure, research centre for agriculture development and various tribal development initiatives.\u0027 However, many have criticised the project for being a waste of money and some political parties have argued the expenditure for the statue should have gone towards other priorities like women\u0027s safety, education and agricultural schemes. Vishal Shah wrote on YouTube in response to a promotional video: \u0027This is ridiculous project, what would we achieve from it?\u0027 While Surya Vanka mused: \u0027Besides being an enormous waste of resources, this is a rather tasteless and gaudy project.\u0027Others feel the project is an important reminder of the nation\u0027s past when Patel united the 565 semi-autonomous states and British-era colonial provinces to form a united India.Patel led the Indian National Congress which forged the Indian movement for independence, following World War II when the party put pressure on the British government to pass an independence bill in July 1947.The party declared that India would not support the war until it had been granted complete independence.In January 1950 India’s constitution as an independent state took effect.            Construction workers move tonnes of cement and steel. The statue is a mixture of concrete and steel framework for the core, covered by an exterior cladding of bronze          Chinese workers finish for the day after working on the statue\u0027s construction.

Why don\u0027t you join me?           It was beloved Democrat congressman Mo Udall who would help teach McCain the benefits of working with the opposing party\u0027All these journalists would show up to hear what Mo had to say. In the middle of it all, Mo would point to me and say, I\u0027d like to hear John\u0027s views. Well, hell, I didn\u0027t have any views. But I got up and learned and was introduced to the state.\u0027 When McCain won a seat in the Senate four years later, it was Udall\u0027s influence that he credited. \u0027There\u0027s no way Mo could have been more wonderful,\u0027 he said. \u0027And there was no reason for him to be that way.\u0027 When Udall was struck down with Parkinson\u0027s disease, relegated to a hospital bed in Washington, it was McCain who visited him every few weeks. The senator would always come with a stack of newspaper clips to read to his mentor, specifically selected to match Udall\u0027s favorite subjects. McCain also struck up a friendship in the Senate with John Kerry, an anti-war protester who at first sight would seem like a surprising accomplice to the former POW. But together they worked on helping to restore America\u0027s relations with Vietnam.Kerry revealed that a connection formed between the pair thanks to one conversation on a long flight.           McCain also struck up a friendship in the Senate with John Kerry, an anti-war protester who at first sight would seem like a surprising accomplice to the former POW\u0027We traveled together to Vietnam and we found common ground in the improbable place,\u0027 Kerry said on Saturday following McCain\u0027s death. \u0027I stood with John, the two of us alone, in the very cell in the Hanoi Hilton where years of his life were lived out in pain but always in honor.\u0027 Their friendship endured and Kerry revealed McCain always believed that one day America would come together as well. \u0027John McCain showed all of us how to bridge the ide between a protester and a POW, and how to find common ground even when it was improbable. \u0027I will be grateful for that lesson every day of my life.\u0027 Even when he was accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, McCain wanted to make it clear that he did not see Barack Obama as his enemy.           Even when he was accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, McCain said of Obama: \u0027Much more unites us than ides us\u0027 \u0027You have my respect and admiration,\u0027 he said in a direct address to Obama at the Republican National Convention. \u0027Despite our differences, much more unites us than ides us. We are fellow Americans, and that\u0027s an association that means more to me than any other.\u0027 And even when a Republican went on to take the presidency in 2016, McCain - unlike many of his fellow congressman - did not bow to party loyalty. The Maverick made it clear from 2015, when Trump called Mexicans \u0027rapists\u0027, that he did not agree with the bombastic businessman\u0027s statements.  And while McCain refrained from ever responding - or matching - the president\u0027s vicious personal attacks, he made it clear in his last speech that he did not agree with the direction Trump was taking America.      As Congress becomes increasingly partisan, McCain serves as a symbol of the enduring Maverick. Pictured are flags flying half-staff in honor of McCain at the Capital on Sunday \u0027To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain the last best hope of Earth for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems, is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history,\u0027 he said last year in Philadelphia. The bad blood between the two men was so thick that it was made known, even before McCain\u0027s passing, that Trump would not be invited to his funeral.John McCain\u0027s body is given a police escort as it\u0027s taken to...Donald Trump does NOT pay tribute to John McCain\u0027s personal...Share this articleBut in one last display of bipartisanship, McCain selected both Obama and George W Bush to read eulogies at his service.Still reaching across the aisle and bringing two parties together, even from the afterlife. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/21/4BB52CED00000578-6096059-image-m-52_1535143684396.jpg","title":"Sarah Palin says John McCain remembered American hero","story":"    In an exclusive interview with DailyMail TV, Palin, 54, and her husband Todd, 53, reflected on her time as McCain\u0027s running mate during the 2008 presidential election          Game changer: Sarah Palin gave John McCain\u0027s campaign an enormous boost when she first joined as his vice presidential running mate in 2008\u0027I don\u0027t think inherently he necessarily was really connected, so he did rely on people telling him - in polls - telling him and…he went from there. \u0027I think that\u0027s unfortunate because he had some strange people around him and..disloyal people, and you know, I don\u0027t say that as like hate speech or griping about it, it\u0027s just a fact they were just some not nice people.\u0027 Todd added: \u0027But when she was doing debate prep for a big debate with Biden or just wanted to talk about some issue, she could have like four or five people around her with all the cue cards and all this and sit there for hours and not accomplish much. \u0027But sit in the back of the bus with John and her and it was awesome to watch. So, I just respected John and he had a huge heart you know.\u0027  Sarah said McCain had agreed with her about not letting other people \u0027mold you into something you\u0027re not.\u0027\u0027You can\u0027t do that. You can\u0027t be insincere and not genuine and accomplish what needs to be done, but yeah, that was a huge lesson,\u0027 she said.  \u0027If it was just John McCain and me, or just our families together it was awesome. Those were the good times. \u0027When asked on what she believed was McCain\u0027s political legacy, she said the senator will be remembered in high respects for his military service. \u0027The unfortunate part about it will be that I think some of the people around him- still try to undermine us.          McCain and Cindy had four children together - Meghan (center), Jack and James, in addition to adopting a daughter, Bridget, from Bangladesh  The senator has been battling cancer for the past year and relocated indefinitely to his home in Arizona last December. He is pictured right with his daughter Meghan  \u0027Part of that legacy unfortunately will be some of these people that had influence on him will, unfortunately, they really took advantage of, and that wasn\u0027t good. The former governor and her husband also spoke out against claims that McCain had regretted picking her as his running mate.The 81-year-old revealed in his memoir, The Restless Wave, published in April, that he wished he had chosen Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman as his VP instead.In an earlier interview with DailyMailTV in May, Palin had said she attributed his statements to \u0027his ghostwriters.\u0027\u0027I was reading part of his book and he had nothing but praise her. He had one little sentence where he was saying maybe I should have picked Joe,\u0027 Todd said. \u0027Four-five little words. He praised her and how he selected her, but that\u0027s how it works…that\u0027s how the perception in the media works.\u0027 Sarah reiterated that McCain had never told her those sentiments himself. \u0027Well, with that headline though that he evidently regretted picking me, well my thought was, well he\u0027s never said that to me.\u0027We\u0027ve always had great conversations and thankfulness that I accepted the opportunity, and was given the opportunity. It\u0027s all been good.           Then Republican presidential candidate John McCain (C) greets family members of his running mate, vice presidential candidate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, upon his arrival to attend the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis in 2008\u0027I had never heard that from him before and…it\u0027s a shame to live life with regrets especially like that, that would be a huge regret. That\u0027s life-changing, nation-changing regret. Let it be a lesson that we not live life with regrets.\u0027 The two had kept in touch over the years after their failed campaign despite their differences, Palin said. \u0027We\u0027ve always had great conversations- and we\u0027ve been able to agree to disagree, certainly on political issues.John McCain, 81, halts his medical care: Senator\u0027s daughter...Melania to leave her mark on the White House grounds by...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/22/4F65BFA000000578-6097159-image-a-207_1535232156389.jpg","title":"Smiling Pope Francis steps plane Dublin papal visit Ireland","story":"    An estimated 82,500 people turned out to Dublin\u0027s Croke Park Stadium on Saturday evening for the Festival of Families.

The private meeting was hosted at the Papal Nuncio\u0027s residence in Dublin, hours after he acknowledged that Irish people had a right to be outraged by the church\u0027s response to the crimes.The enthusiastic crowd\u0027s standing ovation rounded off the pope\u0027s first day in Ireland, which has seen him speak of his \u0027pain and shame\u0027 at the \u0027grave scandal\u0027 of clerical sex abuse amid protests over the Catholic Church scandal – as thousands of admirers crowded the streets of Dublin to wave and watch him go by in his custom-made Popemobile.

Among the victims was Marie Collins, a prominent survivor who served on Francis\u0027 advisory board but quit in frustration last year. She has since become a harsh critic of the Vatican, and occasionally the pope.

This afternoon he met Ireland\u0027s first gay prime minister.Tens of thousands gathered in Dublin as he passed through in his Popemobile, a Skoda Rapid model, waving and smiling to the crowds on Dame Street. But demonstrators also assembled around the city to protest against clerical crimes, amid a row over the Vatican\u0027s response to similar claims of institutional abuse in America.

I myself share those sentiments.\u0027 \u0027It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole,\u0027 he said. He also praised his predecessor, Benedict XVI, for tackling the issue, saying: \u0027His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the church\u0027s leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again.\u0027 Mr Varadkar said he hoped the papal visit would mark a \u0027new chapter\u0027 in Ireland\u0027s relationship with the Catholic Church.In his speech to the pope at Dublin Castle, he said both church and state had a history of \u0027sorrow and shame,\u0027 and he urged the pope to ensure that victims of sex abuse find \u0027justice and truth and healing\u0027.Varadkar cited the recent Pennsylvania grand jury report, which found 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses, in urging Francis to \u0027ensure that from words flow actions\u0027.Pope to pray before relics of Ireland\u0027s \u0027holy drinker\u0027 Matt...British tourists are hunted by Italian police after...A third of families in Ireland no longer fit the Catholic...Share this article\u0027In recent weeks, we have all listened to heart-breaking stories from Pennsylvania of brutal crimes perpetrated by people within the Catholic Church, and then obscured to protect the institution at the expense of innocent victims,\u0027 Varadkar said. \u0027It\u0027s a story all too tragically familiar here in Ireland.\u0027The taoiseach added: \u0027The Ireland of the 21st century is a very different place today than it was in the past. Ireland is increasingly erse.  \u0027One in six of us were not born here and there are more and more people who adhere to other faiths, or who are comfortable in declaring that they subscribe to no organised religion.\u0027We have voted in our parliament and by referendum to modernise our laws – understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents or parents who are orced.\u0027He added: \u0027Holy Father, I believe that the time has now come for us to build a new relationship between church and state in Ireland – a new covenant for the 21st century. It is my hope that your visit marks the opening of a new chapter in the relationship between Ireland and the Catholic Church.\u0027Building on our intertwined history, and learning from our shared mistakes, it can be one in which religion is no longer at the centre of our society, but in which it still has an important place.\u0027            The Popemobile and its convoy drive through the streets of Dublin today greeted by cheering crowds of well-wishers           Pope Francis waves to the faithful on his popemobile in Dublin where thousands of people greeted the 81-year-old pontiff          Pope Francis greets the public as he travels through the city in the Popemobile, a converted Skoda Rapid, on Saturday          Pope Francis waves to admirers as his Popemobile carries the 81-year-old pontiff through the streets of Dublin today           The Pope puts his hand to his head before he speaks alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at St Patrick\u0027s Hall in Dublin today           Pope Francis, centre, is flanked by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, right, as they arrive to make speeches in Dublin today    Pope Francis meets with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle where they spoke about historical sex abuse     Pope Francis meets the President of Ireland Michael D.

Why don\u0027t you join me?           It was beloved Democrat congressman Mo Udall who would help teach McCain the benefits of working with the opposing party\u0027All these journalists would show up to hear what Mo had to say. In the middle of it all, Mo would point to me and say, I\u0027d like to hear John\u0027s views. Well, hell, I didn\u0027t have any views. But I got up and learned and was introduced to the state.\u0027 When McCain won a seat in the Senate four years later, it was Udall\u0027s influence that he credited. \u0027There\u0027s no way Mo could have been more wonderful,\u0027 he said. \u0027And there was no reason for him to be that way.\u0027 When Udall was struck down with Parkinson\u0027s disease, relegated to a hospital bed in Washington, it was McCain who visited him every few weeks. The senator would always come with a stack of newspaper clips to read to his mentor, specifically selected to match Udall\u0027s favorite subjects. McCain also struck up a friendship in the Senate with John Kerry, an anti-war protester who at first sight would seem like a surprising accomplice to the former POW. But together they worked on helping to restore America\u0027s relations with Vietnam.Kerry revealed that a connection formed between the pair thanks to one conversation on a long flight.           McCain also struck up a friendship in the Senate with John Kerry, an anti-war protester who at first sight would seem like a surprising accomplice to the former POW\u0027We traveled together to Vietnam and we found common ground in the improbable place,\u0027 Kerry said on Saturday following McCain\u0027s death. \u0027I stood with John, the two of us alone, in the very cell in the Hanoi Hilton where years of his life were lived out in pain but always in honor.\u0027 Their friendship endured and Kerry revealed McCain always believed that one day America would come together as well. \u0027John McCain showed all of us how to bridge the ide between a protester and a POW, and how to find common ground even when it was improbable. \u0027I will be grateful for that lesson every day of my life.\u0027 Even when he was accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, McCain wanted to make it clear that he did not see Barack Obama as his enemy.           Even when he was accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, McCain said of Obama: \u0027Much more unites us than ides us\u0027 \u0027You have my respect and admiration,\u0027 he said in a direct address to Obama at the Republican National Convention. \u0027Despite our differences, much more unites us than ides us. We are fellow Americans, and that\u0027s an association that means more to me than any other.\u0027 And even when a Republican went on to take the presidency in 2016, McCain - unlike many of his fellow congressman - did not bow to party loyalty. The Maverick made it clear from 2015, when Trump called Mexicans \u0027rapists\u0027, that he did not agree with the bombastic businessman\u0027s statements.  And while McCain refrained from ever responding - or matching - the president\u0027s vicious personal attacks, he made it clear in his last speech that he did not agree with the direction Trump was taking America.      As Congress becomes increasingly partisan, McCain serves as a symbol of the enduring Maverick.

Attoh is half-Dutch on her mother’s side, half-Ghanaian on her father’s, and identifies as mixed-race. Born in the UK, she spent most of the first 23 years of her life in Accra and Amsterdam, shuttling between cities and cultures, an experience she found enlightening but problematic. “On the one hand it allows you to develop a different understanding of the world,” she says of her duality. “But there’s still a lot of ignorance in society. People perceive you as either black or white, and you’re not – you’re mixed.”Working in London, Attoh heard similar stories from other mixed-race people, and soon she began publishing her images online (at mixedracefaces and on Instagram) alongside small texts that allowed her subjects to share personal thoughts on identity, race and self, something they couldn’t do elsewhere. Following the death of her mother, to whom the series is dedicated, the project helped Attoh dissect her own multiracial experience – what it means to be connected to two worlds at once, and how society perceives that condition – but it has also sparked an open forum on ersity. “It’s not a topic people usually talk about,” Attoh says. “So the website has become a platform for people with mixed heritage. It’s given a lot of them a sense of belonging.”When she was starting out, friends and family corralled subjects for Attoh to shoot. (She is indebted to her family, she says, for the work they’ve contributed for free: the space in which the portraits are taken is co-run by her son the 90 or so hour-long interviews were transcribed by her daughter-in-law, often late at night.) Now subjects, keen to share their personal histories, approach Attoh directly, and she notices themes reoccurring. Many subjects celebrate the benefit of being able to flit between cultures while embracing both. Others talk of the strain inherent in not being of one place – of being from neither here nor there, tugged between one identity and another. Some find it easy, others less so.Attoh has now taken more than 90 images, a selection of which are published here. Those photographed represent great portions of the world – Japan, Jamaica, Malaysia, Sweden, Iran, China, South Africa – but also provide a portrait of contemporary Britain. In the 2011 census 1.25 million people identified as mixed race, making it the fastest-growing ethnic group in the UK. “A mixed-race girl just married a prince!” says Attoh. But discrimination persists. “It’s 2018, and mixed-race people are still asked the question, ‘Where are you really from?’”Later this year Attoh will organise an exhibition of the photos she’s made so far. In the meantime she’ll turn her lens on subjects in Holland, to examine differences in the mixed-race experience. But mostly her project is meant to raise public awareness. “I’m hoping it will become a platform for wider discussion,” Attoh says. “To help people understand these different points of view, these different experiences.”I grew up in Moscow until I was about nine and then we moved to the UK. I feel Russian, really. I speak Russian at home. Culturally I don’t have any real Korean connections if anything, I feel more British than North Korean. When I was younger I didn’t want to be Asian at all I was embarrassed by it. It doesn’t bother me now, but then I alternated between thinking it was something interesting about myself and hating the fact that I looked different. I really wanted to have lighter hair.I’m Irish on my dad’s side, mixed Jamaican and Indian on my mum’s. There are times I feel like the odd one out, especially at family functions. You’ll see a sea of white faces, and then there’s me and my brother. It can be isolating there aren’t many people I can relate to. In my adult years I’ve learned to appreciate where I come from. I can’t tell people I’m one race because I’d be disrespecting the other. I try to maintain the balance.I was born and raised in San Francisco. My mother is Colombian and my dad is mixed Scottish and English. They met on a blind date 14 days later they were married. When I was little I was very dark, but when I turned seven I became very fair. There was an awkward time when people thought my mum was my nanny. Because I was so light-skinned I would embrace being English rather than being Colombian. My son is a blond-haired, blue-eyed child, but I want him to know he is mixed Colombian.I was born in London but lived in Mexico until I was eight because of my disability – I was born deaf. I went to live with my grandmother in a small village. We had a pet donkey called Jesús. We also had chickens, pigs, goats, you name it. It was a great childhood. But in school in Mexico, I was always seen as being different. In Mexico people call each other by nicknames. My family’s nickname was ‘Japonicitos’ – Japanese. In Mexico they’d never really seen an Oriental person before, apart from what they’d seen on TV, on Dragon Ball Z.I’ve spent my whole life in England so I’ve always identified as British. My mother is half-Jamaican and half-Indian my dad is half-English and half-Irish. I appreciated visiting people on both sides of the family each time I could learn and experience different and unique things about the cultures I was connected to: food, music, traditions, stories. It was interesting to hear from those who spoke patois, while others spoke with London accents. Though sometimes the middle ground felt like a lonely place.I’m a teacher, I spend a lot of time with younger people, and I’m hearing so many younger mixed-race people interrogating what they call their ‘privilege theory’. What are their privileges as a light-skinned person? How does their status relate to that of their darker-skinned friends, or people who look more African or more European? It’s a hell of a thing to navigate, and I think there’s a pressure on younger people to understand it. But your identity can be about many things. It doesn’t have to be just about race. It could be about being a parent, a cyclist, a musician.Dad and Mum met in Lesotho. Dad worked for NGOs. I was born in Wales, but I didn’t live in the UK until I was 13. When we were young we lived in many countries: Ghana, Uganda, Mali, Kenya. I loved the food in Ghana. Even for a mixed-race person I’m quite fair, so until I was 13 I thought of myself as white (every African country has a word for ‘white person’.) When I came to the UK I was told I was black. It highlighted a lot about race: how so much of your identity is what other people put on you.My mum’s family are from Cyprus. My dad’s family are Jamaican, with African heritage. But I grew up in northwest London. When I was the president of the African Caribbean Society at university, one of my friends who ran the society with me told me I wasn’t really black because I had a white mum. I think from that point onwards I’ve always referred to myself as black – very intentionally. I stand in solidarity with all black people. I don’t think being mixed makes me any less black.

At a time of great uncertainty on Britain’s high streets, with some of the best known names in retail struggling or going bust, Angling Direct is opening more shops. Its 23rd shop will open its doors to customers in Guildford on 1 September, soon to be followed by a 24th store in Peterborough. The company has identified another 20 other popular fishing locations for future stores.“It’s a tactile product,” Bailey explains. “People like to see it, touch it, feel it. They might wait until a later date to buy it online but they still want to see the products in the shops.”Angling Direct sells a vast assortment of more than 21,500 fishing tackle products, ranging from a £1 bag of hooks to poles that will set you back nearly £4,000.The company does not sell through Amazon and, as yet, has not suffered at the hands of the online retailer. Bailey says that while it is always wise to keep an eye on what Amazon is doing – it does sell some fishing tackle – he’s not too concerned: “Customers want specialist service and advice, and you can’t get that from Amazon.”For a business that began with fishing tackle shops in Norfolk, Bailey now has ambitions beyond UK shores. Angling Direct already exports to more than 40 countries and launched a German website in June, with other European websites to follow later in the year.The company floated on the Alternative Investment Market in July last year, to fund the expansion that Bailey is now seeing through. Shares have risen from 64p to 107p over the period.The rapid growth in sales is thanks to that expansion and investment, both in stores and online, rather than an explosion of people taking up fishing as a hobby.As for his own hobby, Bailey doesn’t get out fishing as much as he would like to these days. He went fishing for the first time in 2018 last week, on the River Trent.The ideal weather for a spot of fishing and a further boost to sales? “I’m hoping for an Indian summer and a normal British winter,” Bailey says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f28f529c146400dda66324c5249b2f","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Yet a year ago in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, “never again” happened all over again.On 25 August 2017, the army unleashed a military offensive that forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee their villages into neighbouring Bangladesh. It is believed that thousands were killed. Human rights organisations have reported mass rape and eyewitness accounts describe babies and children snatched from their parents’ arms and thrown into burning homes or drowned in rivers. Families were burned alive in their homes, villagers lined up and shot and civilians targeted indiscriminately. Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein, the outgoing United Nations high commissioner for human rights, described what happened as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”, and the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, said she saw “the hallmarks of genocide”.Within the next few weeks, two significant reports will be published. The United States is expected to release the results of its investigation, which may conclude that what has occurred is genocide. The UN fact-finding mission, established before the offensive began last year, will present its report and may well recommend mechanisms for accountability. The evidence and recommendations of these reports must receive serious attention – it is essential that the international community summons the political will to act. This coming week, the UN security council will discuss the situation again, as it has done on several occasions already. Such discussions are vital, but they must move from talk to action.And yet of course the crisis did not begin a year ago. The plight of the Rohingya has been severe for decades. This predominantly Muslim population has been subjected to dehumanisation and marginalisation, stripped of citizenship rights, rendered stateless and facing restrictions on movement, marriage, access to education and healthcare and freedom of religion or belief.In 2012, violence broke out between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, leaving thousands displaced and parts of the state smouldering. Rohingya were held in dire conditions in camps that observers compare to internment centres. A new campaign by the Myanmar military broke out in October 2016, a prelude to last year’s dramatic escalation.What, then, should be done? The European Union, the US and Canada have imposed visa bans on a few military and security personnel, which is a welcome step, and Washington has recently strengthened some sanctions against some iniduals, although not yet the man ultimately responsible, the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing. But there is no global arms embargo, no targeted sanctions against military-owned enterprises and no action to end impunity by referring the perpetrators of crimes against humanity to the international criminal court. These are steps that the UN and its member states should now adopt.Ending impunity is essential because history shows that if those who perpetrate crimes against humanity get away with it, they or others will take it as a signal that they can repeat the same crimes. We warned of this 18 months ago.But we must also consider what else can be done in addition to justice and accountability. Myanmar has been torn apart by decades of ethnic conflict, fuelled in recent years by religious intolerance and hatred. Constructive steps towards long-term peace-building and reconciliation are needed, to counter the voices of intolerance and promote the principle of freedom of religion or belief, based on respect for human dignity, for every person of every race in Myanmar. Narratives need to be challenged, hate speech countered, the citizenship rights of the Rohingya respected, voices of peace within all religions strengthened and a genuine peace process and political dialogue enhanced.Perhaps there is a role for trusted international mediators whose only agenda is the basic dignity of all. Pope Francis visited the country last year and delivered this message – perhaps his good offices could play a role in bringing the different peoples of Myanmar, of different races and religions, including the Rohingya, together in dialogue. For one thing is absolutely certain: if hatred, deeply entrenched in society but manipulated by Myanmar’s still powerful military, is not addressed, we will be lamenting “again and again” our failure to live up to our responsibility to protect.Jan Figel is the European Union’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief outside the EUBenedict Rogers is East Asia team leader at the human rights organisation CSW"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9509ed6592f986b7759bca029d94e0401c7577f1/0_100_1797_1078/master/1797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77bad37490f9608ba9882896b1d27708","title":"no deal brexit may be unthinkable but that doesnt mean it cant happen","story":"There’s this much to be said for Brexit. It is a continuing education about our country and its mutual and intricate dependencies with our closest neighbours. Did you know – I didn’t – that almost half of the human sperm imported by Britain comes from the sturdily productive menfolk of Denmark? This is one of the more fascinating revelations in the first batch of government “guidance” documents about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The 24 papers released so far – with 56 more to come – are supposed to illuminate what it would mean were Britain to tumble out of the EU without any agreement about the future relationship.This exercise was originally demanded by the hard Brexiters when they were all in a clamour for the government to put more effort into planning for no deal and lambasting Theresa May for not overcoming the Treasury’s resistance to spending a lot of money on the exercise. Some of the Brexiters made their demand for these assessments in the belief that it would fortify Mrs May’s bargaining position with Brussels by signalling that she was ready to stomp out if Britain didn’t get what it wanted. Others sought “preparations” for a collapse of the negotiations because they have always willed the talks to fail. They have always been no-dealers. There is not a majority in Britain, not in parliament and not among the voters, for a really hard Brexit, but there is a noisy faction of the Tory party that yearns for precisely that. Most Britons would rather swerve than go off a cliff edge, but the Brextremists want to hammer the accelerator.Yet there really is no pleasing some people. The government has started to gratify their demand – and now they are angry that they are getting what they say they wanted. Brexiters are heard complaining that the release of these papers is being orchestrated to scare the Tory party and the electorate about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Ministers insist that, to the contrary, they are holding back some of the most blood-curdling stuff lest it trigger a public panic. The real issue with the documents issued by the government is not that they are alarmist and oozing with gory warnings. It is that these “technical papers” are skimpy and vague on critical detail and of not much help to anyone – a business, say, or a hospital or a food importer – who would have to cope with the havoc that would follow from a car-crash Brexit.They offer statements of the bleedin’ obvious – “the free circulation of goods between the UK and the EU would cease” – and then follow up with vapid tips about how businesses might want to “consider your role in EU supply chains”. To say that the government has “a plan” for a no-deal Brexit is to abuse the English language. The recommendation to businesses trading across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is to “ask Dublin” what they should do. Phone a friend, eh? The logistics company, ParcelHero caustically observes that the government’s advice on how to cope with a no-deal Brexit is as much use as the Protect and Survive booklets issued during the cold war, which told people that the way to respond to a nuclear attack was to “use tables if they are large enough” to hide from the blast.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has tried to put a cheery face on his department’s handiwork. He accepts that the impact of a bad Brexit wouldn’t be nice, but claims that the worst effects can be mitigated if only the nation is prepared to greet disaster with optimism and resolve. A campaigner for departure in the referendum, Mr Raab extols us to believe that Britain is capable of “rising to the challenges and seizing the opportunities”. Men of Britain, he is talking to you. If we get cut off from supplies of Danish sperm, Mr Raab will be expecting you to seize your, er, opportunities and rise to the challenge and show some patriotic spunk.A sperm shortage would be one of Britain’s lower-order problems in the event of a departure without a deal. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has published a letter predicting dreadful consequences for the economy if Britain crashes out of the EU next March. The Treasury guesses that it would take a very big bite out of economic growth and add £80bn to government borrowing. The Brexiters scorn those figures and the rest of us are entitled to be suspicious of the accuracy of this forecast. Only when we are some way past Brexit will it be possible to make a solid assessment of all its consequences.What we can say now is this. There is already a price for Brexit. It is costing us now. One cost is the investment decisions delayed, cancelled or relocated because of Brexit uncertainty. Another price is in the already large amounts of thought, time and cash expended by business, government and many other organisations on contingency planning. That energy and money could have been used more productively elsewhere and can’t be recouped even in the event that Brexit turns out all right. There is an unrecoverable bill for precautionary measures to ameliorate the impact of a bad Brexit, such as telling pharmaceutical companies to assemble crisis-level stockpiles of medicines.Then there is the big opportunity cost that Britain is already paying for Brexit. All the other things that its politicians might be doing, such as remedying the shortage of affordable homes or addressing the crisis in social care, are thrust to the margins because Brexit is so all-consuming.The price escalates dramatically in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Not only would there be no future agreement on trade, all the understandings that have already been reached with the EU would be vaporised. There would be no assurances on the future of British citizens living in EU countries or on the future of EU citizens living in Britain. There would be no agreement on the Irish border nor on co-operation against crime and terrorism.A no deal could come in one of two forms. The less apocalyptic, but still highly turbulent version would see the negotiations grind into deadlock before collapse. Britain and the EU would then announce that they were abandoning hope of coming to a comprehensive withdrawal agreement. This would be followed by crisis talks in the short time left before Britain departs to try to agree emergency measures in key areas to avert complete chaos. That would be by no means pain-free. Without any understanding on trade, customs checks and tariffs would go up the moment that Britain left. The people who run our ports warn that the abrupt termination of frictionless commerce with Europe would lead to motorways turning into giant lorry parks accompanied by massive disruptions to supply chains.The transition period currently agreed would become null and void. Absent that plan, which envisages a glidepath out of current trading arrangements, there would be a free fall. This is the milder version of a no deal. It is an outcome that is being talked about with increasing frequency by significant players in the EU and by ministers here.The entirely unmitigated cast-strength version of no deal would see the negotiations collapse in bitter acrimony and few, if any, remedial holding agreements to try to avoid a total calamity. The National Farmers’ Union forecasts disastrous consequences for the food supply. The British Medical Association says there will be alarming implications for the health service, including delays in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions. You can dismiss all this as just scaremongering, as the Brextremists like to do when their fantasies collide with someone who might know what they are talking about. Or you can think that the many commercial and professional bodies that are scared rigid by the thought of a no-deal Brexit might be sober people with serious concerns who feel it a public duty to share their alarm.Britain is not at all prepared for a no deal and neither is the EU. Because the consequences would be so horrendous, it is still often thought that a way will be found to avoid it. On that rests the assumption that there will be something called an agreement in the end, even if it is an almighty fudge that leaves a lot to be resolved after Britain has left. Against that, you have to observe that there has been so much miscalculation about this already and the political context is so febrile that the wise man does not entirely rule out the very worst-case scenarios. So check the size and robustness of your kitchen table and have your family practise duck and cover."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19d007928d59859e148d21dd60a1004159cd51e1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fbad237854f2ca00b950dd53e1a319f","title":"the ultimate guide to autumn tv film music theatre politics sport","story":"A musical Twelfth Night, Michelle Obama’s memoirs and the last ever gig by Ennio Morricone: our critics preview the new season• Jay Rayner on the best of autumn food• Morwenna Ferrier on five key seasonal fashion trends• Andrew Rawnsley on what to expect from politics Bodyguard (BBC One, 9pm) has autumn’s new TV off to a roaring start. Jed Mercurio’s new series about an autocratic home secretary (Keeley Hawes) and the man charged with protecting her (Richard Madden), is a twisty political thriller and arguably the most nail-biting new series of the year.It’s not the only politically tinged drama on the BBC this autumn. Hugo Blick’s much-awaited Black Earth Rising starring John Goodman and Michaela Coel arrives on BBC Two next month followed by Korean director Park Chan-wook’s certain-to-be-visceral take on John le Carré’s classic The Little Drummer Girl (BBC One). Meanwhile, Mike Bartlett’s Press offers a different kind of tension as two rival newspapers do battle in the age of internet news (BBC One, September).Over on ITV, September sees Regency-era intrigue with a star-laden Vanity Fair and twisty thrills in Strangers, starring John Simm. A topical tale of a transgender child follows in October with Tony Marchant’s sensitive Butterfly starring Anna Friel. Channel 4 aims boldly for infinity and beyond as Sean Penn leads the cast of mission-to-Mars drama The First in October, David Simon’s The Deuce returns to Sky Atlantic on 26 September and lovers of the supernatural can either swoon to Sky One’s sweeping take on Deborah Harkness’s romantic fantasy A Discovery of Witches (September) or shudder to Netflix’s dark reimagining The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina in time for Halloween.Autumn’s most eagerly awaited new comedy is Desiree Akhavan’s tale of life and love in London, The Bisexual (Channel 4, October). Elsewhere, the gang from Kurupt FM make the jump to BBC Two for the final series of mockumentary sitcom People Just Do Nothing (late 2018), the ever-inventive The Good Place returns to Netflix (September) and Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith get spooky with a live Halloween edition of Inside No 9.The centenary of the first world war armistice brings with it a host of programming including Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old in conjunction with the Imperial War Museum (BBC One, November) while fans of The Crown should check out Princess Margaret, a new two-part documentary on BBC Two.Finally, autumn wouldn’t be autumn without reality juggernauts Great British Bake Off (Channel 4, starting on Tuesday) and Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, September), while national treasure David Attenborough returns with Dynasty, a five-part series about power, family and territory that promises to be just as tense as anything fiction can provide (BBC One).After a five-year hiatus, I’m giddily awaiting the return of British director Steve McQueen. Widows (Nov) is inspired by a TV series that was on ITV in the early 1980s. Co-written with Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, it’s a mobster movie with Viola Davis leading a pack of women out for revenge (“No one thinks we have the balls to pull this off,” she says, ballsily). I’m happy to see McQueen making a contemporary film after 12 Years a Slave’s period setting and am on the lookout for his signature geometric framing and installation-like sequences. Luca Guadagnino’s reinterpretation of Dario Argento’s 1977 cult giallo-inflected supernatural horror Suspiria (premiering at Venice film festival, Sept) reunites Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton, both of whom starred in his breezily enjoyable A Bigger Splash. Following the sun-soaked romance of Call Me By Your Name, the Italian film-maker’s light touch seems a weird fit for such dark material, so I’m intrigued to see what he brings to the project.The fourth iteration of A Star Is Born (Oct) since the Dorothy Parker-penned original in 1937 sees Lady Gaga as a country singer on the rise and, after being tossed around development hell, is directed by the actor Bradley Cooper. It looks like delicious Oscar bait. Black Panther’s Ryan Coogler and Michael B Jordan are today’s Scorsese and De Niro Rocky descendant Creed II (Nov) is their fourth collaboration and if the slick adrenaline rush of the first film is anything to go by, worth getting excited about. Elsewhere, Chloé Zhao’s The Rider (Sept) sits outside of the Hollywood horse race, but it’s a remarkable film about a young bronc rider (real life rodeo-er Brady Jandreau) struggling to retain his identity after an accident relegates him from champion to trainer. Watching Jandreau with the horses feels both like cinéma vérité, and a breathtaking ballet of non-verbal communication. Sebastian Faulks is among a host of big hitters with novels published this autumn. His superb Paris Echo (6 September) weaves winningly between the present and the second world war, between Tangiers and Paris. Sarah Moss’s Ghost Wall (20 September) is stunningly good, a tightly written, powerful book about archaeology and Englishness. Sarah Perry follows up The Essex Serpent with her gothic Melmoth (4 October) – it’s creepy and compelling. Finally, Propolis is a new indie publisher making exquisite books. The Ballad of Syd and Morgan by Hayden Middleton (26 October) brilliantly imagines a meeting between Syd Barrett and EM Forster.In nonfiction, there’s In My Mind’s Eye (6 September), a “thought diary” by the always-fascinating Jan Morris. Former record exec Will Ashon has come up with something really special in Chamber Music, the riotous history of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan (1 November). Julian Baggini’s How the World Thinks (4 October) is there to fill the Sapiens-size hole in your life, while Becoming, the autobiography of Michelle Obama (13 November), is sure to be as warm and wonderful as the woman herself. For something quite different, try The Ravenmaster by Christopher Skaife (4 October), a gloriously eccentric and terribly British memoir of life with the famous birds of the Tower of London.Not many of the arts have originators still producing captivating new work. Chair of the pantheon Paul McCartney releases his 17th solo studio album on 7 September and plays a handful of shows in the run-up to Christmas. Egypt Station filches its name from a painting of McCartney’s from 1988. Helpmeets include producers Greg Kurstin and Ryan Tedder.One of McCartney’s favourite new artists, Héloïse Letissier makes her bid for the big leagues next month. Chris, the second Christine and the Queens album, due 21 September, finds Letissier embracing her inner tomboy. “Sweaty” and “cinematic” are the buzzwords UK dates follow in November.Singer Matt Healy recently revealed that he checked himself into rehab in Barbados before beginning work on the 1975’s third album, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. The Cheshire outfit’s eagerly awaited opus is still without an official release date, but widely hoped to be landing in November. Apparently, there’s another one already waiting in the wings.Another band who fetishise 80s guitar sounds, Philadelphians the War on Drugs, bring their lush, Grammy-winning A Deeper Understanding album to London’s O2 Arena in December, their biggest date yet. Finally, wielding the baton over one last time is 89-year-old composer Ennio Morricone, who plays his last-ever UK gig on 26 November.Two returning podcasts to be excited about are Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel (Audible) and Radiotopia’s Ear Hustle. Series three of Perel’s relationship therapy podcast is framed around the evolution of marriage and follows six couples at different stages each episode is a real, unscripted consultation between psychotherapist Perel and a couple with problems. Her acute insight and verve, plus the undeniable fascination of other people’s problems, make this unmissable.Ear Hustle, which brings intimate inmate stories about life inside US prisons, is always a revealing, surprising listen series three starts in September.And the BBC will give us Intrigue: The Ratline. Told by barrister Philippe Sands, whose grandfather’s family were murdered in a Nazi extermination camp, this podcast is a “sort of mystery story” about Otto Wächter, a Nazi we’ve barely heard of, because he was never brought to justice. The Ratline was a Nazi escape line out of Europe and this promises to be a gripping tale.Bristol Old Vic boldly brings to the stage Touching the Void, mountaineer Joe Simpson’s memoir of being trapped in a crevasse in the Peruvian Andes.

Viktor Irle, a market analyst at the group, said: “A stock of one million electric vehicles is an important milestone on the road to electrification and meeting emission targets but it is of course not enough.”The figures include fully electric cars and vans, plus plug-in hybrid ones, which can travel a short distance off a battery before switching to a conventional engine.However, rapid growth in Germany means Europe’s biggest car market is set to overtake Norway by the end of the year for total sales.The Netherlands and Denmark also posted good growth but the UK had only moderate growth because of what EV-Volumes called a lack of compelling models from domestic manufacturers Ford and Vauxhall. Pivot Power, a firm which hopes to build a UK-wide network of rapid electric car chargers, said the UK was well-positioned to catch up with its Nordic peers.“The one millionth sale this year is a clear signal of consumer intent.

Combining the stylistic slickness of 25th Hour with the controversial potential of Bamboozled, it’s a stranger-than-fiction tale (“based upon some fo’ real, fo’ real shit”) of an African American cop infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1970s. Produced by the team behind Get Out (it was Jordan Peele who brought the story to Lee), BlacKkKlansman slips seamlessly from borderline-absurdist humour to all-too-real horror, conjuring an urgent blend of sociopolitical period satire and contemporary wake-up call.John David Washington gives a wonderfully wry and nuanced central performance as Ron Stallworth, an afro-sporting idealist who becomes “the Jackie Robinson” of the formerly all-white Colorado Springs police force. Graduating swiftly from records to intelligence, Stallworth answers a newspaper ad for the KKK, posing on the telephone as a budding white supremacist. When face-to-face meetings are required, Stallworth’s Jewish colleague Flip Zimmerman (a brooding Adam Driver) is drafted in to press the flesh at meetings where homemade terrorism is served up with cheese and crackers, the tension heightened by the weird domesticity.Soon, a relationship is being built with grand wizard David Duke (Topher Grace), the “smiling future” of “the organisation”, who plans to lead it from cross burnings into politics under the banner of putting “America First!” and making it “great again”. “The United States would never elect somebody like David Duke,” says Ron, prompting an accusation of naivety from his boss and a ripple of ghoulish guffaws from an audience who know how this cruel joke ends.With its long-lensed, long-take shots, captured on 35mm by cinematographer Chayse Irvin, and note-perfect production and costume design, BlacKkKlansman elegantly evokes the cinema of its setting (Lee has cited The French Connection, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon as tonal touchstones). There are playful conversations about Shaft v Super Fly and the relative merits of Richard Roundtree and Ron O’Neal, while Terence Blanchard’s sparse score blends guitar-and-drums funk with classical thriller strings. Yet there’s nothing nostalgic about this evocation of a (not so) bygone age as it juxtaposes historical racial hatred with shocking news footage of Charlottesville in 2017, and Trump’s astonishing “blame on both sides” response to neo-Nazi attacks. As with his use of the Rodney King footage in Malcolm X, Lee efficiently conflates the struggles of the past and present into a powerful cinematic continuum.What’s most remarkable is how well Lee balances the tonal shifts, provoking both laughs and gasps with a film built upon dualities: fact and fiction (Stallworth’s story is heavily fictionalised, yet rings “true”) past and present inside and outside. Just as our central figure becomes two characters folded into one (Flip explicitly questions whether his former rejection of his Jewish heritage was a form of “passing”), so BlacKkKlansman revels in mirror images. Ron’s relationship with student activist Patrice (Laura Harrier) is shadowed by creepily affectionate scenes in which a white supremacist couple cuddle while conspiring to kill. A declaration that police officers are “family” who “stick together, right or wrong” chimes with the Klan’s own twisted code, echoing a central debate about whether change can be effected from within or without the system. Angry cries of “white power” and “black power” are pointedly intercut, ricocheting around the film’s mediating message of “all power to all the people”.Alongside his trademark dolly shots, fans of Lee’s films will find threads that lead right back to the director’s 1980 short The Answer, a biting response to The Birth of a Nation that nearly got him thrown out of film school. In BlacKkKlansman, Lee returns to DW Griffith’s Klan-aggrandising epic, using it as a backdrop for a sobering lesson about the power of movies to mould attitudes, from the heroically fluttering confederate flags of Gone with the Wind to the racist stereotypes of the Tarzan serials. Yet Lee also clearly believes in cinema’s power to change people for good, lending a passionate, proselytising edge to BlacKkKlansman.From a brilliantly bilious opening appearance by Trump-scourge Alec Baldwin to the statesmanlike gravitas of Harry Belafonte, the ensemble cast packs a weighty punch, aided by standout turns from supporting players such as Ashlie Atkinson and Corey Hawkins. Yet the real star here is Lee. After the uncertainties of Oldboy and Chi-Raq, it’s great to see this admirably unruly film-maker back at the height of his provocative powers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe488ebda7080403daa802ac36c0ff7c34c9ca8/0_46_2084_1250/master/2084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9a3d07a9e4821a5441b54f254897156","title":"chelsea roman abramovich deny selling reports","story":"Chelsea are insistent their owner Roman Abramovich is not looking to sell the club.

Both Stoke and West Brom were glad to see the back of Tony Pulis, and look where they are now. And look where Pulis is now, cheerfully turning Middlesbrough into a force again and keeping pace with Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds at the top of the Championship.The word cheerfully is used carefully, for although Pulis has a reputation for functional football, his outlook is usually sunny and his attitude always positive. His reaction on missing out on the chance to sign Yannick Bolasie last week was fairly typical. “If we can’t get the players that will improve us, then we’ll work our socks off to get the best out of the ones we have,” Pulis said.Which brings us in a roundabout way to Manchester United, who would never hire a manager like Pulis in a million years but sorely need some of his unifying philosophy.José Mourinho, despite £364m spent in five transfer windows, has let it be known he is dissatisfied with the club’s failure to bring in more players over the summer. He specifically wanted another top-line centre-back and, while the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, appears to have taken the reasonable view that United are well enough staffed in that area, not least with the centre-backs Mourinho has brought in, the manager’s comments duly undermined the confidence of Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelöf at Brighton.United’s listlessness is not confined to their backline either, with various players from Paul Pogba to Anthony Martial nursing personal grievances. There has already been too much coverage of who said what and when to make interesting reading for anyone other than Manchester City fans or Mourinho-haters, but suffice to say that United at the moment are not working their socks off. They are looking like a failed experiment, and an extremely expensive one.There is a blame game going on at Old Trafford, which some choose to interpret as par for the course for a third Mourinho season and others more pointedly regard as a calculated distraction to draw attention from the unpalatable truth that United are miles behind City on the field.Some loyalists, including Dimitar Berbatov, bless him, are of the opinion any side can suffer an early-season blip and United’s title challenge will soon be back on the rails. The former United and Spurs striker even pointed out, in his capacity as a Betfair analyst, that Mourinho’s Internazionale began their all‑conquering 2009-10 season with a tame draw.Yet that was peak Mourinho, back when a capable manager was still excited by the possibilities presented by a talented group of players. This feels more like piqued Mourinho, the situation reminiscent of the isive and unnecessary stance taken against Dr Eva Carneiro and a largely blameless Chelsea medical staff in 2015. That internal rift had no happy ending and it is hard to see why this one should turn out any differently if Woodward and Mourinho are at odds with each other, and the players somewhere in between.It is also difficult to work out why Woodward handed Mourinho a contract extension last season if he knew he would be tightening the purse strings. Three years of Mourinho would probably have been enough for most United supporters, who realised some time ago he was not going to fully embrace life in Manchester or seriously challenge Pep Guardiola for supremacy of the city.Spotting the flaws in failed successions is always easier in hindsight but some United supporters are also asking themselves why a club that prides itself on playing with a certain swagger has gone for three conservative managers in a row since Sir Alex Ferguson.More might have been expected of Mourinho, though unless he can get his attacking act together very quickly he will simply be lumped in with David Moyes and Louis van Gaal as part of a generally unsatisfactory post-Ferguson continuum. The game has moved on and Old Trafford has failed to move with it, unless anyone counts stacking up official mattress, coffee and outdoor apparel partners as signs of progress.United were never going to land Guardiola, given City’s long‑standing interest and Barcelona connections, though Jürgen Klopp was under consideration at one point and might have been persuaded when frustrated at Bayern Munich picking off his best players. Klopp won the Bundesliga title and reached a Champions League final with Dortmund, which put him on United’s radar.The manager in the opposing dugout when United take on Tottenham on Monday has still not won a thing, though a theory is gaining traction that an ideal candidate has been overlooked all along. Moyes had not won anything either when United appointed him in 2013, yet by that point, even though communicating through an interpreter, Mauricio Pochettino had begun to make a name for himself at Southampton, both for an attacking brand of football and a willingness to trust young players.When Southampton finished eighth in his first full season no one queried the wisdom of replacing Nigel Adkins any more but it was Spurs who took a punt on an up-and-coming manager, while United went for what they regarded as the more reliable option in Van Gaal and were rewarded by two years of stale, passionless football.Part of the reason Mourinho was eventually welcomed, against the better judgment of some of the United board, was that he could hardly fail to perk up the place after that, yet though he has won silverware it would be hard to argue he has energised the club to the same extent Pochettino has at Spurs.Tottenham are so impressed they have awarded their manager a contract until 2023, which if he sees it out will mean a nine-year tenure. Eagle-eyed observers will have spotted this is exactly the sort of stabilitycontinuity Ferguson originally hoped Moyes would provide, vastly preferable to chopping and changing every two or three years.While there is no guarantee Pochettino would have fared any better than Moyes in the difficult period of adjustment immediately after Ferguson, there is every reason to believe he would have been more popular with United supporters than the two supposedly super-managers that followed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6aabbd7f665d5f2123e96a801c8d317559c50d0/0_15_1903_1142/master/1903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cecb4441944ad18a06d63b6a0f4eaaf0","title":"watford crystal palace premier league match report","story":"Watford’s pristine start to the new season has been maintained, with this a victory to be cherished in this corner of Hertfordshire. Their collisions with Crystal Palace have tended to be feisty over recent years, and rarely won on home territory, so there was delight to be had in claiming a third successive win at the start of a top‑flight season for the first time in their history at the expense of these opponents.Even now those pessimistic preseason noises about a campaign of toil lying ahead feel deceptive. Once Watford found their rhythm here, and it did take them time, there was a fine blend of attacking zest and aggression to their game which, at the very least, should keep them well clear of trouble for another season.Watford made life difficult for themselves when Wilfried Zaha, a pantomime villain in these parts, somehow escaped an assistant’s offside flag from Max Meyer’s pass and fizzed a shot through Ben Foster to halve Palace’s deficit. But the visitors could not follow up with an equaliser, Joel Ward planting a free header wide in stoppage time, and ended up paying for missing fine opportunities earlier in the game.Zaha, departing to catcalls, will have taken no pleasure from his consolation. This had been a snarl of a game from the outset between opponents whose rivalry has been stoked by regular recent meetings. The tone had been set by Étienne Capoue’s raking of Zaha’s right ankle early on, the midfielder’s little jump into the foul giving it an ugly feel, with the hosts intent upon playing on the Ivorian’s apparently suspect temperament. He had been booked on his previous three visits to this arena and, riled by that early treatment, would endure the same indignity within the opening 10 minutes for a foul on José Holebas. That Daryl Janmaat escaped sanction for a similar follow-through on Patrick van Aanholt seconds later merely fuelled the suspicion of inconsistency.Zaha’s every touch would provoke a familiar chorus of boos from the home support though, in truth, other Palace players were unnerving the hosts. The visitors would repel a flurry of late chances just before half-time as Watford roused themselves but, by then, should have established a lead of their own with the locals thankful for Foster’s excellence. The goalkeeper, back here for a second spell having enjoyed two seasons on loan over a decade ago, reacted superbly to push away Christian Benteke’s header from Andros Townsend’s cross with an outstretched right hand. When James McArthur collected from the winger’s centre and took a touch around Craig Cathcart moments later, there was Foster again to deny the midfielder from point-blank range.Roy Hodgson, bedraggled on the sidelines, could barely comprehend quite how it had been missed though, as it transpired, those would prove his team’s most inviting chances of the afternoon. The Palace manager had lost James Tomkins to a calf injury in the warm-up, with the absence of the influential centre-half potentially critical given the success he has enjoyed alongside Mamadou Sakho of late. Last week’s defeat against Liverpool was a first in 14 top-flight games in which the pair have started. Yet, other than a shot from Roberto Pereyra deflected over the bar by McArthur, the home side’s threat had been fitful up to the interval.There was more urgency to their approach after the break, with Will Hughes thumping a shot into Wayne Hennessey’s midriff when free at the far post and Palace suddenly labouring in the drizzle. Pereyra, found calmly by Abdoulaye Doucouré’s pass, would blaze over the bar but, eventually, the Argentinian would find his range. His third goal of the campaign to date stemmed from Zaha surrendering possession deep in enemy territory and Capoue surging forward, holding off weak attempts at a challenge from McArthur and Luka Milivojevic en route. He spread the ball wide to Pereyra who cut inside Ward and Townsend before curling a delicious shot beyond the ing Hennessey and into the far corner.The visitors stirred briefly, Benteke spinning to rasp a shot marginally wide of Foster’s upright, but passes tend to be overhit in the final third when composure was required. Indeed, the momentum was with the hosts. The game had entered its last quarter when Holebas, cutting inside Townsend, lofted over a shot which arced gloriously over Hennessey and Van Aanholt, retreating on to the goalline, to nestle in the far corner. Zaha’s riposte made life uncomfortable in what time remained, but Watford held out to enjoy life joint top of the table."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ebb0d58760d8c70513a2af95b1d435","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The unhappy Fabian Schar is replaced by Yoshinori Muto.79 min Chelsea’s final change: Ross Barkley replaces the lively Mateo Kovacic.77 min Newcastle are fuming about the penalty decision, and you can understandwhy. Schar got a lot on the ball as he challenged from the side before taking Alonso down in his follow through. That looks a really harsh decision.Eden Hazard doesn’t miss penalties, and this one is crashed emphatically into the left corner. Dubravka went the right way but had almost no chance of getting to it.76 min Alonso gets the wrong side of Schar and goes down, and Paul Tierney gives the penalty.72 min: Rudiger hits the bar! That was a spectacular effort. He pushed the ball forward and hit a ferocious shot from 30 yards that beat Dubravka for pace and slammed off the bar.71 min In the second half - and you’ll like this - Newcastle have had 10 per cent possession.70 min Another yellow card: Ritchie is booked for flattening Hazard. That was a nasty tackle.69 min Another change for Chelsea: Willian replaces Pedro.68 min Fernandez is booked for a late tackle on Kovacic.67 min Newcastle’s tactics will doubtless be criticised, but in the circumstances I can understand their approach. And they have defended admirably, with both brains and brawn.66 min A Chelsea substitution. Former footballer Alvaro Morata is replaced by Olivier Giroud.65 min Schar is rightly booked for taking out Hazard.65 min “Is it just me, or does it seem like Chelsea’s passing is actually very good, just their movement isn’t?” asks Adam Kline-Schoder. “I feel like if they kept up their current rate of passing (if such a thing exists) and just bloody MOVED, they’d create so many opportunities, even against such a strong low block. Could it be that there’s far too strong a dependency on Hazard?”It feels like their passing has been a bit slow, though of course that’s linked to their movement. 62 min A Newcastle substitution: Salomon Rondon is replaced by Joselu.61 min This is comically one-sided. I reckon Newcastle have been out of their half once in the last six or seven minutes.60 min Pedro curls a dangerous cross towards Morata that is crucially headed clear by Schar.56 min Azpilicueta finds Morata in the area, but his touch is heavy and Schar gets across to clear. Morata has been a bit disappointing, and with Newcastle defending so deep, this might be a day for Olivier Giroud.55 min Hazard has been majestic today. It’s such a bonus for Chelsea that he is staying, as they would be pretty ordinary without him.51 min “As Mitrovic continues to bang them in for Fulham, Andy Hinchcliffe posited that if Newcastle fans had been given the choice between Mitro, Rondon and Joselu, most would go for the Serb,” says Shaun Wilkinson. “I agree that most would think that (and I know I do), but a lot would be hesitant to say it as it would mean indirectly admitting that Rafa is not infallible. What’s your opinion? Mitro or Rondon? I am not going to insult you by entertaining the possibility you would choose Joselu.”I haven’t seen much of Mitrovic so I don’t really have an opinion. Rondon is limited but at least he knows those limits and sticks to a fairly simple role.50 min Good save from Dubravka. Hazard plays a brilliant pass to find Pedro on the right of the box. He eases it back to the onrushing Azpilicueta, whose first-time shot is too close to Dubravka.49 min Chelsea have picked up where they left off before half-time. It’s almost painfully one-sided, and yet Newcastle are defending admirably.46 min Peep peep! Chelsea begin the second half, yeah?Chelsea had 79 per cent of the possession in that first half, which must be at least seven tenths of the law. A bit of half-time readingPeep peep! Chelsea have been highly dominant, but Newcastle have restricted them to few clear chances. See you in 15 minutes.45 min Kovacic’s cross is only half cleared to Azpilicueta on the edge of the area. He chests the ball up and fizzes a volley that is accidentally blocked by his team-mate Morata in the six-yard box. I’m not sure whether it was going in or just wide of the far post. Moments later, Hazard is slipped through by Kante. He turns away from the keeper Dubravka but can’t make space for a shot.45 min Hazard is fouled for the 412432432nd time in the match, prompting Kovacic - who was booked a few minutes ago - to enquire as to whether there’s any danger of a Newcastle player being similarly punished.44 min Hazard takes the corner, Diame heads it clear. It’s nodded back in towards Rudiger, whose speculative header drifts a few yards wide of the far post.

Happy Sunday! And here’s Dom Fifield’s report from the Vic.If you need more Canon League Division 1, and frankly who doesn’t, join Rob Smyth for Newcastle United v Chelsea.Holebas says that some words were had a half-time, and that his goal was a cross. Deeney then praises his team’s desire and energy levels, adding that the team are a work in progress, and last season got no points when they played well, so will take points when not playing well this term. Troy Deeney says Watford were “poor by our standards” and got lucky, but their togetherness and will to win hauled them through.Palace might’ve got back into that sooner if they’d changed formation sooner. It wasn’t working for Zaha through the middle, so sending him out wide - and perhaps bringing Meyer on - made sense well before it was done. But looking forward, Meyer might get a start in the next game, because neither McArthur nor Milivojevic played remotely well - the latter, in particular, was anonymous. That’s a great win for Watford, who came back from a sketchy start to dominate the start of the second half and responded well when put under. That’s three from three for them - they’re second in the league and two losses in a row for Palace, who are now 11th.90+6 min ...and here it comes! It picks out Ward beautifully, he’s got a run at it, no defender in sight, he’s going to score, he gets a decent connection, he’s going to be the hero, NO HE ISN’T! The ball skids off his head and wide! 90+5 min Wtfrod have done a really good job of keeping Palace away since going behind, and this time Success runs at them, driving a low shot that’s straight at Hennessey. 90+4 min Off goes “Troooooy Deeney, Watford’s number 9”, who lacks the syllables to make that one work. He’s replaced by Isaac Success. 90+3 min Watford have Palace pinned back here, and Sema takes the ball out on the right, looking to go outside Van Aanholt and drive in a low cross. It’s enough to win his team a corner. 90+2 min Harry the Hornet is whacking a drum. He’d be better off with a triangle. 90+1 min Roy Hodgson is chuntering on the touchline. I’m looking forward to his magnanimity when asked about Capoue only receiving a yellow card for his challenge on Zaha. 90 min There’ll be five added minutes. 89 min Palace win a free-kick down the right and McArthur floats it in! Sorloth’s up! But Kabasele does enough, and the ball skims off his head and away from goal. 88 min I’m not really sure why Roy Hodgson took of a striker for a striker. Sure, you don’t really want a chance falling to Benteke, but just having him there is helpful - one of Watford’s centre-backs would be on him, and the extra striker would create some confusion. 86 min Nice from Palace, who get Ward nashing down the right onto a pass in his stride. Pereyra, though, is having no such thing and yanks him down, riding the inevitable yellow card. 85 min Another miserable afternoon for Benteke comes to and end, replaced by Sorloth. He looks haunted as he takes his seat on the bench. 84 min Watford have responded pretty well to the goal, keeping the ball well away from their penalty box. 83 min Against a defence sitting deep, it probably makes more sense to stick Zaha on the wing, where he can find space, and he’s much harder to pick up bursting in than if he’s already there. Palace need to get the ball to him as much as possible. 81 min Meyer hitchkicks in on Capoue as he pursues his beef with Zaha, earning a booking. This is very nice. Zaha exchanges passes with Meyer, collecting the return close to the by-line, running along it, fading inside, and punching a hardarse finish under and through Hennessey. Here we go! 78 min Nice from Van Aanholt, nipping a ball into Benteke, picking up the return just inside the box, and poking hard with his toe ... Kabasele, who’s played well, does really well to block. 77 min Zaha looks to be paying on the left of a three now - I imagine the plan is for Meyer to support Benteke. But if Palace are looking to cross, they could probably use another body in the box, and don’t have much time to save themselves. “Zaha, Zaha what’s the score,” sing the home fans - the price of being a good player really, grief of people who are nothing to you. 75 min Change for Palace: off goes Schlupp, who’ll be replaced on the left by Meyer. At the moment, he’s on the left, though McArthur expected to move out there. 74 min Watford are pressing for a third here, but then Townsend pinches a loose ball and heads downfield in search of a livener, ducking inside two challenges and inviting the foul. Free-kick Palace, on the left, 25 yards out ... and Milivojevic humps it over the goalline. 73 min Change for Watford: Sema, the summer signing from Ostersunds, replaces Gray, who’s struggled to get into things. Holesbas takes a throw and when it’s headed out, Janmaat is outisde the box to know it back to him. He takes a lovely touch inside Townsend, looks up, and whips in a cross that dips and swerves over Hennessey and into the top corner! The keeper will take plenty of grief for that, but I’m not sure what he could’ve done about that. 69 min And look at that! Sakho smacks a long one at Benteke, who controls beautifully on his chest, makes room with a touch, getting on the half turn as he touch, taking another touch, and whooshing a violent curler onto just wide of the far corner. That’s more like it. 68 min Palace are, though, inching their way into things - it’s been a while since Watford have put anything together - and there’s Zaha coming in from the right, darting a pass into Benteke that Kabasele intercepts. It’s not much but it’s something, and pressure is building.67 min Palace have struggled to get Zaha into the game since the first 10 minutes or so. Perhaps he might go out to the right, because things aren’t working at the moment. 65 min Palace keep it for a bit, moving it nicely, but then Milivojevic looks to slide a pass in between Holebas and Kabasele for Townsend to run onto - the right ball, but a difficult ball, and he puts too much on it. 63 min Palace are missing the balance Wan-Bissaka gives them Ward is a fair replacement, but he lacks the drive and enterprise, and can’t give Townsend the same support. 61 min These last few minutes have been better for Palace and Milivojevic spreads to Townsend, whose cross is deflected behind by Capoue. Townsend then hammers the corner past everyone, unable to come inside onto his other foot. 59 min Palace try and get themselves going, and Benteke attacks the box only to impart a heavy touch. I know! But it’s true! As shocked as you and I, he then imparts a heavy touch on Kabasele’s ankle, for which he is penalised. 58 min Doucoure tries a drag back, but his legs get in the way. Of course they do. 57 min There are a lot of empty seats at Vicarage Road today. I reckon there are also a lot of bored kids in the surrounding area who’d happily have taken a freebie. 55 min “Leftfield candidate for best song opening,” tweets Owen. “The hipster dialogue in House of Blue Lights by Ella Mae Morse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933f8815666551eb0337e4e50a082e05ae3c9e8f/0_2010_3744_2244/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28357407d60e17bcdfd004fd2a0fbeaa","title":"anna maxwell martin ive been bullied by other women in the industry in fact more so than i have by men ","story":"When Anna Maxwell Martin is in a role, you know it’s going to be good, whether it’s Bleak House or Motherland. Here, she talks about her love of acting, industry bullies and why spoilt luvvies need to get over themselvesAnna Maxwell Martin walks into the room, in the heatwave, sits down in a stripy blue dress that crumples all around her, and says she’s going to do this photoshoot in the nude. “Tits out, full frontal – this is it guys,” she says. “First time, this is it. Oh look,” she adds, brightening, as someone brings over a whirring fan, “I can have this for my sexy lady photoshoot, too.”She’s joking, of course, because she’s not that sort of famous. But then, what sort of famous is she? She’s an actor whose name you might not know, but whose face you surely do, from many period dramas (she won the best actress Bafta for Bleak House in 2006) and, most recently, the starring role in the edgy, hysterical BBC2 comedy Motherland, in which she plays a reluctant mother who is always trying to get in with the comically awful parents of her children’s peers. The cult show has slipped into the vernacular: “It’s pure Motherland,” a certain kind of middle-class parent will now mutter as another micro-drama unfolds at the school gates. In casting, Sharon Horgan, the show’s writer, hoped for an actor “who made you laugh but also made you panic inside,” she says. “And Anna does that. She’s one of those actors who’s so naturally gifted she can just switch it on and off. She’s also a little bit nuts, which always helps.”There will be a second and third series of Motherland, but Maxwell Martin doesn’t know when and is breezy about dates – as she seems to be about parenting itself, having grown up near Hull and not been too exposed to the precious yummy-mummy ideals of north London, where she now lives, and which the show lampoons. Rather like her character, she isn’t too bothered about the minutiae of education. She has two young daughters herself. “My nine-year-old didn’t do Sats because she’s dyslexic,” she says, “so they were really sweet about it, but she still seems to be tested all the time, which makes her feel shit – she’s nine! Dyslexic kids are often the loveliest kids – she’s adorable. As long as kids can make eye contact, chat, sit round a table and have a meal with adults – I don’t care about anything else. She says she wants to be a potter and travel around in a VW van with other artists and I say fine. You’re fine.”I mention my own daughter, something that came up in her school report. “She’s six, darling!” she says, in a Yorkshire accent that seems to get stronger the longer we talk. “Who gives a shit? She shouldn’t even be at school!”We are soon in much more serious territory, discussing a forthcoming BBC factual drama called Mother’s Day in which Anna plays Wendy Parry, the Englishwoman whose 12-year-old son was killed by the IRA in the Warrington bomb of 1993. (Do not confuse Motherland with Mother’s Day – they could not be more distinct.) I tell her that I was sent a link to watch a press preview online and, wrapped in a towel at 7am, only clicked on it to check that it worked. I was still sitting there in my towel 90 minutes later when it ended. It got me. She nods, as if this is to be expected.“I haven’t felt this proud of a piece of work for… a long time,” she says, explaining that she can’t bear those TV dramas where we see so much “gratuitous snotting. In a different person’s hands they would have ramped up the whole Colin and Wendy thing, the husband and wife disagreeing about speaking to the press – that would’ve been a big row.” But because the director, Fergus O’Brien, comes from a 20-year background in making documentaries, “it means he doesn’t want to invent some big emotional drama. He says, ‘Just work with what you’ve got.’ And actually, it’s really positive in the end.”There is such a lean economy to the drama that there is only one scene where we see her character overcome with emotion, falling on to a bed. “And that’s it. And I tried to cover my face so you didn’t see any of that.” I suddenly realise why that scene was so compelling: because it wasn’t entirely given to us. Such minimalism is perhaps not the way to the Oscars, but then does Maxwell Martin have those goals? She did try LA for a bit. “I went over, I didn’t really like it. I nearly got a really big movie – a Coen brothers film.” She says she believes in her work, “and I really have a lot of confidence in myself as an actor, but I don’t necessarily have that same confidence in a room full of people, networking at a party. If someone said, ‘Hey, do you want to come down to this really cool party?’ I would probably have said, ‘No, I have cystitis, sorry.’” A wry smile is never far from Maxwell Martin’s face.“Then I got into a family situation very, very early. But again I just – maybe I don’t have enough ambition.” She is married to Roger Michell, who directed Notting Hill, and who had two children before they met. They now have two more children together. I start to say something about her fame and she interrupts me. “I don’t have fame – I’m not famous. I get, ‘Have I met you at playgroup?’ The other day I got,” she puts on a hoiked-bosom home counties accent, ‘Did I play mixed doubles with you at Binningdon tennis courts?’ And I went… ‘No.’ Because I can’t say,” she starts to stage whisper, “‘I’m actually an aac-tresss,’” and then cracks up laughing.Does anybody ever say “Are you Anna Maxwell Martin?”“No! Never. So no, I’m not famous and maybe that’s a good thing. The rule for me is, I will only work on something if a confirmed fun friend is already signed up to it. Who is the Confirmed Fun Friend? OK, I’ll do it.” She laughs. “I’m such a connoisseur, I so believe in the arts,” she says sarcastically, self-mockingly. “Why not? I’m really lucky to do a relatively easy job. I’m not a moaner, and so if I’m going to work, I have to have a good time.” But she quickly changes her tune when she remembers how fascinating she found Boy George on Who Do You Think You Are? “I’m so desperate to be famous enough to go on that programme. I’m literally desperate.” She becomes visibly excited, “I’m Inuit, and they’ve never had an Inuit on that.”Maxwell Martin grew up in Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and went to the local high school. Her mother was a research scientist and her father ran a pharmaceutical company. She started acting when she was a very young kid. “My parents were like, ‘Huh, who are you?’” But this was smalltown Yorkshire and there was no chance of getting on the telly. “I’d never even heard of youth theatre until I came down here. I would have loved to do that, never knew about it. I did go to a drama teacher in Beverley but really we did singing. We’d sing Whitney Houston songs dressed in crop tops. That was it.”She used to get the bus into York with her friend Sal and eat a fat rascal at Bettys, do a bit of shopping, go home. Sal was boaty and wore pearls, “but I was a bit more Slaggy Bev,” she says. They used to sneak into nightclubs, somewhat unaware of how dangerous Hull was at the time, “but often I wouldn’t get in because I looked so young. We all had fake ID but my friends would laugh at me.”That baby face came in handy, though, when she was 25 and played 12-year-old Lyra in His Dark Materials at the National Theatre – her big break. We discuss the joy of ageing (she’s 41), how there’s no point in lying about it.“How hot is Jennifer Lopez? And she’s 49. And so I think she should be going round saying she’s 49,” she says.Yeah but we don’t look like Jennifer Lopez.“Do we not?” she asks. “For the record,” she adds, leaning over and speaking right into my Dictaphone, “I do.”Before attending Lamda in London, Maxwell Martin went to Liverpool University to study history, where she made the group of female friends she has maintained for life, to add to her school friends, and with whom she cried when Geri left the Spice Girls, “but I can’t remember any of my degree. I really was just there to act and make friends and drink Bacardi Breezers. I think I did a lot on the First and Second World Wars, but Roger likes to quiz me about the dates at dinner parties because he knows I don’t know anything. He likes to show me up in a group situation… where I flounder,” she says drolly.As for the current industry upheavals, I ask if she expected to live through the #MeToo movement in her lifetime. There is the longest silence. Then she says quietly, “I think I was really ignorant of what was happening. I have always been a really strong, forthright woman and never considered myself any less than a man, and that’s not out of arrogance. I think that’s just because I was brought up by two nice parents. So I just hadn’t experienced that. Or even if I was sort of lewdly commented on, I have a really good sense of humour and so I can always bat it back. Or even if I was touched up, I could just bat it back. So I didn’t really register the extent of the problem.”She stresses that she is very glad the conversation is now open, “but I just want that slightly moany element taken out, where women are throwing into the pot all stories about sexual indecency and violent rape. Violent rape is very different from having your tits touched. It’s very, very different, and we don’t serve those women with any sense of justice if we lump all these things in together.”About eight years ago she discovered pay inequality, while doing jobs “where I’d be number one on the call sheet and a man would be number three, but he would be on twice my wage. But even when I then raised it with my agent at the time, that was a no-no. Unequal pay seemed like a complete brick wall.” But again, she wasn’t born a luvvie and she can’t bear whining. “When you’re talking about being paid millions of dollars, you cannot moan about it. So let’s move it really quickly into women in all industries who are on zero-hours contracts, women who are exploited all the time in low-wage jobs – because I think we sound slightly like twats in our industry. We have a very charmed life, we get picked up in the morning, driven to work, someone brings us a cup of tea, ‘Where’s this?’, ‘Where’s that?’, ‘The air con’s not working’ – actors can behave very badly and become infantilised very quickly. I am in the loveliest job, I’m paid very well, and then I go home with a driver – I mean really,” she says. That last “really” is said in a tone that expresses full disapproval of the actors making 10 times more than her and complaining 10 times as loudly.She isn’t even sure about pinning all the problems on men. “I’ve been bullied by other women in the industry – in fact more so than I have by men. Undermined, made to feel stupid, when there’s very clear favouritism in the room from a man. Most of the men I’ve worked with are good people who are totally respectful and lovely. There have been a handful who are bastards but also a handful of women who are bastards, too.” She actually calls them the C-word but says not to print it because her mother will be appalled, just like she was when Anna rang her the other day to read out a poem she had written for her friend’s 40th birthday, in which she called her friend an old C. “I like it,” replied her mother, “but I do not like that word.”She has been filming the period drama David Copperfield, directed by Armando Iannucci, in the heatwave “and we’ve been wearing the full corset, then the layers of skirts, one of which is an actual duvet, outside, and it’s 100 degrees. You last five minutes then you rip it off – but oh my God it’s got a brilliant cast. Tilda Swinton’s in it, Dev Patel. He’s brilliant. Ben Whishaw. Daisy May Cooper – oh God I love her, she is just great. Hugh Laurie.” I ask about the resounding popularity of period dramas and she says it is because they are comforting. “Anyone who has acted in a period drama will tell you that it’s the one thing you get people rushing up to you in the street to talk about, even a decade later. People love them – and we haven’t had a cracking one for ages.” This one will be different, though. “Armando has done his thing on it so it’s pretty out there, funny, different. He’s made it ageless and colour-blind – I hate that term, but it works. When you see Dev Patel playing David Copperfield he really is David Copperfield. He has a charm and an innocence about him and I think it’ll be a game-changer. In some ways, after doing Armando’s, I look back on those ones, the all-whitey ones, and I’m a bit like, ‘God, shit, that looks a bit embarrassing now.’ The ones I was in or the other ones, with all-white casts – that looks a bit dumb now. Because it just really didn’t have to be like that.”She is playing a character in the film who’s a man in the book, Mr Strong, “but I’m playing him as Mrs Strong”.So it’s not gender-blind either? You’re not playing a man?“No – I would have loved to have done that. I could have dressed as a man. I would have loved that,” she replies.Why – because it confounds gender expectations and frees you up to enter this whole other realm of acting that has been hitherto unavailable to you?“No! Because I wouldn’t have had to wear the duvet.”Mother’s Day will air in early September on BBC2"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebf12d9f8fb043ff19980c970635d96b8ff0bd9/0_334_5130_3080/master/5130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8940f22ed61f16a64ed7d2bfcf647999","title":"eurasian wolf coming back to europe","story":"The wolf is marching back into western Europe. Now it has reached the tiny Baltic islands of Aland. It is protected by EU law – but who’s protecting the locals? Patrick Barkham reportsEarlier this year, two unexpected guests crossed the sea to reach the largest of the Åland Islands, an archipelago of 6,700 mostly tiny isles between Sweden and Finland. The long, hard winter had frozen the Baltic more extensively than for many a year. A daring few among 30,000 Åland islanders drove their cars over the ice to Finland. In the other direction came two or possibly three wolves.Europe’s most feared carnivore was first seen padding over the sea ice by a ferry passenger in February. When islanders conducted their elk census during the March snows, they found wolf tracks heading west across the main island of Åland, a uniquely autonomous region of Finland. By the start of April a wolf had been sighted. By the end of the month, two were filmed together. In June a sheep was killed with ruthless precision, its skin covered in tooth marks – the work of a wolf, said experts. A few days later, a camera trap set over a carcass captured footage of the chief suspect returning to feed.The Eurasian wolf is marching back into western Europe. It first flourished after the Soviet Union’s collapse, slipping west into Poland, Finland and Germany and then wandering, recolonising densely populated landscapes where it had been absent for a century or more: northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark. People with no memory of living alongside wolves are having to learn how to, because under European Union law the wolf is a protected species. Åland islanders exterminated their last wolf in 1883. But now they want to shoot wolves again, and they are prepared to challenge the EU to do so.During endless summer days, these undulating islands look an improbable site for the wolves’ latest conquest. Surrounded by bright blue water, most islands are minuscule, sun-kissed skerries, where stunted pines grow from crevices in the pink granite. They contain coves of grey sand, little wooden jetties and modest red wooden summer houses. But on the largest (50km by 80km) island there are also dark spruce forests, carpeted with blueberries. And, somewhere, a wolf or two.Most people have retired to their summer houses but a few officials remain hard at work in the government building in the Åland Islands’ tiny capital, Mariehamn.“I am a lonely wolf here,” says Hanna Kondelin, laughing. Kondelin works for the island’s environmental agency, overseeing its plan to tackle the wolves. Islanders, she says, are almost unanimously opposed to the wolves. The naturally secretive animals are now sighted almost every day. Are the wolves seen close to homes? “It’s impossible not to be close to houses and farms because this is a small-scale place,” she says. “We don’t have big forests like they do in Sweden and Finland.” She hears islanders criticising the government for inaction but she and her colleagues have spent “many hours” drawing up a plan.As a conservationist, Kondelin admires the EU Habitats Directive which provides legal protection for rare species, but it is now “causing us quite a lot of headaches”. The Åland Islands must adhere to EU law and are thus legally obliged to protect its wolf population. Finland has run into trouble with the EU in recent years for permitting the seasonal killing of a significant proportion of its 150-strong wolf population. And now Åland’s government wants to go further. It is proposing a system where islanders won’t require a licence before shooting a wolf. Officials say a wolf can only be shot if there is an “immediate” risk of an attack but, under its proposals, an islander could simply retrospectively claim a wolf threatened them or their livestock. “Our politicians are very much agreeing that wolves do not belong here,” says Kondelin. This autumn, she hopes Finland’s government will endorse Åland’s plan. But couldn’t this stance see the islands hauled before the European Court of Justice? “It’s even probable,” she says.Alongside Kondelin is Robin Juslin, a bright young civil servant who heads up the island’s hunting unit. “In almost every household there is a hunter,” says Juslin. “It’s part of the subsistence lifestyle here that you rear your own meat and you hunt and fish.” But the European Commission took the islanders to court over Åland’s spring shoot of 2,000 male eider ducks. Despite the court case, the islanders have restarted the spring shoot, and their dispute with the EU continues. “People thought that the Commission would change their attitudes after Brexit and be more considered about local opinions, but it doesn’t seem that way,” says Juslin. “Now people in Åland are saying ‘exit’. It comes up a lot in the wolf discussion. People in general favour the idea of the EU but the EU can’t take into account the fact that we have had these strong traditions for hundreds of years, and haven’t exterminated the bird population. They can’t trust us to manage our own birds and wolves.”Juslin was visiting Denmark earlier this year when a video emerged of a wolf being illegally shot there. The Danish authorities, he says, “have the same problems as everywhere else. Their government is controlled by the EU and can’t do everything the way that they want. And they can’t get local acceptance for the wolf.”Beyond the tranquillity of Mariehamn, the islands stretch peacefully for miles. Pine forests grow on thick carpets of pale lichens pine cones scattered on pink stone highways are undisturbed by cars. Small fields are squeezed between rocky outcrops potatoes grow well in the sandy, grey soil.Åland is a singular place. Islanders speak Swedish but in 1921 the League of Nations decided it would be part of Finland. Despite ties to Finland, Åland has its own stamps, its own internet domain (.ax) and its own flag, as well as more sunshine hours than anywhere else in northern Europe, a vineyard, a crisp factory and no McDonald’s. It’s within the EU but outside its tax border, and its economy is dependent on duty-free ferries. I take the ferry and people are drinking before 8am. Disco dancing starts at 11am. Many visitors to Åland only see the ferry terminal before hopping on the next ferry back to Sweden or Finland.Åland’s villages are little more than family farms. House martins dip over meadows beside pretty wooden windmills. By a big red barn, beside several long-dead Skodas half-buried in undergrowth, Berit Sjöberg’s five sheepdogs lie obediently on the track. Sjöberg runs an organic farm with 80 ewes. This is her daily routine now: bringing her sheep from pasture to barn each evening because of the wolves. Like everywhere in northern Europe, small farms are going out of business or being agglomerated into large farms. Is it harder to make a living than 20 years ago? “Twenty years!” exclaims Sjöberg. “It’s harder than last year.” This is her toughest season in farming: the grass hasn’t grown during the north European drought, and now there are the wolves. “I take the sheep inside every evening and put them out every morning. I thought it would be OK but I am quite tired. The sheep must be tired of this wolf situation too, because they are getting slower and slower every day. Only the dogs are happy.”What do islanders think about wolves? Sjöberg puts her forefinger across her throat in a slitting motion. “People who like the wolves and would like to have them will say that Åland is not the best place for the wolves,” she says. Conservationists argue that people will tolerate these carnivores if governments fund more shepherding, deterrents (such as big dogs) and wolf-proof electric fencing. But Åland’s rocky terrain gives it paddocks that are small, wild and unfenceable. Ultimately, even if the government provides compensation for wolf kills, Sjöberg argues it never covers the cost of raising the sheep, or the value of its bloodline, or lost future productivity.The wolf has been within 100 metres of Sjöberg’s farm. “I don’t believe he will wait there and not take my sheep,” she says. Can’t people learn to live alongside wolves, as they did in the past? “Yes, maybe there were more predators in the past but there are more people now. We have to save the forest for the wolf but we can’t have the wolf living like this, beside us.”Near the village of Samuelstorp, where a wolf killed a sheep, Börje Jansson is tidying his open-sided wooden barn. “I don’t think the wolf belongs to Åland. It’s too small,” he says. What should islanders do? His wife, Riitta, standing with their four-year-old grandson, is forthright. “Shoot them,” she says. “We haven’t got the space. There is a house every 500m. There are no wild areas. I am scared when my grandchild is here and they attack our neighbour’s sheep.” She thinks the wolf was here the previous day. “Suddenly our two horses became uneasy. It must’ve been something, and then we had to take them in.”The problem, say the Janssons, is that the EU’s rules are too broad for small and unusual places such as Åland. “They can’t make a rule and include every country because we’re all so different, with different circumstances,” says Riitta. “When the shooting season here starts in the autumn, if the wolves come, they are going to shoot it.”Börje makes a grave face. “It would then be murder,” he says. “We can go to prison!” exclaims Riitta, eyes wide at what she sees as the ridiculousness of this situation.Is anyone in favour of the wolf? “No, I don’t think so,” Börje smiles. “In Helsinki, maybe.”Opposition to the Åland Islands’ determination to shoot their wolves has indeed come from conservationists in Helsinki. “There should be space for wolves on Åland, there are lots of roe deer for them,” says Sami Säynevirta of Luonto-Liitto, a Finnish wildlife charity. “Killing a wolf should be a last resort. They should try other alternatives, like trying to scare a wolf away or building an electric fence. There should not be any exceptions for the Åland Islands.” Säynevirta suggests relocating the Åland wolves, ideally to Sweden, where ecologists are concerned that its wolf population is becoming inbred because the wolves’ route from Finland to Sweden is blocked by Lapland. There are no wolves in Lapland because they are shot to protect reindeer-herding in the region.According to Guillaume Chapron, associate professor in ecology at Sweden’s University of Agricultural Sciences, our notion of the wolf as an icon of wilderness and best-suited to wild areas is profoundly wrong. “The reason we say the wolf is a creature of wilderness is that the only place where we couldn’t easily eradicate them was in the wilderness. That was the only place they could survive. Then we made the emotional association – wolf equals wilderness. This artificially restricts the wolf, keeping it in areas where there are no people.”In fact, says Chapron, we should consider the wolf to be like a carnivorous roe deer, or a big fox – it’s an adaptable species that lives everywhere from Israeli deserts to the high Arctic. Wolf territories are dependent on food supply and the 750sq km of the Åland Islands might be big enough for a few territories, according to Chapron. “At the same time, I don’t want to be more royalist than the king,” he says. “If there were no people on these islands, we would have some wolves but would we really have more than two or three inbred packs? From an ecological point of view, it’s difficult to imagine a thriving Åland wolf population. The future of the wolf here is probably regular solitary animals passing by in the winter.”Chapron believes the relevance of Åland’s struggle with the wolf is not whether its newcomers survive or are slaughtered but whether the islanders’ approach becomes a template for the rest of Europe. Increasingly, he says, there is an assumption that predator populations have gone “too far” and proactive measures must be taken before wolves damage our best economic interests. Germany’s new coalition agreement includes a provision to ask the European Commission to review the protection of the wolf and bring about a “necessary” population reduction. “We don’t want ideas from Åland recolonising Europe,” says Chapron. “I don’t see why we need to reduce the population size of the wolf. We are stuck on a very low baseline. We almost eradicated the wolf and now there’s a modest recovery. Finally, we have a conservation success – predators are back. What’s the first thing the politicians start to talk about? Reduce the population.”Every islander I meet says the same thing: Åland is too small for the wolf. I’m sure I won’t find a single pro-wolf islander. Finally, I reach the Åland Hunting and Fishing Museum near the faded wooden fishing sheds of Käringsund. Inside stands an enormous taxidermised elk, a wall of taxidermised eider ducks and a taxidermised wolf, commemorating the last beast shot on the islands. There’s a net, too, that shows how the wolves were hunted to extinction here: a big hole was dug in the ground and covered by the net before a gang of islanders harried the wolves towards their trap.“I think it’s really interesting to find that people are still so afraid of the wolf, even though islanders haven’t met them since 1883,” says the museum manager, Åsa Hägg. Amazingly, in this sea of dead animals, I find a wolf enthusiast. “That’s because I’m a biologist,” says Hägg. “I think it’s good that we get new species. Of course there are a lot of sheep farmers and I can understand their fear, getting sheep killed by the wolf.”The last Åland lynx was shot in 1910 but in 2012 lynx were seen again on the island a few now appear to be living here, preying on the island’s thriving population of introduced wild roe deer. “When the lynx came back, it was, ‘Oh God, it is going to kill all the roe deer,’” says Hägg. “Now with the wolves it’s, ‘Oh God, it is going to kill all the sheep.’” She wonders whether her fellow islanders might live alongside wolves as Alaskans live alongside wolves and bears. But she fears they won’t.“I don’t think a wolf population is possible with the farmers here,” she says. “I have noticed the more we urbanise, the further we get from nature and the forest. In the past, they lived closer to nature and they knew it better. When we don’t have knowledge about nature and the forest and the animals, we get more afraid.”Germany There was broad public acceptance for Germany’s burgeoning wolf population after a public education programme for children and the introduction of ‘wolf commissioners’ who provided farmers with electric fences and guard dogs. But the latest coalition agreement includes a pledge to regulate the wolf population – currently against EU policy.Denmark A wolf pack arrived in Denmark for the first time in more than 200 years in 2017 when a young female wolf padded 500km from Germany. But one wolf was illegally shot dead last May.Belgium The last mainland European country to have no wild wolves finally recorded a wolf in January this year when Naya, a female from Germany, reached Flanders via The Netherlands.UK Britain’s last wolf was officially killed in 1680 in Killiecrankie, but one hunter claimed to see a Highland wolf in 1888. Rewilders want to reintroduce them farmers and most landowners are fiercely opposed. An exception is Paul Lister of Alladale wilderness reserve in the Highlands. He hopes to release wolves into a fenced area of 50,000 acres.USA After a 70-year absence, 41 wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone Park in 1995-7. By 2015, there were more than 500 in the greater Yellowstone area. A popular video credits wolves with reshaping rivers, but scientists say wolves’ ‘ecosystem engineering’ is not quite so simple."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de949cda802f3e9904ba5540fc70bf276d01da0/0_200_5605_3363/master/5605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d498efb660239c4ddb89f55a4771ede","title":"coastal hideaway former pub in kent","story":"A sauna, sunroom and snug all add to the warm welcome for family and guests at a coastal hideawayFor me, a sauna was always a must,” says Alex Bagner. We’re peering into what was once the outdoor privy of a Victorian fisherman’s pub. “It’s a bit of a DIY job, but it works.” Bagner was born in Stockholm and has transposed the Swedish bathing ritual – an ice-cold dip followed by a stint in the sauna – to Kingsdown on the coast of Kent. “We do it all year round. People think we’re mad, but it’s starting to catch on.”Alex and her husband, Chris, bought the Victory as a holiday home eight years ago. Chris’s great-grandfather owned the local Walmer brewery, and his mother grew up here, so they had a connection to the area and the Victory, once owned by the brewery. The pub served its last pint in the 1950s, but for many years it sat next door to the Zetland Arms, which is still open. “In that pure Kent way, I guess they thought, the more the merrier,” says Bagner.The house is at the end of a private road that runs parallel to Kingsdown beach. A footpath spiked with blackberry bushes and wild fennel separates the row of fisherman’s cottages, bungalows and grand Edwardian houses from the shingle beach. In front, a line of unassuming beach huts faces the English Channel. “When we first started coming here it really was quite different,” Bagner recalls. “The Zetland Arms was deserted. On winter days, it felt like the end of the earth here. That was before High Speed 1 and Airbnb changed things quite dramatically.”The couple, who now have three children, lived with the house for four years, “fiddling around until it was really falling apart”. They figured out how they wanted to use it before renovation work began. “We’re both into entertaining and hosting – not in a big showy way, but our house is always quite full. That’s how we’ve always lived.” The cottage now sleeps 11, in four bedrooms. (There’s a double bunk bed on the ground floor, two doubles on the first floor and a family room in the attic.) Wood panelling, narrow passageways and white floorboards mean it still retains “that cottagey sense”.On the ground floor they extended out into what was the pub garden, creating a generous kitchendining room that faces the beach. What was the kitchen is now a snug TV room with a huge log burner for warming up damp beachgoers. Above the kitchen, connected to the main bedroom, is an aluminium-framed sunroom furnished with mismatched chairs and sofas. A battered midcentury leather sofa and Ercol day bed are strewn with sun-faded cushions and a pair of cocktail chairs recovered in Sanderson fabric faces the sea. “The sun comes up right here, so this is where we sit with coffee and the papers,” says Bagner. “The rug is normally covered with Lego and furniture from the doll’s house.”From the sunroom, Bagner points out the boat her eight-year-old son has just bought. Last summer he raised £200 by setting up a little shop on the footpath selling painted stones, homemade ice cream and lemonade to passers-by. “I’m not sure it’ll ever be seaworthy, but he takes himself off there to read,” says Bagner. “He wants to rename it Mayhem, but I’ve heard it’s bad luck to change the name.”Upstairs, the hallway was reconfigured to accommodate an extra staircase leading to the converted attic. A double bed fits snugly into the new dormer, which overlooks protected woodland, the end of Kingsdown beach and beyond to the white cliffs of Dover. On the other side of the bannister, a partition wall separates the double bed from the two singles opposite: an idea suggested by a friend, Nicola Harding, of the interior design practice Harding and Read.Harding also advised on the colour palette for the cottage, suggesting Farrow \u0026amp Ball’s Setting Plaster for the panelled hallway, Blue Ground for the pocket doors and stairway woodwork and Oval Room Blue for the master bedroom. “This was when choosing different colours for every room was still quite a new thing,” says Bagner. “At the time, I remember thinking, ‘Really? Not just white?’” But she held her nerve and the result is a lively interior that feels very personal despite the house being occupied year-round by mini-breakers.It’s a handsome, three-storey building revived with rich colours, glowing velvets and locally sourced vintage furniture. “It’s eclectic and fun and full of things we like,” says Bagner. Happily, it’s a combination others are drawn to. Hen parties, young families, locals and “DFLs” (Down From Londoners) fill the bar and restaurant – “in that pure Kent way”.

He said he had no romantic feelings for me, which of course I accepted. Fast forward to now. I recently wrote to him asking for some help with my PhD idea. We messaged each other over it for about an hour and a half. Nothing wrong with that – but I noticed a few hours later that half the messages we exchanged were deleted by him. The content was flirty. He has a girlfriend but it’s complicated. What I don’t get is why did he delete the messages? It’s not unusual for us to be flirty. What’s going on?Mariella replies  Do you really need me to tell you? I’ve realised after two decades in the job (yes, yes, slow learner I know!) that often people write to me so I can spell out clearly what they already suspect but aren’t ready to accept. You certainly back up my theory, as the first part of your letter pretty succinctly sums up what’s causing the problems outlined in the latter half of it.It’s fair enough for me to be cast as the baddie, sitting here, emotionally removed, making my pronouncements on the lives of others. But perhaps that’s exactly why, two decades later, people are still writing. Advice from a stranger comes with an absence of judgment that’s hard to access from a close friend and hopefully makes the unpalatable element of self-realisation that bit less of a personal attack. If you don’t like what I have to say, you can conclude that I’ve misinterpreted you, or failed to understand the nuances of your situation because I don’t know you. I’m sure on occasion that’s a fair assumption, but on a good day what you’ll get back from this column is confirmation that what you suspect is the reality.The closer you are to someone, the harder it is not to use your privileged knowledge of them to offer wisdom based on the person you judge your friend to be. Our interpretation of relationships, like history, depends a lot on who is recounting the story. Laying your emotional life bare to a total stranger has to have some advantages. I don’t know you, I can’t use past history against you or form a prognosis based on it and so, in the best of cases, have an unimpeded picture of what’s being ulged.I answer only what I’m asked by my correspondents and on occasion that causes ire. I understand such misgivings but I also feel that mine is a privileged and advantageous vantage point. Ironically it’s far easier to find a clear path in complicated emotional territory from a stranger than during a night of wine-fuelled confessions with a close friend. Friends are a great sounding board but most of us turn in times of need to the one we hope will tell us what we want to hear.When you write to me you have no such luxury, but there is the possibility that the process of setting down your dilemma and having it evaluated on that basis will offer confirmation of what you already know, deep in your heart. Friends and family can be compromised by their knowledge of us and although past mistakes can provide great learning opportunities, at other times they merely muddy the water.You probably won’t like me for what I’m about to say but I’m sure you’ll come to see that there was no other way to read your dilemma. You and this male friend have been admirably honest with each other, which is to both your credit, even if on your part your admission was by mistake. It’s terrifying to own up to having feelings for someone we already know, braving the possibility that the relationship may be damaged beyond repair. He certainly didn’t string you along, which can be judged as either a chivalric or cowardly choice, depending on how forgiving your nature.Your mate has been crystal clear and I hope you expressed appreciation to him for honouring you with his honesty. Now, time has passed and yet you seem to be wishing it had stood still. When the possibility of a romance has been broached and rejected, the time for flirty emails also passes.You say this man’s relationship with his girlfriend is complicated, offering that as an excuse for why a flirtation isn’t unreasonable, but it won’t be improved by your emotionally convoluted interchanges. I imagine he’s deleted your conversations because they allude to a form of relationship he doesn’t want with you and doesn’t want to have to justify to her. Either way the signal he’s sending loud and clear is that yours is a platonic friendship and he is otherwise preoccupied.I know that’s hard to accept and the very nature of love is to inspire hope and optimism in the unrequited lover. We both know that you are lingering when you should have moved on and this man, if he’s to remain your friend, needs to stop being reminded that you wished otherwise. Advice on your PhD is a perfectly good reason to be in touch but not if you’re still scrutinising every word from him for potential weakening of his desire to keep things platonic. Let’s be frank with each other: if you can’t accept what he is offering then you should be seeking advice, academic and otherwise, from other quarters. Thanks for writing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f1bd1bc4b552a4338cc0cce09f2e3d53f6dc2e/0_228_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40e48d7d96c7e2b2e90d802939bdf01a","title":"unlike on screen dads i can hold a baby the real horror is in my head","story":"Feckless film dads are neither accurate nor interesting. The reality of fatherhood is seeing every new toy as a life-threatening weaponOne of the big surprises about having a baby is how amazing I am at it, compared to the world’s most famous men. Like so many others, a fair bulk of my expectations about fatherhood came from screen portrayals of feckless dads. These posit that babies are near impossible for men to supervise for more than 45 seconds at a time, difficult to even hold without them squirming and spraying like a startled squid. You will know this if you have watched a cinematic depiction of a man changing or feeding a baby for the first time, during which you’d be forgiven for thinking it was also the first time he had ever used his own hands.You can see the montage in your head already. Tom Selleck grimaces as he opens a nappy. Seth Rogen squints in horror at the instructions for a crib and Michael Gambon ends up showered in turds while wearing a nappy on his head. All of this repeats until Arnold Schwarzenegger collapses, weeping, in a heap of talcum powder, plastic wrapping and not-yet-dried baby piss.Later, Channing Tatum’s wife returns home to find that beautiful lunk she married, passed out in the cartoonish pile of plastic bottles he’s crushed with his big, muscular arse. Her husband, Zac Efron, still holds his phone on a snoring chest, its last Google search - ‘What is a baby?’ – dimly illuminating the gentle dark. What’s important, she thinks, is that her darling Charles Laughton has done his best: he’s looked after a child for half an afternoon, and both have survived.In reality, changing and bottle feeding are neither remotely difficult nor particularly unpleasant, just repetitive and, over time, a bit boring. Depicting this stuff as uniquely and inherently difficult for men bears the implication that we are stupid and, more insidious still, that parenting really should be left to women. Neither is accurate, or more importantly, interesting.It’s not like the horrors of fatherhood are difficult to find. I cringed through the boy’s first days, dementing myself over every ill that could befall him. All the cutesy things we bought have now taken on the appearance of spinning, skin-piercing choke hazards. This is because every object on Earth is now a spinning, skin-piercing choke hazard.Buttons might as well be Stanley knives, and keys shrapnel from a hand grenade. A cousin bought a stuffed rabbit so luxuriantly soft it’s almost a gas, and I spent 20 minutes imagining its small, hard nose bursting his perfect little eye. This pattern kept repeating me receiving a harmless item manufactured specifically for children, and reacting like I’d been posted a nail bomb dusted with Sars.I want to see Ryan Gosling, wracked with thoughts about his sleeping daughter swallowing her entire blanket and pillow set. Or Paul Rudd, unable to step within five metres of a window because he imagined his son being snatched from outside by a passing, stilt-wearing thief. Until then, screen dads will have to settle for being clueless dolts a hapless cohort of idiots being literally, and figuratively, shat on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a0082deec05d5044877a3c6c056df7670a04d4/0_0_1960_1180/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1d5c18036e12c668799fa9229ccbaf","title":"greece in 10 audiobooks a listeners literary guide","story":"Myths, magic and mandolins feature in these stories about one of Europe’s oldest and grandest culturesIf you’re planning a summer vacation to Greece, the good news is it’s hard to get it wrong. From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The move comes at a time when the company faces multiple investigations into its affairs in Europe.The Competition and Markets Authority warned the company in April that it was risking legal action for suspected breaches of consumer law, and National Trading Standards launched a separate investigation into “misleading” pricing just days later.A source familiar with developments at Viagogo told the  the company began notifying senior staff in London of plans to move their jobs to New York in May. “Several senior developers have already relocated, but they’re mostly people that have been at Viagogo since nearly day one and so are probably invested in the company,” said the source. “A few others are moving in the next couple of months, and others are leaving very soon.”A recruitment page on Viagogo’s website features multiple job adverts seeking staff to join its New York team, as well as some for other parts of the world.But the company is not recruiting for its office on London’s Fenchurch Street, where nearly 100 staff worked in customer services and website development last year, according to Companies House filings.The progress of the CMA and Trading Standards investigations is not expected to be affected by Viagogo moving staff overseas. But it could make life more difficult for MPs seeking to persuade Viagogo executives to attend a select committee hearing scheduled for next month.The company, whose headquarters are in Switzerland, refused to attend a hearing last year, in an almost unprecedented snub to a parliamentary committee. A spokesperson declined to say whether the company would attend the new evidence session.Sources in the ticket touting world told the  that Viagogo has also started paying them for their sales through a US company rather than Viagogo AG, its Swiss head office.Payments now arrive from Viagogo Entertainment Inc, registered in the US state of Delaware, which is known for its financial secrecy.Delaware is also the location of Viagogo’s ultimate parent company, Pugnacious Endeavors, which is owned by founder Eric Baker.The changes are thought to herald an expansion into US, where ticket resale has attracted less public criticism than in the UK and Europe.Baker co-founded rival ticket resale firm StubHub in the US, after realising the huge potential for “secondary ticketing”, where people can resell tickets for gigs and sporting events online.Most secondary ticketing sites claim they are simply providing a service for fans to recoup money for tickets they no longer want or can’t use.But they have been criticised for providing a platform for professional touts who harvest tickets in bulk when they go on sale, in order to resell them at a vast mark-up.The Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into suspected breaches of consumer law by secondary ticketing sites last year. It later singled out Viagogo for failing to bow to its demand to comply with consumer laws about information provided to customers, warning the company it faced legal action if it did not comply with demands to make changes.The Advertising Standards Authority referred Viagogo to National Trading Standards earlier this year over “misleading” pricing information.Switzerland’s secretariat for economic affairs launched civil proceedings against Viagogo over suspected unfair business practices last year, while Fifa lodged a criminal complaint against the company over unauthorised sale of tickets for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Viagogo has elicited fierce criticism in the UK on multiple occasions, including a call from digital minister Margot James to boycott the company.As well as investigations by the CMA and Trading Standards, the site has faced accusations of “callous profiteering” from charity events. It has also been accused of withholding refunds from consumers, while a  investigation revealed that touts were using the site to resell football tickets, which is illegal in the UK.With scrutiny of secondary ticketing intensifying, Ticketmaster has said it would shut its own resale sites, GetMeIn and Seatwave, leaving StubHub and Viagogo as the only major players in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02cec286c7e1c65e2ecdeb045af06b9dcf5de0e/121_426_4876_2926/master/4876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5aa2bb6d364d6b660adc6f608017a2d","title":"best photos of the day flying f1 car storm surfer","story":"’s picture editors bring you photo highlights from around the world including a dramatic crash at Spa, the Pope’s visit to Ireland and the Notting Hill carnival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4671a58f90fa0ce003d006dabf59084b411b0ce2/153_326_5074_3044/master/5074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f2bbcc0ff2e92f830f16952115860f3","title":"have people inspected at irish border after brexit says jacob rees mogg","story":"Critics deride suggestion of return to arrangements ‘as we had during the Troubles’Jacob Rees-Mogg has sparked a fresh row about the status of the Irish border after Brexit after a video emerged in which he suggests a return to checks “as we had during the Troubles”.The Conservative MP is seen on the footage from the public meeting suggesting the government could “keep an eye on” the border.“Ireland would not be a free for all. It would be perfectly possible to continue with historic arrangements to ensure that there wasn’t a great loophole in the way people can get into the UK, to leave us in as bad a position as we are already in,” Rees-Mogg says.“There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It’s not a border that everyone has to go through every day, but of course for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border, to try and stop gun-running and things like that.”The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was sharply critical of his comments. “This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland,” he said.Rees-Mogg has previously been criticised for saying he did not need to visit Northern Ireland to understand the challenges Brexit posed for communities on the border.His comments, earlier this year, were described as arrogant and judgmental by people living there. In an interview with BBC Northern Ireland, he said: “I don’t think my visiting the border is really going give me a fundamental insight into the border beyond what one can get by studying it.”The Sinn Féin politician Mártín Ó Muilleoir, South Belfast MLA, said Rees-Mogg’s comments on the border after Brexit showed “contempt and complete disregard for the people of Ireland north and south, through the ridiculous suggestion of a ‘technological border’.“Anyone labouring under the misapprehension that the Tories care a jot about the north is living in a fool’s paradise.”The status of the Irish border remains one of the toughest sticking points in the UK’s negotiations on a withdrawal agreement with the EU.Theresa May has said no UK prime minister could accept the EU’s proposal, for Northern Ireland effectively to remain in the customs union and the single market, with the rest of the UK outside – requiring a border in the Irish Sea.The EU for its part regards Britain’s solution of a “facilitated customs arrangement”as unworkable.The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, acknowledged on Friday that the October deadline once regarded as the end-date for the Brexit negotiations could now slip to November.Tensions among senior Conservatives in cabinet were also exposed at the weekend, as the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, played down the significance of Treasury forecasts suggesting a no-deal Brexit would blow an £80bn hole in public finances.“I’m always wary of any forecast, because most of them have been proved to be wrong,” he told the Sunday Times.As May battles to complete a deal, Rees-Mogg is leading a vocal group of Conservative MPs calling on the party to “chuck Chequers”, the negotiating position painstakingly agreed by cabinet at their July awayday.They are keen to play down the significance of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which they believe has driven the logic of the push toward a softer Brexit.Boris Johnson told MPs in his resignation speech, after he rejected the Chequers deal: “We allowed the question of the Northern Irish border, which had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble, to become so politically charged as to dominate the debate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aa79b9567452dc74bd8ab4ed201851bc41133c6/0_122_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83821c47cb579b2c805386c8546d23d0","title":"vince cable radical reforms lib dems","story":"Allies deny reports party leader will trigger leadership contest next monthVince Cable has told his MPs he will not remain Liberal Democrat leader in the long term, but hopes to push through radical reform of his party’s rulebook before stepping aside.Cable is due to make a speech on 7 September, a week before party members gather for their annual conference in Brighton.He is expected to outline proposals for sweeping changes to his party’s rules, including introducing a new category of registered supporter, similar to the hundreds of thousands who signed up to back Jeremy Corbyn in Labour’s 2015 leadership contest.Another rule change under consideration is to allow non-MPs to stand for the party’s leadership – a measure that would spark speculation about whether Cable wants to make the Lib Dems a vehicle for realignment of the centre ground in British politics.Allies denied reports that Cable would use the occasion to trigger a leadership contest in the near term, saying that he would not announce a date. They did acknowledge, however, that while Cable would continue as party leader for an early general election – if Theresa May is forced to call one next year, for example – he would be unlikely to stay on until 2022, when the next general election is due if parliament runs its course.Other Lib Dem sources suggested there was a widespread assumption, including among MPs, that Cable would step down once Britain had left the EU. Some MPs believe his authority will start to drain away once it becomes clear he plans to step aside.Cable was business secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government. He lost his Twickenham seat in 2015, but regained it in last year’s general election, and took over as party leader from Tim Farron.Farron, who remains an MP, stepped aside in the aftermath of last year’s general election after he was repeatedly pressed during the campaign about his personal beliefs on issues including homosexuality. That year the Lib Dems performed below expectations in what many thought would be a Brexit-focused campaign, returning 12 MPs against the eight of two years earlier.Cable has made keeping Britain in the EU the centrepiece of his policy platform, calling for an “exit from Brexit”. He has also made speeches on other major policy issues, including suggesting a breakup of giant tech companies. Some activists, however, express private concern about his low media profile.The former energy secretary Ed Davey could stand in a future leadership contest, after declining to do so last year for family reasons. Cable’s well-regarded deputy, Jo Swinson, who is currently on maternity leave, is also widely seen at Westminster as a potential successor.Daisy Benson, the party’s former prospective parliamentary candidate for Yeovil, highlighted the Lib Dems’ gains in May’s local elections, in which they took councils including Richmond and Kingston in London, and said she welcomed reforms that could broaden the party’s supporter base.“Our council results are really excellent, but we do need to be a lot more ambitious,” she said.The package of party reforms under consideration has been partly inspired by Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party in Canada. Trudeau broadened his party’s supporter base as he swept to power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9063f875855c73042052054c064f123f3171c624/0_136_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=280222ab96db1c35e4821854224a8fe6","title":"paralympian left stranded on stansted flight after staff delay","story":"Anne Wafula Strike had to wait on board her disembarked flight for 45 minutes despite having booked assistanceParalympian and disability rights campaigner Anne Wafula Strike was left stranded at Stansted airport on her return from the world para athletics European championships in Berlin after airport staff failed to meet her flight to take her off the plane.She said that being abandoned on the plane left her “profoundly distressed”.“As a wheelchair user, it’s very frustrating and caused me great inconvenience to be forgotten and stuck on a plane,” she stated. “It also meant that other passengers were held up too. Not good at all. As a disability rights campaigner, I feel that this is an area that needs serious attention. It is happening to far too many disabled travellers.”Wafula Strike was left on board Ryanair flight 146 from Berlin to Stansted after her journey home to Harlow following the championships in Berlin. Her flight had been delayed due to earlier storms in the south of Italy where the plane had been on another flight. It left Berlin late, and landed at Stansted just before 9pm on Friday evening almost two hours after it was scheduled to arrive.There was a delay of 20 minutes before the doors opened at Stansted but once all the passengers had got off the plane, Wafula Strike was left on the aircraft with Ryanair cabin crew after previously having booked assistance at the airport several weeks before she travelled.Wafula Strike, who had to wait for around 45 minutes for ground staff to arrive to help her off, said: “Being left alone on the plane after all the hassles of flight delays and depriving myself of fluids to avoid needing to go to the toilet, I felt neglected and desperate as well as profoundly distressed.“My other worry was whether or not my wheelchair was OK. Was this incident just a mistake or was it negligence and sheer lack of care for disabled passengers?Wafula Strike received media coverage last year when she went public about an accessible toilet on a train being out of order, forcing her to wet herself because she was on a long journey.That incident happened in December 2016 and involved a three hour train journey from Nuneaton, also to Stansted Airport.Following the incident, for which she received compensation from the train company, she was asked by then transport minister Paul Maynard to advise on how to make transport more accessible for people with disabilities.Wafula Strike was awarded an MBE for her services to disability sport and is a board member of UK Athletics as well as the patron of several disability charities. She said the train incident completely robbed her of her dignity.When Wafula Strike was finally taken off the plane she was forced to wait more than an hour in the luggage hall before she could retrieve her luggage – longer than the duration of the Berlin to Stansted flight.“I had to cancel two taxis that had been pre-booked, then was forced to pay for another taxi,” she said.The BBC’s Frank Gardner has been stranded on flights at Heathrow Airport twice in the last six months because of failures of airport ground staff to help him off the plane.Dr Philippa Whitford, SNP MP and surgeon, tweeted: “This is shocking. Travel is about expanding our world. Do Ryanair and Stansted airport think that should not be available to those with mobility issues?”Wafula Strike lodged a complaint with Ryanair on Saturday and received an automated acknowledgment from the airline.A spokesperson for the airport said: “We are disappointed to hear about Anne’s experience at Stansted on Friday evening. We are in the process of investigating how such a situation arose and have asked Omniserv, the company responsible for looking after passengers with reduced mobility, for a full explanation of why Anne had to wait for such a long time on the aircraft.“On Friday evening, bad weather across Europe unfortunately resulted in significant delays to some aircraft landing at Stansted and had a knock on impact on the baggage handling delivery times for a number of our passengers.”Ryanair has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12113265cbeff61dcee3af7817422a6a67a6bf47/0_441_3364_2017/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9c873729ee8f59aa9d29bbe5f818093","title":"chris boyd influence shaking up northampton premiership rugby","story":"Fresh approach of Northampton’s new coach may inspire others to speed up the pace of change in the PremiershipThere have been some eye-catching additions to the Premiership this summer, even if the clubs have generally avoided splurging as they grapple with mounting debts.Bristol have recruited the league’s first £1m-a-year player, Charles Piutau, and invested in what is left in the legs of the Wallabies flanker George Smith. Gloucester have fortified themselves with a clutch of signings from the Golden Lions, the former home of their coach, Johan Ackermann Wasps have replaced Danny Cipriani with the All Black Lima Sopoaga and Sale will have Chris Ashton watching from the stands for a while. But the most intriguing signing – one that could influence the competition as a whole – looks to be a coach.Northampton, whose success earlier this decade was based on the staple English diet of set-piece supremacy, gainline domination, power and accurate kicking have hired Chris Boyd, who in 2016 steered the Hurricanes to the Super Rugby title.The Saints in their pomp had a fly-half who was comfortable operating in a structured environment, Stephen Myler. Boyd’s pivot in Wellington was Beauden Barrett, a player who revels in chaos. Boyd’s move to Franklin’s Gardens may not quite be equivalent to Pep Guardiola taking over a long-ball team but it amounts to a significant change in direction, one that could have benefits across the Premiership, which last season was slow to react to the change in the game’s zeitgeist from set pieces and possession to the breakdown and turnovers.Boyd was on Wales’s shortlist to replace Warren Gatland after next year’s World Cup but would not wait that long to make the move to Europe. “I talked to them but I wanted to go straight into a position after finishing with the Hurricanes and I was keen to coach in the Premiership as well, a tournament I have always regarded highly,” he says. “I am a bit of a rugby tragic and have always followed the game in the northern hemisphere closely. The game is different here in the way it is played and refereed, stuff I have to get used to. Having been in Wellington for 30 years or so, apart from a stint with Tonga and a high-performance unit, I wanted to see how I would go working with people who were new to me.“There is a whole melting point and we have to find the right way to play with the group we have. I would be surprised if the risk and reward did not go up a wee bit from where it has been. It won’t be a traditional Northampton way and it won’t be a traditional Hurricanes way: you would be foolish to dismiss the importance of set pieces in England, where it is more than a means of restarting play as we regard it in New Zealand. Your philosophy must suit the cattle you have. I have not encountered a closed mind here and that is heartening.”Boyd replaces Jim Mallinder, who was sacked last December after a 10-year career at the club that started when Saints were in the Championship and took in a European Cup final and a Premiership title. As Northampton declined, the board felt he was owed time to get the team back where they were. Misplaced loyalty? “No,” says the Saints’ chief executive, Mark Darbon. “The impact Jim had here was immeasurable and it was right to give him the opportunity to turn results around. It did not happen and we reacted at the right time.“Chris was at the top of our list to replace him and his impact has been visible. His philosophy is different to Jim’s and I think you will see a slightly different style of play but a new coach always has to be given time.”Time will be precious. Relegated London Irish have been replaced by Bristol, who look unrecognisable from their last visit to the Premiership two years ago, and not just because they have become the Bears.Northampton at one point last season were on course to finish one off the bottom before scrambling to ninth. If they look to have too much experience and pedigree to be sucked into a relegation battle, Worcester look more vulnerable, Harlequins need to tighten up under Paul Gustard and Bath, who will be without the England backs Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph for the start of the season, have an underwhelming feel.Their opening match is at Bristol on Friday, when Ashton Gate will be close to its 26,500 capacity. Bath lost there two seasons ago, their West Country rivals’ last victory in the top flight, and the Bears are a different beast now. “Rebranding puts the club on a new footing,” says Bristol’s owner, Stephen Lansdown, whose £1.7bn fortune has spooked rivals who do not want the lid on wage inflation blown off, just when the salary cap has been frozen at £7m until a review in 2020.“Things in sport have tended to be done in a certain way but you have to change, as the game and society have. When we were promoted last time, I thought people would come back and watch us but we had been out of the top flight for eight years: people had forgotten what it was like and we did not appreciate what was required. Too often a business rests on its laurels and does not push on, but we are not standing still now.“I will continue to look to make top-notch signings like Charles Piutau, supplementing them with academy products because we want to become sustainable. There is a lot of excitement around the place.”There was plenty of excitement last season for Saracens. The champions have only three recruits and Exeter, the runners-up, one, both trusting their academies. The two clubs were some way ahead of the rest last season it is no coincidence that following Mallinder’s dismissal by Northampton, they have the Premiership’s longest-serving coaches, followed by the other teams who made the play-offs last season: Wasps, Newcastle and Sale.Leicester, for so long a byword for continuity, reacted to their descent by suddenly hiring and firing two seasons ago. Simon Cohen, their chief executive, says: “I do not think the reason we have not been as competitive over the last few years is down to money. We need to get some stability within our coaching group.”Leicester remain the Premiership’s best-supported club and have plans to build a hotel and car park on land adjacent to their ground but their construction needs to be on the field in the second half of a year when England have juddered and the Premiership clubs have struggled in Europe.Boyd’s arrival should prove timely for Eddie Jones as the England coach strives for a high-tempo, reactive game. If the quality of rugby in the Premiership can sometimes be questioned, the effort of players cannot. A hope this season is that the sides prepared to indulge in risk are given more licence by refereeing interpretations. Colour is a way for clubs to get into the black."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/080058baf2294127858d2bc944c015ad9aca75e2/0_96_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62ea1e52d0b302c3fececa1bfbf58870","title":"england target opening top order jonny bairstow india sri lanka","story":"Move to turn wicketkeeper-batsman into a specialist batsman may have to wait until the tours to Sri Lanka and West IndiesEveryone can lament the margin of England’s defeat at Trent Bridge but maybe not the outcome itself. Beyond the dressing rooms the idea of any side taking a 3-0 lead in a five-match series is stultifying. So, as the circus descends on the Ageas Bowl, the series is alive with England 2-1 up and only a fool can regard the result of the fourth Test as a foregone conclusion. All the pointers led to an England victory at Nottingham and they lost by 203 runs. There is plenty to excite.Thursday’s match is the third Test to be played at Hampshire’s out-of-town ground. The first, in 2011, against Sri Lanka was a rain-interrupted draw England won the second against India in 2014 by 266 runs.Then Moeen Ali took eight wickets in a high-scoring match, in which Gary Ballance and Ian Bell hit big hundreds. It was Jos Buttler’s first Test, so too that of Pankaj Singh, who has not been able to maintain such a high profile as his fellow debutant. Alastair Cook’s side arrived at Southampton stung by defeat in the previous Test and clinically blew India away. Somehow it feels that it will not be so straightforward for England this time. Runs were easier to come by in that series.Ed Smith, almost for the first time in his brief career as chief selector, has resisted any surprising, eye-catching call-ups. He might have ditched one of his openers, Keaton Jennings being more vulnerable than Cook even though he has mustered 14 more runs in this series (and 94 in total) than his senior partner. In fact, Cook’s run-drought may have assisted Jennings’s survival.Jonny Bairstow has been England’s highest run-scorer in the series, which helps to explain his inclusion even though he has a minor fracture of the middle finger on his left hand. That injury was obviously unfortunate but it may enhance the chances of a change that has already been considered by the England setup.They can see the virtue of Buttler taking the gloves on a more permanent basis, not necessarily because he is a better keeper but to allow Bairstow to bat higher up the order. Bairstow has always wanted to continue as keeper, perhaps as an insurance policy, which the England hierarchy insists he does not need.The long-term challenge for the England setup may be to persuade Bairstow of the virtue of becoming a specialist batsman up the order. In fact, this is a good time to do it. This winter the tours are in Sri Lanka and the West Indies the former has always been a venue to favour spinners, the latter has become something similar in recent years.In Sri Lanka especially the best place to bat is at the top of the order when the ball is hard and the pace bowlers are more likely to be in action. It becomes trickier to take charge at the crease in the middle of the innings when the spinners are happily in harness. The idea of inviting Bairstow to emulate his white-ball role as an opening batsman in Test cricket has some merit and for him the most attractive place to try this would be Sri Lanka.James Vince is in the squad at his home ground as cover for Bairstow and he is accustomed to batting at No 3. If he plays, then Joe Root may revert to No 4, which would result in Ollie Pope dropping down the order – or out of the side. In fact, the latter course is more likely, since the argument to play Moeen is strong. He has hit a rich vein of form with bat and ball. It would seem daft not to tap into that just to maintain the notion of consistent selection.Moeen would probably have to replace Pope or Adil Rashid, which highlights that the toughest selectorial decisions for this Test will be made, not by Smith, but by Root and Trevor Bayliss, who have the final say on who plays in the XI before the match begins.India do not have so many selectorial puzzles. Even so, Virat Kohli, the outstanding batsman in the series by a massive margin – he has scored twice as many runs as anyone else and faced twice as many deliveries – may yet keep his record by changing his Test team for the 46th time in a row. It is possible that Bhuvneshwar Kumar, now fit again, may replace Mohammed Shami, while there remain doubts about the fitness of Ravichandran Ashwin.For once the place of Hardik Pandya will not be open for discussion. He has enhanced his status as an all-rounder in this series, while demonstrating how it is possible for excellence in T20 cricket to be transferred to the five-day game if the ambition is there. Indeed, in a topsy-turvy week perhaps the most heartening news for those who cherish Test cricket came when Buttler said after scoring his maiden Test century at Trent Bridge: “This is definitely my proudest moment in an England shirt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54db937dcd59f001fed6c5072671267b580fb380/172_392_4753_2853/master/4753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c669254d538f74232a4786757f5977f2","title":"belgian grand prix f1 live","story":"Sebastian Vettel was in commanding form at Spa as he breathed life into the drivers’ championship by sealing his third career victory in Belgium• Read Giles Richards’s race report from SpaRead Giles Richards’s race report from Spa:The German and then the Italian national anthem blasts out of the speakers in Spa Sebastian Vettel is a very happy chappy. Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, looks pretty glum but he still has a 17-point lead at the top of the drivers’ championship, with Monza next up, and the chicanes of Singapore still to come. Vettel sprays champagne across the podium, but Hamilton’s not so interested in those fun and games. That was an emphatic victory for Ferrari who have really upped the ante to Hamilton, who simply didn’t have the legs to match Vettel down the straights. So, plenty of food for thought for Mercedes.That’s Vettel’s 52nd career victory, his fifth this season, his third victory in Spa and Ferrari’s first in Belgium since 2009, when Kimi Räikkönen was victorious. As for Mercedes, Bottas did brilliantly to fight back to fourth, but Hamilton was no match for a lightning Vettel in the end. Of the first lap overtake, Vettel says: “I’m not sure Lewis saw me, he pushed me quite far to the left but I knew I would get my chance later on. As soon as I was ahead, I was quite relieved. I had a very good restart.”Vettel closes the gap to Hamilton to 17 points! Ever since he stole in front of Hamilton on the first lap, it was never really in doubt, as he zoomed off into the sunset down the Kemmel straight. Ferrari were simply quicker, slicker and once Vettel nipped in front of the Mercedes, that was it. The only disappointing thing for Ferrari is that, with Räikkönen battered in that turn-one melee, he was unable to contribute and get into the points. In third, Max Verstappen, who was born 60-odd miles away, takes third, and secures his first podium finish in Belgium.Lap 4344: Vettel is almost 10secs in front of Hamilton. The Ferrari has cruised round Spa, and barring disaster, this result will re-alight the drivers’ championship.Lap 4244: 20km to go. “You’re doing a really good job, dude,” Grosjean is told down the team radio. Lovely.Lap 4044: Vettel seems to have this in the bag, he’s almost 8secs in front of Hamilton, who just hasn’t been able to get near the Ferrari after they both pitted. And now a straightforward move means Bottas is on target for fourth, after slipping in front of Pérez. Lap 3844: Looking at the points, Hamilton’s lead would be cut to 17 points, should Vettel take victory here and Hamilton finish second. That could change yet, though.Lap 3744: The Haas pair of Grosjean and Magnussen are down in seventh and eighth respectively. Just about in the points, Marcus Ericsson, the Sauber. A reminder that Ricciardo, Räikkönen, Hülkenberg, Alonso and Leclerc are all out. Meanwhile, Pérez’s pace means he continues to fend off Bottas, who will do well to better him now.Lap 3644: This is plain-sailing for Vettel. A safety car would spice things up, or a dash of rain. Lap 3544: Pérez reassures Force India that he’s “giving everything” with Bottas closing on him, but is there enough time for the Mercedes to trump the Finn. As it stands, the Force Indias would overhaul Williams in the constructors standings. So far, so good for them so far. Lap 3444: Hamilton’s lagging behind the Ferrari, approaching six seconds behind the nimble Vettel. The German seems to have this race sewn up, with Hamilton failing to get near him on pace on this dry track. Verstappen, in third, is miles in front of Pérez and almost 25secs behind Hamilton, so no wonder he fancies some rain. Lap 3344: A new lap record by Bottas, a 1.46.286.Lap 3244: “We wanted to wait until lap 30 to see about safety cars and stuff like that,” Christian Horner says of Ricciardo’s retirement, adding Red Bull were keen to keep their powder dry for future races. And up in fifth, Bottas nips in front of Ocon. As for Verstappen, he’s dreaming of rain, though his engineer is quick to inform that no such weather is expected in Spa any time soon. Lap 3144: Things are looking good for the Force Indias, with Pérez and Ocon fourth and fifth respectively. And Red Bull are going to retire Daniel Ricciardo, a disappointing day for the Australian, who will be off to Renault next season. Gasly, who will fill that void, has enjoyed another decent day at the office so far. The Frenchman’s in ninth.Lap 3044: Vettel leads Hamilton by 5secs ... the Ferrari’s having a wild time out on track. The Mercedes are struggling to match his speed, though Bottas is whizzing round, but it’s time for him to change those tired tyres. He goes on to the mid-range soft tyre and jumps out of the pits into sixth. Bottas will have to race his way back past Ocon and Perez in the remaining 15 laps or so. He started way back in 17th, carving up the field, but he will have to do it all again if he’s to finish on the podium.Lap 2944: Brendon Hartley’s up into 10th! The Toro Rosso makes light work of Ericsson through Eau Rouge and that’s a job well done. At the front, Bottas, who made a very early pit-stop, is still in fourth, though Mercedes will be mulling over their next move. Lap 2744: More movement in the pit-lane, with Ericsson and Magnussen both in for the Sauber and Haas respectively. Ricciardo remains the back marker. Lap 2644: Vettel stretches his legs, and he has established a little more breathing space. Hamilton trails him by 3.1sec, with Ferrari still very much in the box-seat. Bottas is a mighty 30sec behind Verstappen, who will pit imminently. He’s well on his way to potentially his first ever podium finish in Belgium. A 2.5sec stop sees the Red Bull come out comfortably in third place.Lap 2544: “Use everything for the tyre,” is the instruction for Pérez over the team radio. That usually means only one thing: he’s heading for the pits. Bottas is having great fun out there, up into fourth temporarily. Lap 2444: Bottas, meanwhile, is up into seventh place. Can he nab a podium finish? Vettel has flown through the middle sector, but it’s Hamilton who sets a new fastest lap of 1.46.721. Those new tyres are ripping their way round the circuit. And now Romain Grosjean, from down in eighth, pits. A clean stop sees him out inside 3secs. In third, Verstappen is yet to pit but will surely be in shortly.Lap 2344: .. Vettel comes out ahead of Hamilton, but only just. The Mercedes uses the slipstream to bypass Verstappen to take back second and now the gap to Vettel is just over 1.5sec. That’s almost the perfect outcome for Hamilton, who has Vettel firmly in his sights. Lap 2244: Vettel is whizzing round, trying to up the ante before heading into the pits. Ferrari are ready to receive. But can they get him out in front of Verstappen and Hamilton? They’ll also whack on the soft tyre.Lap 2144: Hamilton pits from second, ditching the supersoft for the mid-range soft tyre. He’s in and out in no time. And now Ferrari will react by pitting Vettel ...Lap 2044: “Tyres are good,” Hamilton says, adamant he’s still got grip. Hamilton sounds upbeat, despite a few worries over blistering. Vettel leads him by 3.1sec.Lap 1944: a nugget of news on Raikkonen Ferrari retired the car because it had a broken rear diffuser and rear-end plate, which they couldn’t fix in time. As Bottas continues to eat up the rest of the field, he closes on Magnussen, while Hamilton is edging closer to the race leader Vettel.Lap 1844: Bottas leans on DRS to sweep his way past a hapless Gasly. The Mercedes is gobbling up drivers for fun. Bottas is into eighth, with Magnussen 3sec in front of him.Lap 1744: Another fastest lap by Hamilton ... while Ricciardo’s on the team radio lamenting the pace of his Red Bull. He’ll need a miracle to finish this race anything but last. Up in the points, Bottas wings his way past Ericsson to snatch ninth. The message to the defeated Sauber is strikingly ambitious, too. “Let’s use Bottas to get past Gasly,” they tell him. Let’s see about that.Lap 1644: Encouraging news for Hamilton, with the Mercedes setting a new fastest lap of 1.48.479. He’s shaved Vettel’s lead to 3.7sec, but there’s still plenty of work to do. Has Hamilton been saving that one up?Lap 1544: Valtteri Bottas is up into 10th, with Marcus Ericsson’s Sauber next in his sights. After starting down in 17th, he’s already bypassed Sirotkin, Stroll and co. The Finn is up into the points and he’ll fancy his chances of flying through the field, and edging closer towards his Mercedes team-mate, Lewis Hamilton, who’s in second.Lap 1444: The Force Indias are parked in fourth and fifth, with Grosjean behind them in sixth. At the front, Hamilton is struggling to gain any ground on Vettel, while Verstappen is almost 12 seconds behind the Mercedes.Lap 1344: Christian Horner, the Red Bull chief, talks, with Max Verstappen buzzing, though Ricciardo, at the very back of the field, is having a torrid time. Horner says: “Daniel was unlucky to get harpooned by Fernando, that damaged the rear wing pretty bad but the boys have done brilliantly to get that turned round pretty quickly.” As for whether Verstappen can upset the front two, he adds: “I don’t think we’ve got the pace in clean air compared to Vettel and Hamilton, but I think our main race is really against Bottas.” Lap 1244: Vettel sets a new fastest lap of 1.48.495. The Ferrari has doubled his lead over Hamilton to almost 4sec, that pace is really troubling Mercedes. As Hamilton alluded to, Ferrari are lightning through the straights.Lap 1144: We’ve lost four cars in 11 laps. Plenty of drivers have gained as a result, though, with Bottas soaring up into 11th after starting at the back of the field. He’s got past Lance Stroll and his next target is Sirotkin. Lap 944: Räikkönen is back in the pits – again! Ah, and his race is over. He accumulated a stack of damage into that first corner, a rear-wing issue and a puncture, and he’ll join Leclerc and co down on the sidelines. Lap 844: Räikkönen’s been in the pits, his tyres steaming but his engineers look static, the scene is as though he’s serving a penalty, although there has been no official confirmation of such a thing. With the Ferrari struggling and Ricciardo way back, and a lap behind, it’s a marvellous chance for lesser teams to grab some points.Lap 744: Vettel has a 2.2sec lead over Hamilton, with the Ferrari absolutely flying. The Mercedes badly needed to steal back top spot, but appeared to lock up a little into the corner after the safety car restart. And now Verstappen has just trumped Ocon through the first sector, much to the delight of a pocket of Dutch fans that have made the trip over the border to Spa. Grosjean’s in sixth.Lap 644: Vettel sets a new fastest lap of 1.48.656 and he’s hurtling round the track, with Hamilton on his tail. Meanwhile, Charles Leclerc looks fed up as he trudges back towards the pits. His race was over within seconds.Lap 544: Verstappen’s fifth, Gasly is up to eighth, Sirotkin into ninth. The back marker is Ricciardo, and he’s a full lap behind the rest of the runners and riders. Lap 444: Vettel zooms away, but Hamilton reads his move all the way, but fails in his efforts to nip back past him. The Kemmel straight allows the Ferrari to open up a bit of a gap and he’s staying in front, for now at least. Ocon has dropped to fourth, almost a second behind Pérez.Lap 344: A truly chaotic start in Spa. To recap, it’s a premature ending for Leclerc, Alonso and Hülkenberg, who are all out of the race after a crazy run in turn one. Alonso flew through the air, crashing down on to Leclerc, who is absolutely furious. Hülkenberg was responsible for that domino effect, his brakes seemingly redundant. As for Ricciardo, will he be back for Red Bull, or his afternoon over as well? Now, the safety car will accelerate away ..Lap 244: Plenty to investigate after a frantic start to the race into turn one. Red Bull are trying to attach a rear wing to Daniel Ricciardo’s car, telling the Australian to sit tight but he’ll come out a couple of laps behind, even if they can magic a solution. His wing came flying off in that first-turn melee. Leclerc, meanwhile, is also out as a result of that clash between Alonso and Hülkenberg. There’s a full safety car, with Räikkönen profiting and getting a new tyre on board. As for Vettel, he had a much better run down Eau Rouge and Hamilton was powerless to prevent the Ferrari flying past him. It will be role-reversal when the race restarts in a moment or two. Wow! Crikey ... Fernando Alonso crashes out after a crowded turn one, rammed from behind by Nico Hülkenberg, who completely locked up. Alonso flies up into the air, over the Sauber but both drivers look OK. Hamilton and Vettel go neck-and-neck but after an even start, Vettel nips in front to take the lead! And Räikkönen’s got a puncture.Spa is absolutely rammed with fans, plenty of the Vandoorne clan are in the house, as you’d expect. This has the makings of another classic. We’re just a lazy formation lap away from the off. The spectacular Ardenne forest will provide a fitting backdrop for the 73rd Belgian GP. No Formula 1 driver has won more races at Spa than Michael Schumacher’s six. After success last year, Lewis Hamilton is on the hunt for his fourth victory in Belgium, while Vettel has won twice, most recently in 2013.Kevin Magnussen speaks. “We have a bit of an opportunity with the Renaults starting at the back. We need to make use of that and get a good result for both cars. It’s a really great track to race at, you just have to stay focused.”Stoffel Vandoorne, born in Kortrijk on the edge of the French border, has been chatting away about racing on home soil. “It’s a special feeling to race in front of a home crowd,” he says. “I hope we can bring back a result.” As for Nico Hülkenberg, who starts down in 18th, he says: “I just want to have a bit of fun out there. We had to swallow the penalty, coming from the back, we will see what happens.” A quick nugget on Ocon’s future, with the Frenchman in limbo after Renault swooped for Daniel Ricciardo, the first of seemingly many chess moves. The 21-year-old Mercedes protege had looked set to replace on-loan Spaniard Carlos Sainz at Renault until Ricciardo suddenly decided to leave Red Bull. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes chief who will dictate his future to a degree, says: “There are a few teams in for Esteban, and he will be in F1 next year, that’s for sure. He will not be kicked out.”*Bottas and Hülkenberg moved to the back of the grid for taking additional power unit elements, while Sainz and Vandoorne have since changed their engines"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42cfb6cf5f5a5bfb89d3f0e5763576f27abbf29a/0_94_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=650028218ffd62f1d2299590f28b3d2c","title":"new zealand woman wins top comedy show at edinburgh fringe","story":"New Zealander Rose Matafeo has won the coveted best comedy show award at the Edinburgh festival fringe. Steve Coogan, one of Matafeo’s comic heroes, presented her with the £10,000 prize at a ceremony in Edinburgh on Saturday.“I just wanted to do a fun, daft show,” Matafeo said. “I make comedy for women like me, in their 20s and looking for fun, and the response to the show has been amazing. I think a lot of women were going, yeah, that’s me.”The 26-year-old performer, of Samoan and Scottish-Croatian heritage, is only the fifth woman to take the title. Her fellow nominees were\u0026nbspthe award’s most erse yet, with comics from Australia, America, Russia, India, Ireland and Britain in\u0026nbspcontention.The winning show, Horndog, is about being a woman in her 20s looking for passionate relationships, rather than love. Matafeo talks about growing up as a geeky, film-obsessed teenager who had no luck with boys. When she did start dating she would become slightly obsessed, or as she says: “Go hard or go home.” Nica Burns, director of the awards, said Horndog is “an utterly original show, a totally hilarious spoof with a completely unexpected ending”.Described by the  critic Brian Logan as “a blissfully funny and charismatic performer”, Matafeo had returned to the Scottish capital from her native Auckland after a successful show last year and was one of a strong contingent of straight-talking female performers from Australia and New Zealand performing this year. Alongside Matafeo on the shortlist of seven contenders picked from the festival line-up was Felicity Ward, an established act from New South Wales. Last year, Australian Hannah Gadsby shared the prize with John Robins, who attended Saturday’s ceremony.Matafeo also beat strong competion from two former nominees for the award. Kieran Hodgson, who put together an unusual political show about the roots of Brexit called ‘75, was on the shortlist for shows in 2015 and 2016, while Ahir Shah, in the running this year for his stand-up set about visiting his deported Indian grandmother in the wake of the Windrush scandal, was also nominated last year.The other three nominees were Alex Edelman, Glenn Moore and Larry Dean.The 2018 award was given in memory of Sean Hughes, who died last October at the age of 51. He won the prize in 1990, when it was known as the Perrier award as it was sponsored by the mineral water brand.Reminiscing after the ceremony, Coogan, who won the prize in 1992 with John Thomson for a character comedy show, recalled how comics like he and Hughes loved the fringe in the 1990s. “It was a very special time, and people like Sean, Eddie Izzard, Paul O’Grady, Jo Brand, Jack Dee have all gone on to do great things. It felt like a new chapter in comedy and the Edinburgh fringe was the focal point for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6b247bd3841a9446a70e98534da38bd233e910/0_97_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d336a2ae78c94633487ba66f1db596","title":"lindsay kemp a life in pictures","story":"The experimental British choreographer and mime, who collaborated with stars such as David Bowie and Kate Bush, has died in Italy at the age of 80"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d3bfb87d27600d495ddfc3cc1589d5966ab9d2f/0_149_2251_1351/master/2251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ab114b174e00b55b1df46edadfffaff","title":"michael cooper chicago 68 photographs","story":"Michael Cooper was most famous for shooting candid moments with the Rolling Stones and the cover of the Beatles’ 1967 album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Those who could not, or would not, volunteered their time in community service instead.The scheme was abolished in 2011, but the belief that young people should dedicate a year to national service persists in many conservative circles. Now, the CDU leadership, keen to reunite the party around traditional core values, is revisiting the concept.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer,the CDU general secretary, suggested earlier this month that all young men and women should complete a compulsory “service year”. The plan, if implemented, would also apply to all adult asylum seekers and refugees, she added. The programme would see some young people join the military or the fire service, or help with disaster relief. The CDU hopes others would choose to volunteer as care workers, thereby helping address chronic staff shortages in care homes and hospices.The proposal came after Kramp-Karrenbauer – among the favourites to succeed Merkel as the head of the party – conducted a “listening tour” of the CDU grassroots, gathering ideas for a new manifesto to be presented at the forthcoming party conference in December.“Many CDU members mentioned reintroducing the draft or general compulsory service,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told the Funke Mediengruppe news group on Saturday, adding that she still remained undecided. She also explained the suggestions she had heard often mentioned including migrants, something she thought “worth considering”.“If refugees complete such a year, which could be voluntary or mandatory, it would help to integrate them into the country and society,” Kramp-Karrenbauer said. “It would also increase the acceptance of refugees among the population.”Her comments were immediately dismissed as “populist” by the Social Democrats and the proposal has so far found no support from the Greens, the leftwing Die Linke, or the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP). Only the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) supports reintroducing military service.A look at the main priorities set out in in the German coalition agreement, which will guide policy-making for the next four years.Efforts to reform the EU will top the incoming government\u0027s agenda as the bloc grapples with rising nationalism, security concerns and an unpredictable US ally in Donald Trump.As well as agreeing to bolster EU foreign and defence policy, the parties say they are ready to raise Germany\u0027s contributions to the EU\u0027s budget once Britain leaves. They also support the creation of a European Monetary Fund, but offer only cautious backing for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s idea of a eurozone investment budget.Smarting from the backlash over Merkel\u0027s decision to open the country\u0027s doors to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in 2015, the government now aims to cap the annual intake of people seeking safe haven to about 200,000.At the EU level,\u0026nbspMerkel\u0026nbspsays she continues to expect member states to take in their allocated share of refugees. The chancellor has also reiterated the need to tackle the root causes of migration with development aid for the countries of origin, while better securing the bloc\u0027s outer borders.Europe\u0027s powerhouse economy is booming, with workers enjoying high wages and record-low unemployment, but that has done little to assuage concerns about globalisation and automation in the workplace, as well as growing inequality.With its flush public coffers,\u0026nbspMerkel\u0027s government aims to address these fears through investments in infrastructure, an offensive to improve the nation\u0027s creaking internet networks, pension reform and more funding for education and life-long learning.Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, the German defence minister, has categorically rejected the idea that military service would return in its previous form – mostly because the army is not equipped to deal with the number of fresh recruits.The German military, the Bundeswehr, currently gets enough volunteer foot soldiers but is lacking specialised soldiers willing to invest in a long-term career with the armed forces.Still, the idea of a compulsory “service year” has a long way to go. It is possible it would require a change to Germany’s constitution, which forbids all forms of forced labour.But for the CDU, the renewed debate has had the desired effect of rallying the party around a common cause. If the idea is adopted as policy, the party hopes it will have a similar effect on the electorate.A compulsory service year would “strengthen social cohesion in Germany,” CDU’s minister-president of Saarland, Tobias Hans, told newspaper Bild am Sonntag. German youth get free school education and enjoy high social standards, he added. The nation “should be able to expect young people to give something back to their country” in return.

If it lives in the sea and is edible, there is every chance it can be found among the hundreds of stalls at the world’s biggest fish market and the sprawling nerve centre of a multimillion-dollar commercial operation.The shouts of shopkeepers beckoning customers mingle with tourist chatter in a host of languages. Soon, though, much of the market will fall silent. In October the core of its business – the hundreds of wholesalers that provide seafood, meat, fruit and veg to restaurants and shops across Japan – will move two kilometres east to new waterfront premises in Tokyo’s Toyosu district. The many shops and restaurants crammed into the maze of narrow streets on the market’s periphery will remain, but its commercial heart – the wholesalers – will be transplanted to a new building that holds none of the charm of the current market, which has stood on the same site since 1935.About 1,800 tonnes of seafood, worth billions of yen, pass through the Tokyo central wholesale market – its official name – every day. In addition to almost 500 varieties of fish, it sells 270 types of fruit and vegetables imported from around the world. Its 42,000 workers keep the market running around the clock.The loss of the shitamachi (downtown) atmosphere that has turned Tsukiji into a major tourist attraction is not the only problem occupying the minds of market workers. They were supposed to have said farewell to their overcrowded, aging premises and moved to Toyosu in November 2016. But Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, abruptly halted the relocation after evidence emerged that the new site – built at a cost of 588bn yen (£4.1bn) – was contaminated with dangerous toxins.Surveys revealed levels of arsenic and cyanide above government-set standards. Benzene up to 100 times the limit was detected in groundwater, while mercury levels between five and seven times the national air quality standard were found in the new building’s basement. Red-faced authorities struggled to explain why contractors had failed to fill hollow concrete chambers beneath the building’s floor with clean soil to prevent chemical leaks.“No one has any idea how this is going to work out,” said Yoshinobu Uka, whose business specialises in tuna sushi from the Kochi region on Japan’s Pacific coast. “There will probably be a dip in customers to begin with, and road access to the new site is going to be a problem. Lots of people who work as wholesalers will leave, so that will affect the atmosphere.”Polls taken among the market’s 500 or so wholesalers found most were against the move. But earlier this month Koike confirmed the new market would open on 11 October after experts declared the area, formerly the site of a gas plant, safe following a cleanup operation.Tatemasa Hirata of the Open University of Tokyo, who headed the panel of experts, said: “Safety has been secured in the market’s ground area with consideration for future risks. It won’t affect human health or perishable foods.”Michiharu Chino is one of many Tsukiji employees who oppose the relocation, fearing that cautious clients will refuse to buy the new market’s produce while doubts persist over its safety.“I’m really worried about safety standards at the new place,” said Chino, who acts as an intermediary between wholesalers and clients. “I don’t believe Koike’s claim that Toyosu is safe, and I know that lots of my customers are nervous about it too. No one, especially people with young children, will want to eat fish that has been handled there. But now the decision has been made I have no choice but to go there for my seafood.”There is no shortage of evidence that the current site is poorly equipped to cope with demand. Its thousands of occupants and their growing array of produce outgrew their surroundings long ago, and its rickety buildings are vulnerable to earthquakes.The market’s structural flaws were exposed earlier this month when its aging air-conditioning system malfunctioned during a heatwave. The demolition of the market is expected to trigger a major exodus of rats to other parts of the neighbourhood.Preparations for the move will disappoint tourists, who from mid-September will no longer be able to observe auctions of enormous frozen tuna, snapped up before dawn each morning and sliced up with bandsaws and frighteningly sharp knives before being shipped to restaurants and supermarkets. A spokeswoman for the market said public viewings of the auction would be revived at the new site, with tourists able to watch tuna being sold along a specially built aisle.But shopkeeper Hitoshi Sannohe believes that what is left of Tsukiji will continue to attract visitors after the wholesalers have moved on, citing Koike’s plans to turn the area into a “food theme park”.“Tourists come here to eat and take in the traditional atmosphere, and I don’t think that’s going to change,” said Sannohe, whose store has been selling dried seafood at Tsukiji for 40 years. “But we’re going into uncharted territory, as the market has been in the same place for such a long time. I and other shop owners are uneasy about the future, but all we can do is wait and see.”Robbie Swinnerton, a food writer for the Japan Times, is confident that standards will be maintained at the new site, with seafood stored more hygienically and sent on to customers faster than is possible now.But, he adds, the relocation will also mean the loss of a cherished part of Tokyo’s history and culture.“I really see this as the end of an era,” he said. “Tsukiji is the last bastion of traditional shitamachi culture, which has already been eroded by tourism and redevelopment. When it goes, Tokyo will lose a large part of its soul.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c02c76ffcfd15a8bfb208c0843f40c3e3b04c84/0_285_4521_2713/master/4521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d5bff21e2fdc8dbdcba7c33c25484b0","title":"venezuelan mass exodus continues amid economic turmoil","story":"Many Venezuelans fleeing abroad are adamant peaceful solution is no longer possibleDay after day the crowds flock to the Expresos Flamingo bus terminal in Caracas to begin checking out of their crumbling nation. Some carry their earthly possessions in suitcases or backpacks, others plastic bags containing water and snacks for the long journey ahead. All share a dogged determination to escape. “Food became so expensive that for months we weren’t able to eat three meals a day,” says Harry Flores, 41, who has been queuing for nine days with his family in the hope of boarding a bus to Peru.When he does secure those seats, Flores, an unemployed computer engineer who sold his car to bankroll the trip, will join a historic exodus from what was once one of South America’s wealthiest and most stable societies. Hundreds more made it into Peru through its northwestern border on Saturday despite new rules preventing Venezuelan migrants from entering without passports, which many lack because of the upheaval in their country. “We must act humanely with this vulnerable population,” said Abel Chiroque, the local ombudsman. Last week the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, vowed to reverse the country’s slide into hyperinflation and deprivation with what he called a visionary plan for recovery, growth and economic prosperity. “This is my economic recovery programme. It’s mine! And when I say it’s mine, I mean: it’s the people’s,’” Maduro tweeted on Wednesday, a day after his country was rocked by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake that some interpreted as a political metaphor for his teetering regime. Few experts believe Maduro’s measures will produce the economic miracle he promises. “There is zero chance it will work,” said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in the US and the co-author of a book on Venezuela’s political and economic decay called Dragon in the Tropics.In Venezuela, the plan has added bewilderment to the growing sense of despair.“When I went to the market today some prices had almost doubled,” complained Edelia Zambrano, a 31-year-old risk analyst from Caracas. Sandra Campos, a 32-year-old accountant, suspected she had been overcharged for her breakfast because of the befuddling new system. “The clerk charged me 50 times the price, because she confused the numbers. There’s too much confusion.” Just this year two plots to bring Maduro down have reportedly been foiled – one in May when a conspiracy involving top military officials codenamed Operation Constitution was thwarted, and another in early August when two explosive-laden drones failed to reach their target during a rally in Caracas. Many of the Venezuelans fleeing abroad are adamant a peaceful solution is no longer possible. “We’ve got to get him out: to eliminate him,” said Carlos Briceño, a 37-year-old from Maracaibo, as he queued to cross from the Colombian border town of Ipiales into Ecuador last week. Harold Antanas Trinkunas, a Venezuela specialist at Stanford University, said such scheming would inevitably persist, meaning Venezuelan and Cuban spies would need to be on constant guard against “outlandish” if amateurish attempts to kill Maduro.If, as seemed likely, Maduro’s economic plan failed to stop the rot an Arab spring-type uprising was also possible which could lead to “a very unpredictable outcome as we saw in the Middle East and North Africa”. Trinkunas added Maduro might also be purged by his inner circle and replaced with “a more competent strongman” such as longtime rival Diosdado Cabello. Corrales also saw the most likely challenge coming from within but said Venezuela’s leadership had proved surprisingly resilient. Maduro is the president of Venezuela. He served as the interim president upon the death of Hugo Chávez in March 2013, and won a hastily arranged general election in April 2013, narrowly defeating opposition candidate Henrique Capriles.Maduro was previously a bus driver and trade union leader. He was elected to the national assembly in 2000 and was appointed to a number of government positions by Chávez, including foreign ministerThe president, who lacks the charisma of his predecessor, has seen his approval ratings plunge amid widespread food shortages and triple-digit inflation. He stands accused of authoritarianism over his crackdowns on protests and attempts to shut off opposition paths to power. He claims he is the target of a US-backed economic war aimed at removing socialist control over the world\u0027s biggest oil resourcesIn the meantime, the daily pilgrimage to the Expresos Flamingo terminal continues, even if buses sometimes fail to arrive because the economic crisis prevents drivers from keeping their vehicles on the road. “The bus company told us to come back tomorrow,” said Johanna Diaz, 25, an unemployed waitress who was trying to reach Ecuador and insisted she would not abandon her place in the queue or quest for a fresh start. “I won’t leave,” Diaz said. “There’s no way I’m losing my spot.”"},{"url":null,"title":"smart","story":"Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside traditional CAO system"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Pontiff tells single mothers separated from children that to seek them is \u0026lsquonot a mortal sin\u0026rsquoScience and religion make strange bedfellows, one big clash being the central issue of faith\u0026lsquoNone of us can fail to be moved by the stories of young people who suffered abuse\u0026rsquoDelight among crowd of over 40,000 as pope tours Knock shrine and acknowledged \u0026lsquoopen wound\u0026rsquo of abuseVatican officials have declined to immediately comment on letter published last nightStand For Truth rally at Garden of Remembrance began at same time as the papal MassPope chief celebrant as Phoenix Park mass attracts smaller than expected crowdMarie Collins asked pope why Church is still allowing disgraced church leaders resign instead of being firedLarge number of roads are closed until 11pm including routes alongside Phoenix Park25-year-old mother was thrown from back window of car in Bundoran in crash that left two deadDavid Walsh (27) was the second person in a decade to drown in such circumstances at Newport Pier\u0026lsquoThe last time a pope visited Ireland, homosexuality was a crime.

Photograph: Getty ImagesEarly mediaeval bishops used to sign their communications with the formula “peccator episcopus” – sinner and bishop. Pope Francis came to Ireland in a somewhat similar mood. His quietly rueful demeanour could hardly present a starker contrast to the radiant charisma and supreme self-confidence of his predecessor John Paul II in 1979. But “peccator episcopus” is a hard trick to pull off when you happen to be bishop of Rome. However much Francis may wish to have come among us as a humble sinner, he cannot escape the reality that he heads an institution that is struggling to fully confess its sins, let alone do penance for them.Francis is not a pompous man, but pomp and ceremony come with the job. If it’s your job to be driven down O’Connell Street in a transparent vehicle bestowing blessings on all and sundry, it is not easy to be what Francis surely is: a decent man struggling to articulate the “shame, pain and outrage” he says he feels for his church’s systematic covering-up of child abuse. The crowds may be modest and the atmosphere low key. But the papacy can’t quite shake off its heritage as the successor to the Roman empire and even Francis can’t entirely avoid seeming like an emperor on tour to a far-flung province.Thus, on the one hand, he can seem genuinely at ease among so-called ordinary people in the Capuchin day centre and Sean McDermott Street. And he was probably just as much at ease with President Michael D Higgins, whose passions for social justice and environmental sustainability he shares. If his visit were not so bafflingly short and he had taken the time to do what he does best – spend time with people who are marginalised and suffering – he might really have made a difference. He might have revivified the sense of Christianity as a radical option for the poor as opposed to a form of institutional power. But this visit feels too much like a ceremonial procession with a pastoral purpose added in as an afterthought for that to be possible.And on the other hand, for all his obvious sympathy with suffering, Francis still failed to rise to the obvious need to embody a church that is genuinely shocked at its own deep moral failings. It was a truly woeful idea for Francis to seek to provide reassurance by suggesting as the gold standard of contrition the open letter his predecessor Pope Benedict sent to Irish Catholics in 2010: “His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the Church’s leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again.”It is hard to understand how Francis imagined that stressing the continuity of the church’s response to child abuse was a good idea when a radical break with the past is so obviously necessary. If Benedict’s response to the crisis was “frank and decisive”, how come the hidden truths are continuing to emerge? How come no independent observers, or indeed most of the Irish bishops, believe that Benedict’s actions were even vaguely adequate, let alone decisive?Usually, when someone comes to visit, you get to know them better. But Francis seems even more enigmatic for his presence among us. How can someone have such a warm human touch on the one hand and be so terribly out of touch on the other? How can he be so deeply sympathetic to human suffering and so apparently unable to do the things that would stop it? It is as hard not to warm to him as it is to figure out how his humble humanity sits with his aura of ine power.Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

It was just protocol, they were told.“Victor was ashamed to be handcuffed in front of his children, but it was far worse for both of us to see our 14-year-old son handcuffed, literally for nothing,” Olga Andropov told Dutch radio from the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, later that day.That might have been the end of the story, but for the fact that – quite uncharacteristically – the reserved people of Culemborg took to the streets and staged a noisy protest at the family’s deportation and to highlight the bizarre situation in which they now found themselves in Ukraine.With nowhere to go, they were given shelter by a religious institution in Kiev. They approached a local school and discussed the fact that their three children spoke neither Ukrainian nor Russian – which, they were told, could be a problem for the two boys.In particular, they were warned, it would pose real psychological and emotional challenges for Maksim, who has a developmental disorder – a fact confirmed by the principal of his Dutch school, Joost van Rijn.It was here that a story which was already sad and bizarre became downright Kafkaesque.Viktor and Olga were advised that they could apply for three-month tourist visas for Maksim and Denis – who, after all, were born in the Netherlands –– so that they could return to their old school in Culemborg next month to resume their studies in the new autumn term.The advice was good, and the tourist visas to the country where they were born were duly granted earlier this month.They will stay with the families of former school friends during the week, but have no idea what will happen when the initial three-month period has passed.“In three months’ time they’ll come back to Ukraine and we’ll apply for two new tourist visas,” says their mother. “I have no other ideas: that’s the best I can do for them at the moment.”So, having allowed Victor and Olga to stay in the Netherlands for 17 years, and to raise a family here, the authorities have now deported them to a country where their children cannot be schooled because they don’t speak the language – with the result that they will have to return to the Netherlands on tourist visas to continue their education.There is, no doubt, an immigration official somewhere in the Netherlands who would attempt to justify that sequence of events, but for the people of Culemborg justification is impossible.“This has made a big impression on the children in particular,” says the family’s lawyer, Frank King. “They were living quietly in a Dutch community. They were going to school, speaking the language, integrating well. There was no need for any of this.“Now they’ve been traumatised by being taken from their home and sent to a completely alien location where they know nobody. They’ve been treated like criminals. What they’ve learned is: you cannot trust the Dutch system you thought you were part of.”King says he’s considering taking a case in the Dutch courts on the grounds that the immigration authorities’ actions were contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Archbishop Viganò\u0027s allegations suggest similar measures had already been implemented earlier but reversed.  The Vatican had no immediate comment on the document. This afternoon the Pope will lead a huge outdoor Mass in Dublin\u0027s Phoenix Park, for which half a million people have tickets.The Pope\u0026#039s visit to Ireland, in picturesThe religious engagements come after the first day of the Pope\u0027s historic visit to Ireland was dominated by the bitter legacy of historical scandals linked to church abuse and mistreatment.On Saturday, the Pope met a number of victims of criminality and cruelty inflicted by church members.The private engagement in Dublin came hours after Francis expressed pain and shame over failures to tackle the scandals.Some of the survivors who attended the behind-closed-doors meeting said the pontiff employed blunter language with them, apparently using the Spanish word caca - Spanish for shit - to describe those who covered up abuse.Abuse survivor Marie Collins, who was at the meeting, told the Press Association: He was very frank, he listened to us all and he gave us all an opportunity to talk about our experiences.She was also among thousands attending an event in Dublin\u0027s Garden of Remembrance organised by clerical abuse survivor Colm O’Gorman.The #StandforTruth rally aimed to make victims and survivors of clerical abuse visible during the Pope\u0027s visit.Attendees listened to speakers and music before processing to Sean McDermott Street, the site of one of the last Magdalene Laundries.A protest also took place at Tuam, Co Galway, where a large crowd marched to the grave site, led by a group of survivors, and the names of 796 babies thought to have been buried there were read out.  The events coincided with the Phoenix Park Mass, for which organisers said half a million people had tickets.Thousands cheered and waved to the Popemobile as it passed through the park but it did not appear that all the space was filled, with entire areas empty of spectators. Some estimates put attendance as low as 150,000.Please review our commenting policySyrian refugees fear they are being lured back to arrest and conflict despite regime charm offensiveBreakfast cereal boxes criticised for depicting portions that are too bigOne in three bobbies on the beat have been axed since 2015 despite a surge in violent crimeShock and awe: we\u0026#39ve been on front line for years, say women, as Royal Marines open up commando course to allGPs receiving millions in funds for 3.6m ‘ghost patients’Italy\u0026#39s interior minister faces kidnap charges after immigrants held for ten days at sea Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns to prison in Iran after furlough extension deniedLive: The Pope holds mass for 500,000 in IrelandFamily court judge who inspired new BBC film The Children Act speaks of heartbreak over harrowing caseZimbabwe inaugurates Emmerson Mnangagwa as president From Vanity Fair to Killing Eve: the best autumn TVUK weather: Britain set for two inches of rain - but sun will return for Bank HolidayFrom Line of Duty to Bodyguard: the Jed Mercurio formula for heart-pounding drama perfectionUS senator John McCain dies aged 81 after battle with brain cancerComment: We\u0026#39re signing away our personality, as well as our privacy Spain accused of pushing migrants north through EuropeTheresa May orders space race after Brexit with sat-nav system to rival EU\u0026#39s Galileo GPs receiving payments for 3.6 million \u0026#39ghost patients\u0026#39Surgeons to use \u0026#39hologram\u0026#39 goggles to see inside children\u0026#39s hearts We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000132278850_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"shock awe front line years say women royal marines open commando","story":"Royal Marines before the assault on the final objective during the Nato exercise Sabre Strike 2017 in the Suwalki Gap, Lithuania.

The normal military rules of separating the male and female accommodation will be waived in the name of troop cohesion. Women have previously been allowed to attempt the nine-week commando course designed for military personnel who will be attached to 3 Commando Brigade, but this is the first time women have been offered the chance to serve as regular Royal Marines.Only two women have passed the nine-week \u0027All Arms Commando course\u0027: Major Philippa Tattersall of the army\u0027s Adjutant General\u0027s Corps, and a naval officer. All combat roles in the military are to be opened up to women by the end of 2018.Women have served as helicopter pilots for many years and as such have been involved in every aspect of air assault operations.

The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/25/11/nicki-minaj-0.jpg","title":"nicki minaj margaret thatcher queen radio shout out queen","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Everyone has to express their truth and I have to ruffle a few feathers along the way, I don’t care\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureNicki\u0026nbspMinaj\u0026nbsphas caused a whirlwind of confusion on social media after giving a shout-out to Margaret Thatcher, the late former Prime Minister.\u0026nbsp“Everyone has to express their truth and I have to ruffle a few feathers along the way, I don’t care,” Minaj\u0026nbspsaid on her Queen Radio show.

funding after no-deal BrexitBritain stands to lose around half a billion pounds of annual European science funding in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jeopardising research into cancer and other health treatments, new figures reveal.The UK receives €1.28bn (£1.15bn) every year from Horizon 2020, the EU’s funding programme for science and innovation.The nation would lose around 45 per cent of the cash, and its ability to influence key European projects, in a no-deal scenario, according to analysis by the Scientists for EU group.The government had previously attempted to reassure scientists by claiming they would still have access to EU funding under ‘third country’ rules, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But following the publication this week of their plans for a no-deal Brexit, the government has updated advice to scientists to concede funding from the EU would be lost.\u0026nbsp“Third country participation does not extend to some Horizon 2020 calls”, the advice now reads.That line\u0026nbspupdated a report published at the beginning of August which said: “In a no-deal scenario, UK researchers and businesses would be able to apply to, and participate in all those Horizon 2020 calls open to third country participants from the date of exit.”Without full membership of Horizon 2020, the UK would lose access to money from the European Research Council (ERC), Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and SME Instrument grants, which are not available to “third countries”.The revelation comes after leading scientists voiced concerns about a chaotic exit from the EU and declared their support for The Independent’s Final Say campaign, calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor

participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchThe highly prestigious ERC and MSCA make up the biggest chunk of funding from the EU, and losing them would be a major hit to the UK’s scientific community.Professor Lisa Bortolotti, of the University of Birmingham, and whose mental health research s psychology, psychiatry and philosophy, said\u0026nbspthat without the\u0026nbspprogrammes, “projects like mine could not be pursued in the UK”.“Losing ERC funding is mad,” she added.Olivier Stephan, who coordinates grants at the Francis Crick Institute, said the ERC drives some of the country’s most important science, citing its work fighting cancer.While, he said, the institute was\u0026nbspworking on the basis ongoing grants are safe, there are fears for the future of British scientists and the country’s ability to attract foreign talent.On top of a hit to UK science, the SME Instrument programme provides £143 million to small, innovative UK businesses, funding around 17 per cent of their research and development.The government has said it will step in to replace any lost funding if necessary, but the effects of third country status go deeper than monetary value, according to some experts. \u0026nbsp“Throughout my career I have had many, many grants, but none as transformational as the ERC grants,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at Durham University. “Access to these grants to a very large extent determines where the very best researchers in the world want to go.”“In short, it’s a mess,” said Dr Mike Galsworthy, programme director at Scientists for EU.Besides the “chilling effect” the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is having on grant applications and hiring in the sector, he noted people who received EU grants were having to register with the government “just in case”.“So it’s devastation if it does happen, and just lesser damage, red tape and waste if it doesn’t,” he said.According to Scientists for EU, third country status would also mean UK researchers in European projects could no longer take leading roles, as the EU will not be willing to put them in charge of the money.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspis why Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, says it is essential the government arrives at some kind of deal.“If that doesn’t happen, there is a danger of us being a sort of lame duck, just looking at what the opportunities are and trying to become partners in research consortia without driving anything,” she said.The Tories’ plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any more‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitDespite assurances, Dame Anne said she felt “we are really no further forward” with understanding the status of science after Brexit.“In March next year if there is no deal, the EU is not going to scrabble around to help researchers in the UK,” she said.“There may be an accommodation reached for a period of time, but there will be a hiatus, and research does not work well with a hiatus.”Professor Frenk added, unlike some of the predicted effects of a no-deal Brexit, the loss of scientific funds would not change the country overnight.“The effects won’t be seen tomorrow, they won’t be seen next year – they will be seen gradually over the years as we see a general decline in the scientific excellence of the UK,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as

hour at the holy site in County Mayo on Sunday morning on the second day of his historic trip to the Republic of Ireland.Around 45,000 people were expected to attend the ticketed event.The significance of the site goes back to the evening of 21 August 1879, when Knock was a small, rural village.At around 8.30pm, 15 people saw a light coming from the parish church so they made their way over to the gable wall to see what it was, said Maria Casey, marketing and communications manager at Knock Shrine.Pope feels \u0027pain and shame\u0027 at failure of church to tackle sex

descend on the area as newspaper reports spread across Ireland, England and America, and the shrine became known for miraculous cures.Soon after the vision it was claimed that Delia Gordon, a 12 year-old deaf girl who suffered severe pain, recovered her hearing after a piece of cement from the gable wall was placed on her ear.\u0026nbspPeople started to come here in the hope of receiving cures, and Knock became synonymous for that, said Ms Casey.And people came to the spot of the apparition to get some clay or holy water to send to abroad.It has developed over the years and it has a very unique story in the sense that it\u0027s the only shrine in the world where the Lamb of God has appeared.As well as being a Marian shrine, it is a Eucharistic shrine. People have a special affinity with the place.An estimated 1.5m pilgrims travel to the Knock Shrine each year.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis passes by a banner of a protester as

economic hit from no-deal EU exit, setting up clash with HammondDominic Raab has dismissed his own government’s forecast of huge economic damage from crashing out of the EU without a deal, insisting most such predictions “prove to be wrong”.The Brexit secretary set up a clash with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, by rejecting his warning of a 7.7 per cent hit to GDP and an £80bn black hole in the public finances.The projection is the Treasury’s own analysis of the impact of a no-deal Brexit over the next 15 years – because of the loss of market access to the EU and chaos at Britain’s borders.But, asked about the stark warning, Mr Raab said: “I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.”Speaking to The Sunday Times, he added: “We need to treat some of the forecasts with a measure of caution”, before claiming that estimates of economic growth next year “have been revised up”.In fact, the Bank of England has cut its GDP forecast for 2019 to 1.7 per cent – well below the pre-referendum growth rate – and warned “the economic outlook for the UK remains clouded by Brexit uncertainties”.In the interview, Mr Raab also brushed off polling evidence of growing public unease about the prospects for Brexit, as the negotiations remain deadlocked.“The majority of people think Britain will be better off\u0026nbsplong term\u0026nbspfor leaving the EU. People think, just get on and deliver it. That\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do,” he insisted.Last week, Mr Hammond triggered renewed Tory infighting – and Brexiteer calls for him to be sacked – when he confirmed the Treasury’s fears about a no-deal exit.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchIn a letter to the Treasury committee, he said the analysis showed “GDP would be 7.7 per cent lower (range 5.0 per cent to 10.3 per cent) relative to a status quo baseline”.And he added: “GDP impacts of this magnitude, were they to arise, would have large fiscal consequences.”Nicky Morgan, the committee’s Tory chairwoman, leapt on the conclusions, saying: The chancellor has confirmed that the government forecasts a disastrous hit to our economy and living standards in the event of a no-deal Brexit.”But the intervention came just hours after Mr Raab attempted to reassure the public over a disorderly exit, even citing “opportunities” that could arise.\u0027University research projects at risk of collapse amid no-deal Brexit\u0027No-deal Brexit \u0027will be blocked by at least 40 Tory MPs\u0027Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealThe Tories\u0027 plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any moreIn the interview, Mr Raab hinted at warm relations with Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator.

It’s a huge question.”Pressed on whether he believed the prime minister could get a deal through the chamber, he added: “I think it’s very unlikely she’ll get a deal through the House of Commons.”Lord Heseltine said that for months he has been saying there “had to be a second test of public opinion” either through a general election or a second EU referendum.“I think probably a referendum,” he said when asked which he would prefer. “It’s one or the other. Events will dictate which it is.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union While the prime minister has categorically ruled out a second referendum “under any circumstances”, Labour has left the option on the table should parliament reject Ms May’s agreement with the EU or if a no-deal Brexit is looming.On Friday, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies,\u0026nbspsaid Labour would rule nothing out – echoing comments made by his frontbench colleague Sir Keir Starmer\u0026nbspthe previous day.Referring to Mr Johnson’s column in the Daily , in which the former foreign secretary said those wearing niqabs resembled “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”, Lord Heseltine\u0026nbspadded: “I think he should apologise.“My concern is the ripple effect. If people like him start using language that stimulates the worst elements of racism, it licences people to go further with impunity. ‘If Boris can say it, I can say it’. It becomes the sort of slogan of the racist element of the right wing.”He suggested there could only be two explanations for the contentious column that attracted widespread criticism. “One is that it’s a mistake and if it’s a mistake he could say so. The other is that he calculates it would advance his street cred with the right wing of the Tory party. And I think it’s possible he’s right with that judgement.”Asked whether he believed it was likely Mr Johnson would challenge the prime minister for leadership of the Conservative Party, Lord Heseltine added: “I think it’s much more likely that events will dictate the pace of change.“I would not expect him to make a decisive move – the move may be made inevitable by vacuums or by other people signing letters of no confidence, all these sorts of things, or by losses of votes in the House of Commons.“There has never been in my view such an unpredictable, calamitous set of events facing us.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with

followThe IndependentTechnology transforms how sniffer dogs hunt down poached ivory and rhino horn in African wildlife trafficking hotspotA pioneering technique that enables dogs to detect illegal ivory and rhino horn more easily and quickly than ever is being trialled at Africa’s biggest wildlife trafficking hub.Authorities expect the new system to allow them to detect more illicit animal parts, plants and timber products that are hidden in crates and help identify the criminals behind the cargos.The shocking truth about illegal ivory in Europe Ivory ban could be extended to protect hippos, walruses and narwhalsLife sentence for ivory possession urges Kenyan minister Leading ivory trade investigator stabbed to death in KenyaThe new approach –\u0026nbspat Kenya’s Mombasa port, a hotspot for illegal wildlife products being exported from Africa –\u0026nbspinvolves taking a small sample of air from shipping containers.The samples are passed through special filters that are then presented to dogs who have been trained to sit when they smell wildlife contraband. \u0026nbspThe technique has been introduced jointly by conservation giant WWF, UK-based wildlife charity TRAFFIC and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), who believe it could transform the battle against the illegal wildlife trade that threatens species with extinction.\u0026nbspWorld leaders need to commit to ways of stamping out the illegal wildlife trade once and for allAround 90 per cent of Africa’s elephants have been wiped out in a century mainly because of the demand for ivory in Asia. Rhino species are critically endangered or vulnerable after decades of being targeted by poaching gangs, and around 300 pangolins are poached every day\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspon average one every five minutes.​WWF’s East Africa wildlife crime coordinator Drew McVey said: “This technique could be a game-changer, reducing the number of endangered animal parts finding their way into overseas markets like Southeast Asia.“Man’s best friend is a trafficker’s worst nightmare: dogs’ incredible sense of smell means they can sniff out even the tiniest amount in a 40ft container.“As organised criminal syndicates use ever more sophisticated methods to hide and transport illegal wildlife products, it is vital that we continue to evolve our efforts to disrupt the barbaric trade.”Mombasa is a favourite port with smugglers of illegal wildlife parts, drugs and weapons. A 2014 wildlife crime report found it was Africa’s most active ivory trafficking hub. Between 2009 and 2014 18,817kg of ivory was\u0026nbspseized there.Before the trial, dogs were used in searches at the port and in transit by being led from container to container.The African heat and high number of containers – at least 2,000 a day –\u0026nbspmade conditions for the animals incredibly hard, officials say. Containers had to be opened in the presence of staff from Kenya Revenue Authority, customs and Kenya police, along with either the owner or a representative.\u0026nbspThe new technology, known as Rasco (Remote Air Sampling for Canine Olfaction), makes searches faster for both officers and dogs and eliminates red tape. The sniffing process can be done in climate-controlled rooms, allowing many more containers to be checked.Wildlife Photographer of the Year People’s Choice award18 Winner – Pikin and AppolinairePikin, a lowland gorilla, had been captured and was going to be sold for bushmeat but was rescued by Ape Action Africa.

A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith.

While shared widely on social media over the past day, it appears to have been recorded in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum.The Irish border, which zig-zags for more than 300 miles across the north-east of Ireland and is crossed by 200 public roads, has been the biggest issue facing Britain as it leaves the EU.During the Troubles, the period of civil unrest in Ireland during the late-20th century, major border crossings were blocked by British Army checkpoints, with some smaller routes closed completely.Fears of a return to a hard border and a return to bloodshed have grown since England and Wales voted to leave the EU in June 2016.

And that makes you wonder what status this part of the Chequers statement has?Asked if the Chancellor should consider his position, he said: \u0026ldquoI want the Prime Minister to consider whether what she said about collective responsibility applies to the Chancellor or whether he has a special exemption.\u0026ldquoThe decision would be whether or not the Government has collective responsibility or whether it is once more suspended.\u0026ldquoIf it is suspended then that will leave people within the Cabinet free to oppose Chequers.\u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg has urged Prime Minister May to be more like Margaret Thatcher  (Image: REUTERS)\u0026ldquoIf it is part of the overall statement, she probably ought to put back the people who resigned because they would be free to oppose it, too.

There is hardly even a pretence they are fair-minded, high-minded examinations of what the economic outlook is, he said.\u0026ldquoThis is what was effectively happening under Gordon Brown and reinstituted by George Osborne in the run-up to the Brexit vote and has been kept in place by Mr Hammond.He called for a change in mindset towards Brexit in government. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod like to see government view Brexit not as a damage limitation exercise but as opening up a world of opportunity.\u0026nbspGrassroots set to back alternative to ChequersAN ALTERNATIVE to the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit proposal will have wide support among the Tory grassroots, says Jacob Rees-Mogg.Last week the Sunday Express revealed that 100 MPs could back the plan.Mr Rees-Mogg said this was \u0026ldquonot an unrealistic number. The plan is due to be published within weeks as the European Research Group of MPs fights Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers proposals.The document will set out how the UK could leave with a Canadian-style free trade deal.\u0026nbspSources say it will also make clear that leaving on \u0026ldquono deal\u0026rsquo terms, under which the UK would use World Trade Organisation rules, is nothing to be afraid of. Asked if the alternative plan would attract widespread support, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoThere is a lot of support for an alternative to Chequers. When I speak to Conservative members at local association events I find there is little support for Chequers.

Heres the latest.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a British-Iranian mum, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation – the charitable arm of the news agency – and a former BBC employee.She was arrested in Tehran on April 3, 2016, and accused of plotting to topple the regime.Nazanin was stopped from returning home to Britain after visiting family with her daughter Gabriella, now four, and thrown into prison, where she spent months in solitary confinement.Her family says Iran’s Revolutionary Guard tried to get her to confess on camera that she trained and recruited spies - a charge she denied.Nazanin was convicted of plotting the soft toppling of the Iranian government and sentenced to five years behind bars.She was set to become eligible for early release in late 2017 or early 2018 but was hauled back to court and confronted with two new charges that could see 16 years added to her sentence.She was accused of joining and receiving money from organisations working to overthrow the Islamic Republic.Iran says Nazanin’s former employer, the BBC, is trying to topple the Islamic theocracy.She is also accused of protesting outside the Iranian embassy in London.On 23 August 2018, the 38-year-old was given a three-day release from prison to visit her daughter - who is staying with an Iranian family.Fears had been growing for her mental wellbeing, as reports claimed Nazanin was suicidal as she awaited a round of sentencing.The mum is just one of several dual nationals held in Iran on espionage charges, likely to be used as bargaining chips in future negotiations with the West.A UN panel of experts recently described the practice as part of an emerging pattern since the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.On May 21 2018, she was dealt a fresh blow when a Iranian judge told her to expect another conviction after appearing in court over a new invented charge.In November 2017, then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson vowed to phone his Iranian counterpart over fears that he made comments which could lead to Nazanins sentence being doubled.The Foreign Secretary said the British-Iranian was teaching journalism during her visit to the country before she was arrested — but her family insists she was on holiday visiting relatives.Her defence has been that she was merely visiting relatives on holiday with her then 18-month-old daughter.Iran’s judiciary claimed Boris Johnson’s “confession” had “voided” the UK government’s case.Boris was quick to apologise for his remarks.He said: “It was my mistake, I should have been clearer and I apologise for the distress and anguish caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family.“I have apologised not just for the mistake but the way it was taken and any extra suffering and anguish my words have caused.”He told MPs the UK government had no doubt she was on holiday when she was arrested.He said he did not believe his comments had had any impact on the judicial process in Iran.On December 9 the then Foreign Secretary travelled to the Islamic Republic of Iran and held talks with his Iranian counterpart to call for the release of the mother-of-one.Following frank talks between the Iranians and Mr Johnson Ms Nazanin Zagharis court case was postponed and she was not summoned to a trial as had been expected.Boris said the trip to Iran was successful and he hoped that Nazanin could be released.Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratcliffe, an accountant who lives in North London, was not with her when she was arrested, and has been campaigning for her release ever since.He called on the Government to do more to secure his wife’s freedom and set up a petition last year demanding action.Richard blasted the latest charges by Iran, dismissing them as “games” that make the country “look foolish” and bring its legal system into disrepute.He said Boris had done a good thing in clarifying his comments, and asked him to try to visit his wife in Iran.He also begged Boris to take him to Iran so he could see his family - the regime in Teheran has refused to issue the campaigning accountant with a visa.The couples daughter Gabriella is being cared for in Tehran by her grandparents after the tots passport was initially confiscated.A ray of hope emerged before Christmas 2017 after Nazanin was told she was eligible for early release.Nazanins lawyer told the 39-year-old that her case was marked on the Iranian judiciary database as eligible for early release.However, nothing came of the matter and she was stuck in the prison.In August 2018 she was given a three-day release from jail to visit her daughter.Emotional pictured released by the family showed smiling Nazanin hugging her daughter Gabriella as they were reunited.She spent time with her family in Damavand, a town north east of Tehran.The Free Nazanin campaign claimed Evin prison guards told her she had just ten minutes to get ready before leaving.It added that she dressed and packed quickly as her cellmates gathered round.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was hauled back into prison day on August 26th.The 39-year-old had spent three days with four-year-old Gabriella and was hoping to get an extension to her temporary release."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 -

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The vast majority come for a better life and a decent job and integrate perfectly.Our objection is to short-sighted politicians who failed to foresee the cost.Now wages are depressed, houses and rents unaffordable, schools overcrowded, the NHS and our transport system under massive strain.Migrant numbers should be tied to our economic need — but it is vital, with the annual net increase still at 280,000, that we build the infrastructure to match.What’s being done? Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers. But the scams grow more and more credible and sophisticated. It’s easier than ever to be taken in and plenty are.The Financial Ombudsman argues that it’s unfair to assume victims are “grossly negligent”, and we agree.The onus must be on banks to beef up their security processes and software to keep our funds safe — as well as to keep hammering home to all customers the risk in handing over information.Last year only a quarter of the £240million stolen got refunded.That represents a shameful shirking of responsibility.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her cash had not arrived. The Venezuela economy is in freefall and hyperinflation has brought the country to its knees.Speaking out to The Sun on Sunday, the 68-year-old tore into the failing socialist policies Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants to imitate.She said: “I have lived here all of my life and we have never had it so bad. This is a disaster.“I don’t have anything. I should get my pension and my disability payment for my spinal condition.“I just want to get a coffee or something to take away the hunger. I can’t remember when the last time was I had a proper meal.”Asked why she does not spend the folded 100 bolivar banknotes that form a sad tiara around her forehead, the former maid replies: “This money is worthless now because of inflation.“Five years ago 100 bolivars would have been enough to fill my fridge. Today the shops won’t take them as they are worth so little.“If Jeremy Corbyn thinks this is how to run a country he should come to see this place for himself.”The socialist nation of Venezuela is on the verge of collapse with inflation at 82,700 per cent and as thousands of malnourished citizens continued to flee across the border.Experts warn that inflation is set to hit one million per cent by the end of the year.A single chicken cost 15million bolivars in the old currency and the local version of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire has been cancelled as the top prize of two million bolivar — 13p — was not enough to buy a loaf bread.The economy has shrunk by 50 per cent since dictator Nicolas Maduro took power in 2013 and crime is rocketing as people do whatever it takes to feed their families.Corbyn and his allies have repeatedly praised the socialist experiment that has transformed Venezuela from one of the wealthiest countries in South America to a bankrupt state with £39billion in debts.In 2014, the 69-year-old Labour leader, then just an MP, phoned human rights abuser Maduro to discuss the “fight against capitalism” during a television interview.He went on to express his admiration for his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, and ended the call by saying: “Congratulations to you, Mr President.”Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said at the World Economics Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year that the country’s problems were because it took a “wrong turn” and wasn’t socialist enough.Today, in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, it is hard to find people who share his enthusiasm for a regime that caused food shortages and forced the poorest to scavenge.Unemployed surveyor Antonio Cardenas, 64, saw his son Goram, 20, shot dead by muggers three years ago.Sadly his story is all too familiar in a place where wearing gold or openly using a mobile is “suicidal” on the lawless streets where 73 murders take place every day. Antonio said: “People are scared to criticise this government but the fact is this system does not work.“My son was killed because the criminals were desperate for his money. They shot him in his back.”President Maduro has blamed the crisis on his capitalist enemies and promised an “economic miracle” that will turn things around.This week Maduro, a former bus driver, created a new currency called the sovereign bolivar that has taken five zeros off the value of the old one, devaluing it by 96 per cent.But the new money has only added to the confusion as shops struggle to figure out how to value their goods.And with prices rising every minute, the old bills are still being traded alongside the new ones, sparking chaos in a country where power outages often cause the debit card network to freeze.Meanwhile, we found that the president’s promise of raising the minimum wage by 3,000 per cent had yet to be passed on to staff.Security guard Francisco Bonilla, 41, earns the equivalent of £7.81 a month as £1 is currently worth 12,878 of the new Bolivar currency and about 12million in the old.Queuing outside an ATM, he said: “I earn just over 100,000 in the new currency, it’s not enough to feed my wife and three children. We try to live off beans and cheese.“The government says it is raising my wages but my boss has told me he needs to wait and see what is going to happen. I’m very worried.”Violent protests shook the country last year and an audacious attempt to assassinate Maduro was made this month when drones fired rockets at him as he gave a speech.The president has responded by rounding up ­dissidents and clamping down on the foreign press.Our reporter and photographer filed this despite the constant risk of arrest for doing simple things like exposing empty supermarket shelves caused by food shortages.Meanwhile, ugly breeze block buildings, built by the socialists are covered in anti-government graffiti with “hungry” and “freedom” scrawled on the crumbling masonry.Just 20 years ago, when Chavez was elected president in 1998, oil-rich Venezuela was flush with money that allowed him to pump funds into public services.Today, while subsidised oil means that a tank of gas costs pennies and the roads are clogged with diesel spewing old cars, socialist policies have hampered businesses and stopped foreign investment.Many rely on the black market to survive.Women turn to prostitution in neighbouring countries, others smuggle petrol across the border to sell to foreigners. At night the capital becomes eerily dark because there are rolling power cuts.Pensioner Samuel Silva, 81, says he cannot find the medicine for the serious blood condition his wife Hilda Reyes, 78, needs to stay alive as the hospitals in this socialist utopia are so short of essentials.He said: “My parents moved here from Columbia when I was 12 years old because they wanted a better life. Today it is a mess.“If people in Britain elect Jeremy Corbyn to be Prime Minister, my message to them is that they had better get used to being hungry.“Socialism is a great system, unless you like to eat.”GOT a story?

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a variation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She did not seem nervous. If anything, it looked rather routine.She stopped for a few moments and then jumped in a very determined way – preventing her hitting the ship or getting sucked in by an engine.Miss Longstaff, from Cheltenham, went overboard sometime before midnight on Saturday night.Its not clear when the alarm was raised but at some point the cruise ship circled back around to look for her and the captain filed a missing person report at 2.17am on Sunday.She spent 10 hours floating at sea - later crediting her yoga training with keeping her fit enough to survive.The Croatian coastguard joined the search and at 9.40am miraculously plucked her from the sea about a mile from where she jumped.The delay meant the ship was late docking in Venice and holidaymakers missed flights back to Britain - with passengers hitting out at Miss Longstaff.After her rescue, she had told Croatian media: I fell off the back of the Norwegian Star and I was in the water for about 10 hours. These wonderful guys rescued me.Two police investigations were launched - one in Venice, where the liner eventually docked, and one across the Adriatic in the Croatian city of Pula.Prosecutor Roberto Terzo, who oversaw the Italian inquiry, said that when officers presented him with their findings, he quickly decided to close his file.A spokesman for his office told the Mail that it happened in Croatian territorial waters, but added that no crime was committed, saying: She jumped voluntarily.Officers in Pula also came to the same conclusion, the paper reports.Miss Longstaff has remained holed up in her apartment at Benalmadena on Spain’s Costa del Sol with her boyfriend Craig since the dramatic rescue operation.In the days afterwards, fellow passengers admitted seeing her drinking and said she had been having rows with her partner all day.Her dad Ron Longstaff, 76, a retired cop from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, also said she had recently been going through a “hard time”.But what prompted her drastic action remains a mystery.The Sun Online has approached Miss Longstaff but she declined to comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428917423.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"english charities less lotto money","story":"Charities and organisations in Scotland received the equivalent of £10.87 per person last year — compared with just £6.34 south of the border.Angry MPs last night hit out at the details as services in Scotland are already heavily subsidised by taxpayers in England.It comes as it emerged this week that Scots receive £1,576 per head more in state spending than the UK average of £11,954.Lottery grants worth £353million were awarded in England compared with £59million in Scotland but Scots receive more cash per person.It also emerged that the Big Lottery Fund, which distributes the cash, gives £10.36 to Northern Ireland and £8.95 in Wales per person.The figures were uncovered in the Big Lottery Fund annual report.Last night Tory MP Kevin Foster said: “This is a national, UK lottery and each country should receive their fair share.”A spokesman for the Big Lottery Fund said: “Our priority is to ensure people across the UK can access National Lottery funding and it makes the biggest possible difference to communities.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a real concern about safety.”One of the region’s MPs is Luciana Berger, the Parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, has repeatedly been targeted for abuse.The former shadow minister for public health said she felt “unwelcome” in her own party after Mr Corbyn’s recent “inexcusable comments”.In response to the official complaint a party source told the Observer they were not aware of it, but a Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party’s complaints procedure operates confidentially in the interests of fairness to all concerned.“This is to ensure protection of the personal data both for any members who make complaints, and for those to whom complaints relate.“This enables procedures to be followed properly.

You know, like, what is your heritage?He decided to do a DNA test and eventually found a first cousin who said they knew who his mother was.He said: He wrote an email to me and said, You know, I think I know who your mother is. We’ve heard throughout our lives that there was a baby we were related to who was left in a telephone booth, just kind of like a hidden secret.’Steve then discovered he had a half-sister, who said his birth mother was still alive and living in Baltimore.She had been just 18 when she gave birth to Steve but his father told his mother he would only marry her if she got rid of the baby.The woman did as he asked, leaving her tot in the telephone booth but then the man eventually disappeared.She eventually moved on and went on to marry another man and they had two daughters together.Steve is now planning to go and visit his birth mother for the first time later this month.He said: Whatever she feels comfortable saying to me, I’ll take.

miles away from home in a huge operation.But Riff Raff marched back within 48 hours, destroying more fences in his path.Now Humane Society International has launched a £7,000 project to relocate him.Audrey Delsink, the charity’s executive director, said: “If he stays, he’ll almost certainly be killed.”Ms Delsink said of the planned move: “He’ll be the oldest, most dominant bull in a much larger reserve – with many new, unrelated females.He’ll be the females’ first choice, so will definitely be siring offspring for many years to come.The society are expected to use giant crates and a crane to move the elephant to his new home.A tracking helicopter will also be used in the operation, to ensure Riff Raff doesnt flee once more.Bull elephants usually live for around 70 years, meaning

the North Sea.Passenger Teena Dowd said the captain announced there was a life raft on the ships starboard side at around 6.30pm, and that within the hour the three men had been helped onto the boat.Ms Dowd, who is on the vessel with her daughter, said concerned passengers lined the deck and clapped as the shaken men were helped out of their lifeboat.The Canadian, who lives near Toronto, said: We were on the very top deck, and people were just sort of holding their breath, everybody was anxious.Because we all at the time thought there was only three of them, and everybody clapped when they came on the ship.But we didnt know until a while later, when the captain announced that there was actually two more and we were still searching for them.Ms Dowd said the crew threw a rope out to the trio in the hexagonal life raft, before extending a ladder so they could climb up the side of the ship.One of the men fell into the water as he attempted to climb the ladder and had to be pulled back into the raft before more sturdy stairs were put in place, she said.She said: Originally they didnt think we were going to be able to rescue them, the captain announced we were just going to float next to them so they were blocked from the wind until the coastguard got here, but then they were able to get close enough that they were able to climb up our ship.The ship stayed in the area for more than two hours before being released by the Coastguard and continuing to Dover, passengers said.The Coastguard said a search and rescue helicopter from Humberside, RNLI lifeboats from Gorleston, an independent lifeboat from Caister and other vessels were helping with the search effort.Lee Duncan, coastguard operations controller for the east coast, said: The crew of the sunken

It looks like one figure until broken open and all the egos and rivalries come tumbling out. Inside this Cabinet doll are two moppets who think they could do a better job than the PM: Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid. And while they vie to be top banana they are united against a common enemy, Chancellor Philip Hammond. This trio are members of the 10-strong inner Cabinet chaired by the PM and charged with organising a smooth withdrawal from the EU. Its official tongue-twisting title is the European Union Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-Committee – better known in Whitehall as the Brexit War Cabinet. Thing is, what Mrs May is really dealing with is a Cabinet at war. On Thursday, one of its two newest members, Dominic Raab (the other is Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt ) unveiled the first 24 of 84 no-deal Brexit papers. They were intended to reinforce his message that no deal is no big deal and whether the UK gets a deal or not we’ll barely notice leaving Europe.  But it was a tightrope act. On the one hand, the assessments of what no deal would look like had to be as bland as possible to avoid inflaming Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group, a cabal of 62 Brexiteer Tory MPs. On the other, no deal had to be sufficiently unpalatable to urge MPs to support Mrs May’s Chequers proposals, hammered out seven weeks ago, for a negotiated EU settlement. Wobble Raab is no more than a mouthpiece for the PM’s chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins. He held the tightrope. A Tory source said: “Dom is impotent. His department is really run by Olly.” But the Brexit Secretary could not even wobble to the end of the wire before the Chancellor knocked him off with what pro-EU campaigners called a “Brexit bazooka”. Spreadsheet Phil announced to Remainer Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan that no deal would cost \u0026pound80billion in extra borrowing. Theresa May hit the roof. A Whitehall source told the Sunday Mirror: “No10 ordered him not to do this. And they’re extremely annoyed he did. Dom worked his socks off, and then it’s deliberately overshadowed.” Spreadsheet is not entirely alone in Cabinet. He’s backed by Treasury Secretary Liz Truss and Energy minister Claire Perry. But colleagues consider Ms Truss a bit odd, and few listen to Ms Perry. If Michael Gove pitches himself against the Chancellor, he’ll be backed by three fellow Brexiteers – International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, \u0026shyTransport Secretary Chris Grayling and Commons leader Andrea Leadsom.

Council leaders launched a bid for a slice of the funding pumped into the National Citizen Service, which the former Prime Minister has boasted was “one of my proudest achievements”.

Medics are notorious for scrawling illegible notes – increasing costs and putting patients at risk. Mr Hancock will get rid of the need for them entirely by changing rules to help GP surgeries and pharmacies who do not already use electronic prescriptions to switch to them. Currently an electronic prescription can only be given if a patient has a nominated pharmacy. That restriction will be lifted this autumn. He said: “We need to harness technology across the NHS to improve care, save time for patients and make lives of hardworking staff easier.” More than 6,000 GPs – 63 per cent – are now able to upload prescriptions electronically so they can then be downloaded by a pharmacist.  The figure was just one per cent in 2010. But a Health Department source said: “There are still paper prescriptions being written. “That is throwing away taxpayers’ money. It’s Mr Hancock’s ambition to help more GPs and pharmacists embrace the digital revolution.” The NHS could save \u0026pound300million a year by 2021 if all prescriptions were electronic. Mr Hancock added: “It can’t be right that there are occasions when archaic paper prescriptions still have to be used. “Electronic prescribing saves GPs’ time and helps to give patients a better, more seamless experience.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gcse exams need reviewed because","story":"NewsopinionGCSE exams need to be reviewed because of student stressUnion leaders, teachers, children are all ­saying the same thing.

It’s a bit hazy but I got the basics – English, maths, science. Failed technology, passed history, which means I can’t change a plug but can tell you when it was invented. In the run-up we all had the usual anxieties and pressures. Queueing up outside one exam, a mate of mine told a teacher he was “scared”.  She said: “You’re not scared, you’re nervous. Scared is a different thing. There are plenty of things to be scared of – but not exams.” And she was right.

Four million people are thinking of switching to Labour, says a poll of 10,000 voters published exclusively in the Sunday Mirror today.

Snoozing in their bedroom lies Chitty, the first dog the pair ever adopted when they arrived in the country 10 years ago, and Polly, a feisty pup with just one eye.   Chitty and Polly soon join the couple’s other 96 dogs in the garden for breakfast. Some of the disabled ones need feeding individually to make sure they eat properly, and then there’s Joey, the Doberman, who is the couple’s biggest dog and requires one extra meal per day. After brekkie it’s nap time.  \u0027It’s so humid, the dogs spend most of the day snoozing in the shade, says Mary.   While this might not sound like everybody’s cup of tea, Mary couldn’t be happier.  Steve and I met in a pub when I was 26. I beat him in a game of pool and we clicked, explains Mary.  We built a life together. I worked in HR, Steve, now 59, was in manufacturing. We owned our own home in Bradford. We weren’t stinking rich, but 10 years ago we were comfortable enough to take a risk. We decided to go for early retirement and explore the world while we were still young enough to enjoy it.  A friend suggested they start their adventure in Kerala, India, home of palm tree-lined beaches overlooking the Arabian Sea. The pair rented out their home, sold most of their belongings on eBay and gave everything else to friends, family and charity shops. Then, in March 2008, they bought a two-week package holiday and jetted off.  While there we volunteered at an animal sanctuary and we fell in love with Chitty and Legsy, two puppies that had been found on the street. says Mary.  They’d wait for us to arrive each day and we couldn’t bring ourselves to leave them. The big move  So instead of leaving Kerala after the two weeks, Mary and Steve made the huge decision to stay put, checking out of their hotel and renting acommodation so they could take Chitty and Legsy home with them.  In those first few weeks we realised Kerala had a big problem with street dogs, explains Mary.   People here don’t treat dogs with the same affection we do. It’s not uncommon to throw stones at them. One of our dogs, Podge, came to us after her previous owner tied her back legs with wire, simply because she used to gnaw furniture. Shocked by what they saw, Mary and Steve started feeding the street dogs, and they hired a rickshaw with a driver to carry the food. The driver, Kukku, would slam on the brakes and dive into bushes, returning with a stricken dog he’d spotted.  We were kindred spirits, smiles Mary. In the dog house After four years, the dog lovers had adopted so many street dogs that they now shared their home with 40 rescues, and they decided to upsize.  Our new house is actually smaller, but the outdoor area is five times bigger, which means we could help more dogs, says Mary.  I never wanted kids, which baffled the locals. They thought there must be something wrong with me and asked if I’d been to hospital! It was soon after this that Mary and Steve set up a rescue centre called Street Dog Watch, and asked Kukku, their driver, to be clinic manager.  We realised we couldn’t keep taking in dogs without trying to get to the root of the problem, says Mary.  While it’s illegal to kill strays in Kerala, the fine is 50 rupees, which equates to 50p.  It’s not enforced anyway, says Mary. Before every tourist season, a barbaric culling programme would begin, with dead  dogs all over the streets. Locals put out poison too.   So Mary introduced the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme, spaying and neutering street dogs, and giving them an anti-rabies vaccination.  PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) calculates that by sterilising 2,000 dogs, the ABC programme could have prevented the birth of over 60 million street dogs over the years.  The figure is staggering. It’s better that 60 million dogs never lived, than lived a life of suffering, says Mary. Four years ago, the couple sold their UK home to help fund their projects.  We’ve spent over \u0026pound300,000 of our own money, but it still doesn’t cover all our costs. Lots of animal lovers, both locally and in the UK, sponsor dogs or donate money. It costs \u0026pound15 to sterilise a street dog and \u0026pound25 to feed our dogs each day. All of Mary’s dogs are either injured street dogs or puppies found abandoned. They all have names too. Joey doesn’t like going outside, Podge is lazy, and Iolo was thrown over the clinic wall in a plastic bag. While he’s one of the smallest dogs, he’s also the most confident. Saving lives  Street Dog Watch continues to rescue, feed, vaccinate and sterilise. Healthy dogs are returned to the street or adopted, although locals only adopt males, thought to be better guard dogs.  Mary says, We have 89 females. Our five males can’t guard for toffee! They hide behind our legs.   People abroad often want to adopt the dogs, but Mary doesn’t recommend this.  It’s traumatic for a dog to travel a great distance and can cost \u0026pound5,000, she explains.  I encourage Brits to sponsor or donate towards our vaccination and feeding programmes instead. Better to adopt a dog already in the UK – there are plenty in need.  Mary is also in talks with the local government to agree funding for the ABC and anti-rabies programme. She has met with local authorities to dissuade them from a plan to build a cage in the forest to throw street dogs in.  They hadn’t thought about how they’d feed them, or what they’d do when they started breeding. I convinced them it was a terrible idea, explains Mary.  Mary and Steve’s retirement pot is dwindling, but the couple are happy to live frugally.  Our crockery is cracked and I rely on hand-me-downs from friends. I wear dresses until I wear them out then shred and plait them into dog toys. Old clothes also make great bedding and bandages, says Mary.  We don’t go out much – you can’t when you have 98 dogs! I don’t like to spend on myself when I know how much further money can go for the dogs.

But when I started crawling, huge blisters popped up all over my body from the friction of the floor on my skin.  My parents, both nurses, took me to the doctor right away, and after many tests I was diagnosed with a rare genetic skin condition called Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), which affects only half a million people worldwide.  Put simply, my skin lacks the protein that binds the layers together, and it blisters and tears at the slightest touch. You can imagine how tough this was as a child – I wanted to run about and climb trees, but in order to do the ordinary things that kids do, I had to wear thick padding all over my arms and legs.  For the most part the other kids were pretty accepting when I was little – it was as a teenager that life became challenging. Girls often struggle with self-esteem at that age anyway, but I was sure that no one would ever find me attractive because of my skin. I picked clothes that covered me up and I’d hide in the loo to change for PE. I remember being in a class once, chatting away with my scarred and blistered hands on display. A boy came wandering over, took one look at me and said, ‘Urgh, look at her hands!’ I was mortified and rushed home in floods of tears. That day stuck with me for years. Managing my skin  My daily routine has always been focused around my skin, which requires a lot of care. Every morning, I remove my bandages and run a bath with sea salt and baby bottle steriliser in it. I soak for about 20 minutes, then I shower with a special soap, dry myself carefully, and set up everything I need for the next, time-consuming stage.  With a small needle, I drain the blood blisters on my legs, before applying an antiseptic gel to any open wounds. Next, I apply cream to the patches of healthy skin, before bandaging up my entire legs and sticking large plasters over my bum and lower back. Because my legs are so long, I need lots of rolls of bandages.   EB affects me internally too. I have a narrowing of my oesophagus so I’m prone to choking on food and I get blisters in my throat.  Every four years I have an operation to widen my oesophagus – I’ve had it done three times, under general aesthetic. People with my condition also have a considerable chance of developing skin cancer by 35, and this is something I’m coming to terms with.  My model life  Because I’ve always been tall – I’m 5ft 11 – and skinny, I was often scouted by modelling agencies, but as a young teen I brushed their offers aside: there was no way I was confident enough to display my skin. After all, if I was too embarrassed to even tell my friends about my condition, how could I show my flesh on a catwalk or for a camera?   But at 17, I was tired of secrets and started to tell my friends about my EB. It was such a relief when I opened up – they were so understanding and were interested, because for years they’d never wanted to ask about my skin but they knew I didn’t want to talk.   Telling my friends felt like a weight lifted from my shoulders, and gave me the confidence boost I needed to try my hand at modelling. My first shoot was terrifying, but now I enjoy it – I’ve done campaign shoots with prestigious photographers and big brands like Misguided. In the early days, I’d make a feature of my skin in shoots, but I’m trying to stay away from that now because I want the message to be that your skin doesn’t define you as a person.

Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond (try Ardlui), Loch Ness (consider Borlum), or one of the many along the coast (check out Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland).  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent (above) which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle (above) from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389 (save \u0026pound98) and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove (below), which is now \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250 (A4) Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home. It\u0027s well worth checking with the local council if you\u0027re not sure. Go on a great road trip!  A day trip or staycation break by road could be perfect for your family. Avoid queues by bagging a handy sat nav - which will also keep you on route and give you a pretty reliable answer to the \u0027are we there yet?\u0027 question. The Garmin Drive Sat Nav (below) - priced \u0026pound89.99 (save \u0026pound10) comes with lifetime map updates so you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.  Also be sure to check your car is in good shape before heading out as there\u0027s nothing worse than planning a great bank holiday trip only to be thwarted by vehicle trouble. There are some simple things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, how is your car battery doing? Telltale signs that something is wrong include trouble starting the engine and lights that are dim when the engine isn\u0027t running - simple enough to check when you\u0027re parked up. Also, be wary that the hot summer months have a big impact on your car battery.

Noah Robinson did not leave hospital for 305 days while he went through a string of ops –and had to be brought back to life four times. And his beaming smile as he marked his birthday on Friday was a sight mum Mollie feared she might never get to see. Mollie said: “Once, his heart stopped for a full 20 minutes. Every second was an eternity, watching my impossibly tiny son looking like a lifeless bird.  “But every time we thought his time was up, he defied expectations and his little chest would start rising and falling again.” Noah was born at Leeds General Hospital at 27 weeks after Mollie’s placenta stopped providing blood and nutrients. He weighed just 495g, or 15oz. In the weeks that followed, he needed surgery for a hole in his heart, had a tracheostomy so he could breathe, had two hernias fixed, an op to fix his acid reflux, and a feeding tube in his tummy.  Mollie, 23, of Wakefield, West Yorks, said: “He was so small and fragile. Every time a doctor or nurse approached me I panicked, thinking they’d have bad news.” Faced with a two-hour trip to see Noah, Mollie was rescued by the Sick Children’s Trust, which runs a home at the hospital for parents like her.

Kay Longstaff’s partner, Craig Rayment, 43, had his assets frozen by Spanish authorities as they sent him notice of a tax debt, it is reported.  Banks have reportedly been warned not to lend Mr Rayment, who runs a business for Brits in Costa del Sol, any more money because of his allegedly poor credit rating.  Mr Rayment, an electrician, was reportedly given a fortnight to settle his finances. It is unclear whether he has managed to yet or not, according to The Sun .  The news comes recently after it emerged Ms Longstaff, 46, who had claimed she had accidentally fallen off the deck of the Norwegian Star, had actually purposely lunged into the Adriatic Sea, according to investigators.  Ms Longstaff had told Croatian TV in the aftermath of the ordeal last Saturday night that she had fallen accidentally and her yoga had given her the skills to resist as she waited for rescue teams to fish her out. But according to Italian and Croatian authorities, the woman voluntarily went overboard as she did so in a determined fashion. However, what caused her to jump remains unknown. CCTV images show the air hostess was alone when she went overboard at 11.45pm on August 18. Mr Rayment was reportedly in bed when the incident unfolded and did not report her missing until 2am.

Birmingham Live reporter Stephanie Balloo decided to find out exactly what the family holiday camp is really like. During her trip, she found chewing-gum trodden into the carpet and saw dirty towels and empty crates of booze dumped in the entrance at the Brean Sands holiday park in Somerset. The choking stench of stale cigarettes filled an apartment and the toilet seat had been left broken with razor-sharp edges. It transpired a major mix up by staff meant she was given the spare key to a family\u0027s occupied flat, exposing all their belongings. One horrified dad she spoke to revealed images of what he believed to be \u0027human faeces\u0027 smeared on his paid-for bedding. Another told how their child had cut their feet on loose tiles in the swimming pool. Stephanie kept a detailed account of her short stay - here is her diary...  3.30pm: Popular destination with Midlands families The taxi driver tells me that Pontins Brean Sands is a popular camp with families from the Midlands. 3.55pm - Surrounded by caravan parks Driving through it seems there are plenty of other options for holidaymakers wanting to enjoy Brean Sands beach. The camp is surrounded by a number of caravan parks. I arrive at Pontins Brean Sands in a taxi and give my details to security who hand me a form to fill out. 4pm - Musty smell in chaotic arcade As I opened the door to what I imagined was a quiet reception desk, I was immediately plunged into chaos. Dozens of arcade machines all ringing simultaneously, children racing around and a musty lingering smell like an old-fashioned pub. One staff member mans the entire reception and I join the queue of around seven families - all waiting to check-in to their rooms as key collection starts from 4pm. The arcade carpet is stained with filth and blobs of chewing-gum are trodden into the disgusting flooring at reception.  4.25pm - Friendly staff The young receptionist is polite and friendly enough - calling me \u0027babes\u0027 and handing me a map with the route to my apartment. She also explains how I\u0027ll have to put at least \u0026pound5 of electricity into the meter on top of the \u0026pound139 I paid for two nights in a one-bed apartment. There is no Wifi apart from in the main building, I discover. I was directed to the fun factory to find out what entertainment the night had in store for me. Surprisingly, it seems quite an extensive list, despite previous complaints from families there is nothing for the kids. Though judging by the week\u0027s schedule, the entertainment is largely the same every night, with a Pontins character kicking off the evening, different Blue Coats performing and a disco to finish.  4.40pm - Cigarette butts and litter Walking through the holiday park to my allocated apartment I realise the reception isn\u0027t the only filthy area. Cigarette butts and rubbish is dumped all over the park - especially near the benches outside the main entrance. En route to my accommodation, I passed a neglected skate park, a strangely quiet adventure play area and a Nisa Local. The grassy areas around the play parks - dotted within the accommodation - were littered with discarded cigarettes as well.  4.45pm - \u0027Sick\u0027 on the steps I\u0027m first greeted to my apartment block with the sight of what appears to be someone\u0027s vomit. I try to dodge this as I haul my suitcase up the steps. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience.  4.46pm - Horrifying scenes at my apartment A full to the brim bin, burnt trodden-in popcorn and two damp towels - one strewn across the filthy corridor floor and another hung up on the rail. There was a empty crate of beer abandoned and a mug full of cigarettes and ash dumped on the floor outside too. And this was just the exterior of my allocated apartment. I was horrified but despite everything I\u0027ve heard about Pontins, I thought surely this can\u0027t be right. But from the window I thought someone had genuinely left my room in this state, so I double checked the door - number 60. And double checked my documents - number 60.  4.48pm - Spare key to somebody\u0027s apartment To my surprise the key worked, but as I tried to enter, a rubbish bag full of half-eaten food and cans erupted and spilled out - blocking the entrance. A blast of stale cigarette smoke hit me and I begged internally to escape this hell. Inside, soiled underwear appeared stuck to the floor, sausages in thick grease on the oven and a bowl of what I can only describe as green slime. I spotted a mobile phone and pairs of shoes and realised Pontins staff had made a very worrying mistake.  4.54pm - Displeased neighbour The guest next door tells me the people in number 60 have been staying there for days and have just popped out for the day. It begs the question, why was the apartment all set for me to check-in? Nevertheless, the neighbour doesn’t seem surprised and tells me lots of families have had problems. They’ve lost the plot running this place, she says, as she explains how her room had no running water and a broken TV. She adds that her fire alarm keeps going off too. 5pm - Room mix-up not \u0027uncommon\u0027 When complaining to reception about my apartment, the formerly chirpy lady now seems inconvenienced and replies agh okay before calling the manager. She explains that there is two sets of keys and suggests the family should have checked out. What may have happened was they were meant to have booked out but obviously the system hasn\u0027t updated that they\u0027ve booked an extra night or something like that. It doesn\u0027t happen too often. It\u0027s just that crossover - it has happened before though. She is unapologetic for the inconvenience caused, as is the manager - who says somebody had gone into a room they shouldn\u0027t have been in. He claims he was off to find out who they were and sort the situation. 5.10pm - New apartment damp and reeks of smoke I get my keys to the new apartment, no 61, and it is relatively clean save for the broken toilet seat with the sharp edges. The harsh smell of smoke makes me choke slightly as I enter and there\u0027s dripping damp all over the ceiling too. A bucket has been placed underneath to collect the condensation. Small yellow blobs stick to the inside of the bath, though I\u0027m unsure what these are.  5.31pm - Faulty smoke alarms sounding The smoke alarm has randomly started ringing and refuses to stop even though there is no smoke present. There\u0027s no way to turn it off and fifteen minutes later it is still sounding. I think it is time to get out of the room. But as I leave, I realise it is the whole block and guests are furious. They say it has been going off constantly all week in the entire block every time anyone tries to cook for their children. They claim Pontins staff have not done anything to resolve the situation. 5.45pm - Furious guest says \u0027never again\u0027 Reacting to the fire alarm issue, a guest staying in my block says it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever been here and the last time too. Another guest says there was no water to bath his children and he entered the apartment to find other people\u0027s food still in the fridge. 6pm - Hidden costs Dozens of families have flocked to the fun factory as the evening entertainment kick starts with a paparazzi session with Chuckles the monkey. The bluecoats are admittedly very enthusiastic and seem to excite the children. There are huge queues of families waiting to see the favourable monkey mascot, but these extras for the kids all cost more money. It costs \u0026pound5 for the children to have a photo with the monkey while outdated cheesy 80s music plays in the background. 6.30pm - Litter-plagued leisure area There is litter everywhere and young kids are running around without a parent nearby. Towards the rear there’s an \u0027inflatable zone\u0027 consisting of just two pieces of equipment, but the kids seem to be enjoying it. In the leisure zone there seems to be plenty to do, with go karting, paddle karts, a play area with swings, an \u0027urban gym\u0027, a skate park, trampolining and the pool. However, all of which is outdated and will cost more money in the form of tokens purchased from the leisure centre.  7pm - Pleasant beach nearby Brean Sands is just a three minute walk and is perhaps one of the few selling points for the camp. The long stretch of beach is soft and clean, perfect for young children staying in the nearby Pontins.  7.20pm - Buffet on dirty plates The evening meal at the Queen Victoria pub for those who opt for self-catering is \u0026pound8.95 and consists of some salad, grated cheese, \u0027vegetable pie\u0027, cod fish cake and chips. There\u0027s also some sliced potato with \u0027mince-meat\u0027 underneath. Some of the plates have spots of food from previous meals clinging on and the food smells are a bit overwhelming. There\u0027s food squashed into carpet and on the floor and the dessert fridges are a mess. I force a little bit of food down but it is largely tasteless just like the squash which misleadingly brands itself as 100% juice.  7.35pm - Dirty fridges Dirty fridges full of bashed up bits of cake is the offer for dessert. Crumbs of pudding spill out from the fridges and onto the floor - ready to get squashed like everything else on the food hall floor. Though admittedly what was left of the pudding was surprisingly tasty.  8pm - Bluecoat entertainers The fun factory is packed out with hundreds of parents, young babies, toddlers and even teenagers. The blue coat entertainers are up on stage and encouraging the kids and parents alike to be silly - including dancing around like various animals and being soaked with a water gun. Chuckles the monkey comes out on stage and pantomime style jokes are made, leaving the children in fits of giggles. Everyone seems to be having a great time - especially the children.  8.30pm - Staff selling toys During the performance, Pontins staff try to squeeze more money out of the guests by offering light up batons to the kids for a set price. There is also a shop at the front selling Pontins branded toys and another store at the side of the main hall. 9pm - Non-stop evening entertainment The entertainment is non-stop and as soon as \u0027party time with Chuckles\u0027 ends, the children are up on their feet once more dancing to classic school disco songs. The jam-packed line up is great to see and clearly has most people enjoying themselves. 9.15pm - Scantily-clad dancers as children watch With the children still present, the parents continue to drink and the adult entertainment begins. Female dancers in crop tops dance around the stage and sing loud rock songs in the \u0027I wanna rock\u0027 show. As the concert gets underway, the Blue Coats dance seductively as rows of children sit looking up at them.  9.35pm - Bouncers on patrol There are four bouncers currently manning the bar area and entrance for the fun factory. 9.45pm - Young children play while parents drink Children as young as around six play in the parks outside the apartment blocks with no parental supervision in the pitch black as adults continue to drink inside the main hall. 10.30pm - Chaos as fire alarm clears hall Families cling onto each other and ask whether they have all their belongings as they are evacuated from the building. All the while the children are screaming about their abandoned slush puppies and toys. Everyone is told to move away from the building after what seemed like a serious fire. However, it is believed a drunken guest had smashed the fire alarm.  11pm - Doors banging, kids screaming As I try to sleep, the bass from the main hall can be heard among children screaming and doors slamming shut. I\u0027ve brought my own sleeping bag after hearing horror stories of blood-stained mattresses and filthy linen. Every breath I take I am inhaling more and more of the lingering second-hand smoke which clings to the walls, furniture and very atmosphere of the musty apartment. 3am - Parents squabbling with children I was awoken to the sound of what I thought was a fight kicking off outside my apartment. As I looked out into the corridor, parents were arguing loudly with their children in the doorway to their room. The row lasted around an hour before they eventually returned to their rooms. 4.10am - Screaming girl The sleepless night in hell continues as I\u0027m woken by the short sharp scream of a young girl. It seems to have come from near the squabbling, restless family - who to my annoyance refuse to sleep. 8.45am - Average breakfast The Queen Victoria is fairly quiet and there seems to be no staff in sight. It is a buffet again, which is all the camp offers in terms of cooked food. Segments of oranges, a fruit cocktail, toast, cereal or the main fry up in silver trays are the options available. But the sausages are spotted with transparent blobs of fat which are chewy to eat. Nothing tastes fresh, and it is fairly average.  10.15am - Huge queues for swimming pool Around 50 families are queuing for the swimming pool and have been for more than an hour with their children in just swimwear and a towel. One frustrated child - who clearly doesn\u0027t understand time yet - says why are they not open yet, it\u0027s stupid. The families are forced to wait a total of an hour and a half to be let into the swimming pool for their turn. The long wait was due to no lifeguards being present at the pool. 10.30am - Rammed pool The pool is rammed full of parents and children - each with around two square metres to swim and play and yet more are piling in. It has a capacity of 120 people, which is far too many for the size of the pool, in my opinion. The much-anticipated Flume feature of the pool is out of action due to a technical fault.  11.30am - Child cuts foot on broken pool tile A young child is hopping around in her swimming costume and towel with toilet paper wrapped round a bloody foot. Her father claims she had cut her foot on a broken, loose tile at the bottom of the pool. In images it appears many of the tiles on the bottom of the pool are either dirty or missing.  11.45am - \u0027Faeces\u0027 smothered on duvet I speak to another unhappy guest who is disgusted by his experience at Pontins. He shows me images of what he claims are human faeces on a duvet supplied by Pontins for a sum of \u0026pound8. Their mattress, he reports, also had smears of poo all over it. The family, who have come from Cardiff, claim they waited from 4pm until 11pm at night for clean bed linen for their children to finally go to sleep in. He says 99.9 per cent of people are unhappy here and have complained too.  12pm - Claims of mice and second pool injury Another family, living at the other side of the park in the chalets, claim mice have chewed through the furniture in their room. While a third family say their child lifted one of the loose tiles above his head in the swimming pool after cutting his foot on it. 1pm - Haven is the Ritz compared to this A pair of unhappy mums - who brought their kids down together - explain how they had bought bleach to clean their chalet themselves. We got bleach flash, wipes, everything to clean as the smell was like rot, damp, festering bodies. We had a conversation last night saying overall there\u0027s plenty for the children to do, entertainment\u0027s fine, but the smell of cigarettes was disgusting. We\u0027ve stayed in a lot of holiday parks, Butlins, Haven and this is the worst. Haven is like the Ritz compared to this. 2pm - Same activities, different day On the surface, there seems to be plenty of activities for the children and the whole family in the day time including Curling, Cine Racing, a Disco Bingo and photo opportunities with Pontins characters. However, when dissected this is nearly exactly the same as yesterday\u0027s daytime entertainment. And most of which needs to be paid for on-top of the accommodation price. When speaking with families at the end of my stay, many say there is not much to do for the kids in the day - and every day is the same.

The nurse from Leicester Royal Infirmary took it upon herself to usher patients to safety as a man ran through the waiting room with a weapon in January. She then approached knifeman Yusuf Aka before security guards tackled him to the ground. Despite going above and beyond her duty, Caroline has said that she was just doing her job.  Speaking for the first time about the horrifying incident, she said to the Mail on Sunday : When you sit at that desk you don’t know what’s going to come in, you get everything.  You just take it in your stride. It’s only afterwards you think, oh crikey. It doesn’t bear thinking about what might have happened.  The chilling CCTV footage was only revealed to the public once the 22-year-old was convicted last week. It shows how he stabbed a man in the back in a random attack and then began to tear apart the waiting room at the hospital. Caroline, who had been working a night shift on January 16 was assessing patients waiting to be seen as Aka walked in, wielding an eight-inch knife. Dressed in a hooded jumper and sunglasses he had walked up to the front of the building and stabbed a man in the back with the hunting knife.  As soon as he walked into the waiting room he threw his weapon at a member of staff and then launched a computer across the room. In the chaos of Aka grabbing pieces of hospital equipment to throw, Caroline tried to ring security. But she realised that she needed to act fast in order to protect the patients. She shouted Everybody out, go! and lead them to the room where security guards were based.

Rachael Kin, 28, was hospitalised for six weeks and had her large bowel removed after contracting ulcerative colitis - an inflammation of the colon. She felt that after the surgery she was judged for her appearance and began to feel isolated, so decided to challenge herself and take part in a beauty contest and be a role model for others with the same condition. Those feelings changed for her when she was announced the winner of the regional contest, and now she prepares to compete in the national leg of the competition. The funeral care worker said: I want to be the first contestant with a colostomy and hope to inspire anybody struggling with body confidence issues.  If I can help to prevent one person from going through what I did mentally then that for me is the real crown. Rachael, from High Wycombe, Bucks, was training for the London Marathon when she was rushed to hospital in July last year, leaving her nine-year-old daughter Maja in the care of her family. She said: I went from being fiercely independent to totally vulnerable. I couldn\u0027t walk unaided, couldn\u0027t brush my teeth, or have a shower independently. The IV steroids made my body unrecognisable and I lost all confidence. The former lingerie model said she didn\u0027t know anyone her own age who had an ileostomy, where a hole in the stomach is made to divert waste from the intestine into a special bag. Racheal said: I\u0027d lie awake at night questioning myself. Could I wear the same clothes, could I eat the same food, could I swim in a bikini, would I ever model again? The mother-of-one, who volunteers for a food bank charity, said she experienced discrimination, including from an acupuncturist who refused to treat her because it wasn\u0027t hygienic.  She added: My partner of four years struggled to accept what had happened, and discouraged me from embracing the change, seeing my ileostomy as something that should be kept private. It was heartbreaking to watch my relationship come to an end. My mental health deteriorated rapidly, and from a once confident young woman, I found myself hiding away from the world outside.

Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims braved the rain to join the Pope - after 500,000 free tickets were issued for the religious event in the 700-hectare park. Pope Francis was driven in a Popemobile as well-wishers waved flags, cheered and reached out to touch the pontiff. Many visitors said despite the weather and the long walk they wanted to show young people that faith is strong in Ireland, and to set an example for younger generations. Led by a 3,000 strong choir, the crowds joined in song after the Pope completed his lengthy journey through the congregation. All focus then turned to an altar below a huge white Papal Cross, as the pontiff - wearing a specially designed green vestment - began conducting religious proceedings.   Pope shares feelings of pain and shame at failure of church authorities to tackle clerical abuse in Ireland  Addressing the crowd, the Pope referred to his meeting with eight survivors on Saturday evening and said he wanted to take up what they had said to him and seek forgiveness. He listed a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by church figures, including industrial laundries and clerical cover-ups of sex crimes. On each occasion he asked for forgiveness.  The crowd applauded each time. We ask forgiveness for the abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, of conscience, and sexual abuses perpetrated by members with roles of responsibility in the church, he said. In a special way, we ask pardon for all the abuses committed in various types of institutions run by males or female religious and by other members of the church, and we ask for forgiveness for those cases of manual work that so many young women and men were subjected to.  We ask forgiveness. The Pope continued: We ask forgiveness for the times that, as a church, we did not show the survivors of whatever kind of abuse the compassion and the seeking of justice and truth through concrete actions. We ask for forgiveness. He gave his speech after the first day of his historic visit to Ireland was dominated by the bitter legacy of historical scandals linked to church abuse and mistreatment. While the Pope conducted his service, Belfast singer Brian Kennedy performed the John Lennon classic Imagine at the Stand for Truth rally in Dublin. Before a crowd of thousands, Kennedy revealed he had written a new verse for the song - which he said he was singing in the direction of the Phoenix Park.  The new verse began: Imagine there\u0027s no paedophiles, I wonder if you can. No need to rape or vilify, all of these thousands can. A large crowd had also gathered for a silent vigil in Co Galway, organised by a Manchester woman whose sister vanished from a mother and baby home, is taking place in Tuam. More than 100 people assembled at the Town Hall and planned to walk the 30-minute route to the former site of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home. The Say Nope To The Pope campaign, which includes survivors of clerical abuse, also gave emotional accounts of their lives. Youth worker Orlagh McGlade travelled to the papal mass from South Armagh along with friends, both religious and secular. I was struck by the amount of young people who are here, it\u0027s great to see, the 23-year-old said.  It\u0027s just unreal to see everyone coming together, and sometimes you think the faith in Ireland has been lost but when you see everyone here today its clear the faith is still alive and well. Earlier Pope Francis prayed for victims of abuse left scarred by painful memories during a visit to the holy Knock Shrine. During his speech he said no-one could be failed to be moved by stories of young abuse victims who were robbed of their innocence. The pontiff added: This open wound challenges us to be firm and decisive in the pursuit of truth and justice. I beg the Lord\u0027s forgiveness for these sins and for the scandal and betrayal felt by so many others in God\u0027s family.  I ask our Blessed Mother to intercede for the healing of the survivors and to confirm every member of our Christian family in the resolve never again to permit these situations to occur. Thousands of supporters waved flags for the Pope as he arrived at the famous shrine in Co Mayo on the second day of his Ireland visit. Well wishers cheered for him in his Popemobile as he toured through crowds of pilgrims gathered in the torrential rain. Pope Francis then entered the chapel at the shrine site for a period of silent prayer before addressing the crowds. Pope Francis yesterday used the Spanish word caca, which translates as excrement, to describe those who covered up for clerics who abused people in their care.  His comments came during his private meeting with eight people representing a wide section of those who were mistreated by members of the Catholic Church in Ireland. By visiting the Knock Shrine today, Pope Francis is following in the footsteps of his predecessor John Paul II, who arrived at the hallowed spot in Co Mayo in 1979. In August 1879, 15 people said they saw an apparition in Knock of the Virgin Mary, St Joseph, St John the Evangelist and a lamb. Around 1.5 million people now visit the site every year.  The Pope landed at Knock airport at about 9.30am ahead of his visit to the holy shrine. Four local schools greeted the pontiff in the heavy rain and around 100 schoolchildren from Co Mayo were waiting for him. They waved Vatican and Mayo flags. Maria Casey, marketing and communications manager at Knock Shrine, said: People started to come here in the hope of receiving cures, and Knock became synonymous for that. And people came to the spot of the apparition to get some clay or holy water to send to abroad. It has developed over the years and it has a very unique story in the sense that it\u0027s the only shrine in the world where the Lamb of God has appeared.

Despite some sunny spells, many people faced a miserable start to the three-day break, with the North particularly hit by rain. Although revellers at the Reading Festival enjoyed some sunshine, its sister event in Leeds saw crowds don hoods and plastic macs to keep dry. And the wet weather conditions are set to last until the end of today, forecasters warn. The Met Office has predicted bad weather across the country, with prolonged and heavy rain throughout the day.  Some areas could see winds hit 40mph as the bad weather hits. The poor forecast has seen today\u0027s Moto GP at Silverstone brought forward by 90 minutes. That decision came after downpours caused chaos and flooded the track.  But there is better news for Monday with a drier, brighter outlook despite some breezy conditions. However, the Met Office predicts a scattering of showers is still likely in the north. That will be followed by more sunny spells on Tuesday before rain falls in the northwest and moves southeastwards into Wednesday. But there could be better news on the horizon, according to long-range forecasts.  Models show higher than average temperatures could last until November. September is likely to see a good deal of dry, warm and settled weather, the Met Office says. Its forecast for the next 30 days states: Daytime temperatures are expected to be above average overall, especially across the south and east. It may become very warm for a time, and with the warmer conditions perhaps spreading further north and west with time.

Victoria Andrews, 26, was shocked to learn she was pregnant after doctors told her she was infertile due to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Yet she gave birth to baby Tobias – Toby for short – in May. And while Victoria has had to sell half of her collection to buy things for her real baby, Toby still has 40 doll brothers and sisters. He even has a ‘twin’ - an identical version of a sleeping newborn Toby. Victoria said: “I couldn’t believe it when I found out I was pregnant. “Obviously I love babies. I just thought I would only ever have the doll variety.  “I was smitten with Toby right away. He’s got my eyes and my ‘bum’ chin. I haven’t even picked up a doll since he was born.” Victoria only learned she was pregnant after going to the doctor after weeks of what she thought was a stomach ulcer or gastroenteritis. She said: “My blood tests came back. The doctor talked to me for a few minutes and then said ‘congratulations by the way, you’re at least seven weeks pregnant.’” The barmaid still didn’t believe it – so she paid for a private scan. “It was only when I saw his tiny body that I started to celebrate,” Victoria said. “I was so happy.” Last year Victoria started taking Infolic - a drug her mum found online that was meant to halt the facial hair growth polycystic ovary sufferers often have to deal with.  But it seems the medication also resulted in a spike in the barmaid’s fertility. Victoria said: “I’d tried so many different things in the past that hadn’t worked it didn’t really occur to me that this one might. I wasn’t even taking it for my fertility. “Me and my partner at the time didn’t use protection – there was no need. “We split up before I even knew I was pregnant because I found out he was cheating. “Now he doesn’t want anything to do with the baby. It’s massively his loss – Toby is absolutely amazing.” As a single mum Victoria had to offload some dolls to help make ends meet.  She made nearly \u0026pound10,000 selling about 40 dolls – called ‘reborns’ — and spent the money on a cot, pram and other necessities for Toby. At its peak her collection had over 100 dolls. Although she has always buys and the sells the dolls in order to upgrade to better versions, Victoria reckons she has spent around \u0026pound60,000 on the hobby. Now, with a real baby, she no longer has time to pay attention to the 40 she still has left. Victoria said: “Some of the ladies in the doll community take their collections quite seriously. They with feed and bathe their dolls and put them into pyjamas at night. “I mostly keep mine on a shelf. “Sometimes, before I had Toby, I would pick them up for a cuddle if I was feeling down. It’s really soothing. “But now I’ve got him I don’t need to do that. I don’t have time. I haven’t even picked one up since Toby came along. “I’ve kept my favourites though. Some of the best ones I paid \u0026pound1,500 for.” "},{"url":null,"title":"james cameron a bleak week","story":"NewsopinionJames Cameron: \u0027A bleak week for the Donald, but this sorry saga will run and run\u0027Historian and expert on US politics James Cameron tries to predict what will happen next in the never-ending saga of Donald TrumpShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMirror22:36, 25 AUG 2018NewsopinionIt\u0027s been a long week in politics for Donald Trump admirers (Image: AFP)Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis week’s events have been very damaging for Trump, but there is still a long way to go before this scandal reaches its conclusion. Paul Manafort, the President’s former campaign chairman, was convicted of fraud on Tuesday. On the same day, Michael Cohen, Mr Trump’s former personal attorney, pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges. Both men are facing jail sentences. For now, Cohen’s plea is more significant. Cohen testified that he facilitated payments to two women, “in co-ordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office” in order to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen’s lawyer later confirmed that this candidate was Donald Trump. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is unlikely to bring charges against Trump, however, because he is the sitting president. This means that the main danger to Trump is his removal from office via Congress. Firstly, the president must be impeached through a simple majority in the House of Representatives.  After that, Trump would only be removed after a trial in the US Senate. A conviction requires two-thirds of senators to vote in favour. No president has ever been removed this way. Richard Nixon resigned before his impeachment vote, while the Senate acquitted Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson. The process is steeped in politics and there are a number of issues that need to be resolved before Trump’s fate becomes clear. Most importantly, the Republicans have majority control of the House of Representatives, so any impeachment attempt would almost certainly fail in Washington’s highly partisan political climate.

The porn actress spoke to the Sunday Mirror about her troubled childhood, estranged parents and her failed relationships. Her third marriage, to musician Glendon Crain, crumbled under the pressure of the Trump fallout. And she believes any chance of finding love again is doomed as she spends most of her time surrounded by bodyguards after death threats. Stormy revealed how she learned to stand up for herself at a young age. An only child, she claimed her mum Sheila Gregory virtually abandoned her, leaving her to go hungry in their filthy home in a downtrodden part of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Stormy, 39, told the Mirror: “I was about six when she first left me home alone with no food. It makes me upset that anyone would do that. “My daughter is much more brave and smart than I was at that age and I still can’t imagine that happening to her. I had to take care of myself, no one is going to do it for you. “Some people rise to the challenge and some people get stuck in that cycle of whatever their life is. “Maybe it’s poverty, maybe it’s drugs and alcohol, maybe teen pregnancy, maybe joining a gang. The cycle tends to repeat itself. “I didn’t want to do that. I wanted to prove everybody wrong.” Sheila, 64, has insisted she did all she could to support her daughter – working three jobs after Stormy’s dad Bill walked out. The rift, however, seems permanent. But while Stormy has completely cut herself off from her birth family, she has adopted a gay couple as her “parents”. She refers to both Keith Munyan and his partner JD Barrale as “Dad”. Keith, who befriended Stormy when she first moved to LA to work in porn, is godfather to her daughter.  He was one of four people who confirmed key elements of her alleged affair with Trump when she signed the original non-disclosure agreement. Stormy revealed how Keith and JD were horrified that Trump’s running mate in the 2016 election – and now Vice President – was Mike Pence, who has been slammed by the LGBT community over his stance on gay rights. She explained: “My adopted dads have replaced my real family, for sure. I live with them when I’m in LA. “When they heard Mike Pence was running, that was very upsetting for them. That was when sh*t got real. They were really afraid they weren’t going to be together, that was the hardest part, seeing people so close to me so upset and so devastated. “On election night, I was in my house in Dallas, texting them. I was trying to talk them down off a ledge, saying I’m sure the next result will be fine. But we all know how that turned out. They were really upset.” Stormy, who has appeared in porn movies and stars in a touring strip show in the US, has no regrets about her career. She says she wouldn’t stop her daughter, aged seven, following in her footsteps when she grows up.

In an exclusive interview, Stormy said that she:  Will give evidence to Congress against Trump if he is impeached. Has received death threats from the President’s supporters. Was reduced to tears by women who turned to her for support after suffering sex harassment. Learned to stand up for herself after a tough childhood in which she was left home alone without food.  Stormy spoke in the same week that Trump’s former lawyer Mike Cohen, 52, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws by paying her $130,000 “hush money”.  Another of the President’s alleged lovers, ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, 47, is said to have had her silence bought in a $150,000 deal with the pro-Trump National Enquirer. And fresh claims emerged yesterday that Trump, 72, also had a secret love child with a housekeeper. The President faces yet more \u0026shypressure on three fronts: The ongoing probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election a poll boost for rival Democrats which could hasten an impeachment vote and reported immunity for key figures helping the authorities probe hush money payments. Stormy told the Mirror: “If Donald Trump has done things he shouldn’t have during his campaign he should be impeached. If he has broken the law he should be arrested and treated like anyone else. “I’ll happily testify under oath and prove my story is true. “I have always said that the truth is the most important thing and that is why I spoke out in the first place – so I can look my daughter in the eye and know I was honest. Now the truth is coming out and justice must be done.” Stormy, 39, claimed she was initially intimidated into keeping silent and is suing both Trump and Cohen amid claims a non-disclosure agreement she signed is invalid.  She told us: “I will not be silenced, but being called a liar is the hardest part. I am glad other people are now telling the truth. I am just fighting for the truth and I believe everyone should be treated equally. Trump probably wishes he’d never met me, but a lot of men feel like that.” Last weekend the articulate mum of one turned down a reported \u0026pound750,000 to appear on Celebrity Big Brother after, she claims, Channel Five “screwed” her at the last minute. Stormy talked to the Mirror earlier this week at a secret location in the English countryside. She spoke about meeting Trump at a Lake Tahoe golf event in 2006. Stormy claims they had sex once then – and met up on two further occasions. The President has been swamped by accusations of sexually harassing women. But Stormy said: “I have to be very clear he DIDN’T do that to me, it was consensual. But if the allegations from other women are true he should be in jail.” Of her alleged fling with Trump, she said: “I’m normally such a prude! I don’t do one-night stands. “People would be surprised to know that outside work I have only slept with about 25 men. If I see a cute guy in a bar, I chicken out. But on this occasion I was intrigued by Trump. I like very interesting people.” Stormy is prevented from revealing intimate details due to her ongoing lawsuit. But she says she barely recognised Trump when they met. July 2006  Donald Trump meets Stormy Daniels at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, just four months after wife Melania gives birth to their son Barron, now 12. Daniels claims she had sex with the tycoon. October 2016 Daniels is paid $130,000 by lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet about the alleged affair, just weeks before voters go to the polls. She now claims she was intimidated into silence. November 2016 Trump wins the presidency, defeating rival Hillary Clinton in a result which sends shockwaves around the world. January 2018 The Wall Street Journal carries a report about the payment and names Daniels. Trump denies both the affair and any knowledge of the payment. March 2018 Daniels takes legal action against Trump in a bid to prove the non-disclosure agreement is not valid because he didn’t sign it. April 2018 Cohen’s office is raided by the FBI, which seizes emails, tax documents and business records. August 2018 Cohen admits breaking election laws by paying hush money to two women, believed to be Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claims to have had sex with Trump. She went on: “There were lots of people around but I didn’t go after him. I didn’t chat him up and he didn’t chat me up – we were just talking. I knew very little. I wasn’t a fan of his and I’d never watched The Apprentice. “He didn’t yell ‘You’re fired’, although I bet now he wishes he had.” At the time, the tycoon’s wife Melania, 48, was at home nursing their four-month-old son Barron. Washington is awash with rumours that Melania, now First Lady, feels trapped and miserable in her marriage. But Stormy said: “People should stop speaking for her. Maybe she’s happy. Everything we say about her is a projection. Some people misplace sorrow and pity on another person. “The entire world would be interested to know what she feels. But if we never know, that is her right and I support it.” Stormy said she forgot all about Trump until he ran for President – to her “amusement and disbelief”. During campaigning a tape emerged in which he boasted he could do anything with women because he was a “star”, adding: “Grab them by the pu**y.” Stormy said: “I’m shocked there are women who are okay with it. It’s my job to grab women and if I said that I’d get in more trouble than him.” It was in January this year that the story broke of Stormy and Trump’s alleged fling. Overnight, she became an icon for women who claimed they had suffered harassment – even though Stormy insists that her relationship with Trump was consensual. She went on: “I’d no idea I would end up standing up for everyone but it has been a privilege I never expected. “It’s hard enough to face these powerful people but to have others place their hope and trust in you is a big deal. I’m not a feminist, I’m just human.” Stormy revealed that one woman confided in her that her sister had killed herself after being raped. Others have said her experience encouraged them to report abuse and sexual harassment.  Stormy – who appears in US clubs in a touring strip show – said: “I sometimes go back to my dressing room after listening to other people’s stories and it just makes me want to cry. “Sometimes we all cry together. But I am there to do a job so I pull myself together and then get back on stage. “I can be standing completely naked on stage and a woman will start crying. I’m like: ‘Oh my God, I really just want to hug you’.” Stormy said standing up to Trump came at a price. In March, she received so many death threats that she had to hire two bodyguards who never leave her side. Some of Trump’s fanatical supporters have bombarded her with terrifying messages. One man approached her in a car park, said she had a lovely daughter and “it would be a shame if something happened to her Mommy”. Stormy added: “I’ve been told: ‘Watch out, b*tch I’m coming for you, I’m going to cut your throat’ – and ‘Your kid should be euthanised’. It’s horrible stuff.” Stormy has now left the UK for a secret location following the row over her last-minute exit from Celebrity Big Brother.

According to the Mail on Sunday investigators in Croatia and Italy have both decided that the air stewardess did in fact jump.  The paper reports the investigators saying she did so \u0027voluntarily\u0027 – and in a ‘determined’ fashion. However what caused her to jump remains unknown. Ms Longstaff has not spoken in public since the rescue despite several contradictory reports about her potentially rowing with her partner the night she disappeared overboard. Croatian officials say CCTV images show Kay was alone at the time of the incident at 11.45pm on Saturday, 60 miles off the coast.  Her partner Craig Rayment was said to be in bed when the drama unfolded. The electrician reported her missing at 2am, several hours after she vanished. The 46-year-old will not have to contribute to the cost of her rescue, thought to run into several hundred thousand pounds. Croatia’s Ministry of Maritime Affairs said ‘international agreements’ prevent Croatia from forcing the woman to pay up. American Eddie Palladino, 60, who was on the cruise with his wife and two children, told The Mirror: “We were woken up by alarm bells going off and then there was an announcement from the captain.

He was traced there and was seen by officers to be heavily under the influence of alcohol.”Kilcullen was then taken to police HQ on West Bell Street, where he gave a reading of 149 mics.“Given the high reading he was kept in custody to appear in court on the complaint on December 27,” the fiscal said.Solicitor Gary McIlravey said Kilcullen, who has no previous convictions, would lose his job as a consequence.Mr McIlravey added his client had “an underlying drink problem which had not been addressed” and had self-presented at Tayside Counsel on Alcohol.“He is on a total abstinence programme with them. This was a wake-up call for him and he has not buried his head in the sand,” the solicitor said.Kilcullen admitted that on December 24 on Montague Street, Strathmore Street, Nursery Road, Balgillo Road, Edzell Street and Dunshelt Road, he drove with excess alcohol in his blood.Sheriff George Way told Kilcullen: “The consequences of this will be very significant for you in terms of your employment and your ability to earn. It was a very, very high reading, but you are not a boy racer.”The sheriff fined him £500 and disqualified him from driving for 30 months.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee fans heading to st

safranko admits understanding the dundonian accent has been his biggest hurdle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United new boy Pavol Safranko has revealed the biggest hurdle he’s encountered since arriving has been learning to work out English – Scottish-style.The Slovakian international was an instant hit in Tangerine as he scored a cracking debut goal in the 2-0 win at Queen of the South a fortnight ago.And from what he’s seen of Scottish football so far, the 23-year-old is feeling good about fitting in to life in the Championship with United.Having already switched countries successfully once when he moved from Dunajska Streda in his homeland to Danish outfit Aalborg last year, he did not anticipate too many problems with getting used to the culture here.Particularly as his language of choice in Denmark was very often English.“I was one year in Denmark and everyone speaks English and I thought this is good for me coming here,” he said.“But when I came to the training ground from Dundee for the first time, the taxi driver spoke with me and I didn’t understand anything.“I had to ask him two or three times to say again before I understood what he said. It was not a big problem because he was a nice guy.“I will try to learn the accent here and it will happen but when I arrived it was more difficult to understand English here than I thought it would be.”While learning to speak, or at least understand, Dundonian, Safranko will also be reading up on the opposition he’s going to face in the Championship, starting with today\u0026#8217s visitors Partick Thistle.For him, though, the most important factor being at Tannadice will be getting to know his team-mates and focusing on playing to his and their strengths.“I do not know Partick Thistle. I do not know too much about any of the other clubs, so we have to see some videos, play games, and after I can say something about our opponents.“I think this can be a good thing. You always have to start from the ‘us’, from what we will do and not think too much about the other teams. This is a good way to build the winning mentality.“It’s more important to learn about team-mates than the other teams. I have had three weeks training now, that helps.“And it is important that we are winning games while we are learning about each other. There are many new players here and we will get better as a team but we must win while this happens.”With that impressive debut coming down in the Dumfries, for most United fans today will be their first glimpse of Safranko.Giving them a preview of what to expect he’s told them to look for him in the penalty box. He knows that’s where his worth to the team lies and that is where he wants to spend most of his time.“I am a striker who gets into the penalty box. This is my area to play. Hey, I am not good outside the box – I know where I am and that is where I play.“I hope this is good for United and that it is where we will play. Then I can help the team and that is what is most important.“We were good in my first game and we were the better team first half, so we were attacking.“Maybe not second half but we won. I hope the second game will be even better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd04af1b5a-836x564.jpg ","title":"elton ngwatala dundee players must trust each other to turn form around","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBelief is key for Dundee, says Elton Ngwatala, if they are to chalk up their first league points of the campaign.The Dark Blues will make the short journey to Perth to take on Tayside rivals St Johnstone in what has become a crucial fixture.The Dens men go into the clash stuck on zero points after two Premiership games keen not to repeat their slow start to last season.It took last year’s team until mid-September to register their first victory of the campaign – notably against today\u0026#8217s opponents, Saints, in a 3-2 victory at Dens Park.To repeat that, Ngwatala – one of the summer recruits – insists it’s about the players trusting each other to earn themselves a first win of the campaign.The Frenchman said: “Last week was, obviously, a very disappointing result for us but I think we have to look forward now.“We are back in the league matches and we have to start winning games, that’s the most important thing.“We can take a lot from the last game and learn from our mistakes. We will do everything we can to win but we have to score as well.“Obviously, we can do so much better than we have done.“Everybody in the team knows that but we have to improve and keep improving every week.“Now, everybody is on it. Everybody wants to do the best for the team, whatever the starting XI or subs, everybody wants to be part of it and we need that to be successful.”Before the 3-0 home loss to Championship side Ayr United, Dundee’s big problem was putting away the chances they were creating against St Mirren and Aberdeen.The defeat to the Honest Men has put a whole different spin on the club’s start to the season, however.Ngwatala, though, says there is plenty of talent in the current squad to create a positive twist in the story of Dundee’s season tomorrow at McDiarmid Park.“The first two games, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” he added.“That’s the way it is, though, and now I think we have to be prepared to fight every game.“As a team you have to give everything to get the win.“Even if we have to wait to score in the 95th-minute we’ll do that – you have to believe to the end.“We have to go there with confidence and express ourselves and do the best we can to get the three points.”And Ngwatala says the points will only be heading their way if they can work as a team and trust each other to get the better of their Tayside rivals – that’s the message from boss Neil McCann, anyway.“The manager has said we have to believe in ourselves, believe in what we can do and trust each other.“If we do that, we’ll get what we deserve.“It’s going to be a tough game – we have to treat this game like any other and prepare like we would against any team.“We must go there and do everything we can to get a result.”In those two league games, getting anything positive on the scoresheet was a big issue with Ngwatala the only Dundee player yet to find the net.He’s pleased to have got off the mark in goalscoring terms but would much rather have points on the board.“It was good for me to get the first goal so now I’m relaxed, the first is gone and I can carry on now.“However, I need my teammates to help me score and I will help them to do the same.“I want to score but when I do, I want my team to win, not just get a goal and we lose the game.“I want to help my team get points, that’s all I want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd016034e9-e1535108915987-720x564.jpg ","title":"feat of strength recognised at holyrood","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee-born nurse who became the first woman in almost half a century to conquer a remarkable test of strength has been congratulated by the Scottish Parliament.Leigh Holland-Keen, 29, lifted the Dinnie Stones – two granite boulders that together weigh 733lb – in front of a crowd of 400 people.She was the first female in 40 years to do so and one of fewer than 100 people who have accomplished the feat.Ms Holland-Keen, who now lives in Australia, made history at Potarch, on Deeside, where the stones sit outside the Old Potarch Hotel.A North-East MSP has now marked the Sydney strongwoman’s feat with a motion at Holyrood.Scottish Conservative Alexander Burnett said: “Fewer than 100 people have managed to lift the stones since Donald Dinnie carried them the length of the Potarch Bridge in 1860.“Leigh was the first woman to do so in about 40 years.

But contemporary photographs held in the city’s archives show that 31-33 Castle Street was not demolished.The sandstone building was annexed and included in the design and construction of the new Caird Hall complex and received a fresh, modern appearance.Unfortunately, history buffs can no longer see the castle rock as the final touches to the building included the provision of false walls and new flooring in the basement.The former Kennedy’s Steak House closed several years ago and has lain empty ever since.The council-owned building had slipped into a state of disrepair.In a bid to attract a new occupant to the site, an “extensive” refurbishment of the building is under way.In all, £183,000 has been set aside to strip out the unit and make it ready for a new tenant to move

chance he gets this campaign with both hands.The 19-year-old featured in the two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into life quickly in Dundee and says the possibility of first-team football at a club with the stature of the Dark Blues was a big draw for him.“It was a quick six months at Colchester before the opportunity came about up here,” he added.“It’s a good club, I love it here, the people are friendly and I think I can learn more up here and maybe break into the first team.“The manager definitely gives young players a chance if he thinks they deserve it.“He believes in the youngsters and I am very grateful for the chance I had last season.“Hopefully, I can get more this year.“We play the same way as the first team and it’s all the same at Dundee so it’s not too much of a step up from reserve football but it’s older men with experience and you just have to put yourself about.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"life long dundee fan liverpool midfielder charlie adam linked with move away from stoke bolton wanderers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fan Charlie Adam looks set for

Whether or not either is fit to start on Saturday remains to be seen.A swollen knee means Murdoch hasn’t played since the Betfred Cup tie against Alloa a month ago.Whereas Booth’s absence stretches back a few days longer, to when he picked up a knock at Ross County in his only competitive appearance so far.Just the fact both are back working normally, however, is good news for their gaffer, though he remains frustrated by the continued absence of winger Billy King because of a thigh injury.“Callum Booth has trained with the team and also Stewart Murdoch has trained fully with the team, so they are now fit.“Billy King is still struggling with this stupid injury that he didn’t even get from training,” added Csaba.“He hasn’t done one training session so far this season.“Last season he was one of the most important players for the team but he is struggling with this injury and it continues to affect him.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.568496.jpg ","title":"today fun day hopes to boost dundee community spirit and revive high street","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHopes are high that a fun day in Lochee will revive some community spirit while offering activities for the whole family to enjoy.\u0026nbspOrganised by volunteers from multiple community groups including The Village of Lochee Community Partnership, Lochee Community Hub and Lochee Parish Church, today\u0026#8217s event is funded by the Community Regeneration Forum.Visitors to the High Street will be able to enjoy a performance by the Lochee Music Group, as well as appearances by Peppa Pig and Spider-Man.Meanwhile, along at the community hub there will be face painting, crafts, balloon modelling and a cake and candy stall.Lochee Library will also be involved, offering an opportunity to peruse stalls, get involved in some craft activities and enjoy an animal handling station.There will be some outdoor pursuits at the community garden, such as planting and a mini-garden festival, and refreshments will be available.

It’s the only reason I put myself through it.”Claire’s commitment to the charity began in 2012 after collecting donations at her grandmother’s funeral.“Alzheimer Scotland was our first choice.”But only then did Claire’s family discover the charity relied on fundraising.“We were shocked and it became the catalyst for me to want to get involved and help.”Claire’s first endeavour was a sponsored skydive.“It was totally exhilarating and amazing. An adrenaline buzz like no other,” she said.In 2013, Claire ran the Baker Hughes 10k and also the Great Scottish Run in Glasgow, completing them both in just over an hour and taking her sponsorship money close to £4,000.In between running her beauty business six days a week, Claire also made time to squeeze in training as a fitness instructor in 2015.The seeds of entering the London Marathon were then sown.“I applied in the ballot to run but I didn’t get a place,” said Claire.“I spoke to Alzheimer Scotland and through them I secured a charity place, which I was really grateful for as it afforded me the experience.”Claire followed the London Marathon 17-week running plan.She trained in the snow, wind and rain. The coldest day she ran was -5C.It took considerable commitment to follow the running schedule.Claire would rise at 6am and run between four to six miles in her short sessions.But come the weekend, her long runs, which were between two to five hours, would involve navigating her way along the Old Deeside railway line.The longest she ran ahead of the race was 21-and-a-half miles.So does Claire plan to run another marathon?“I will carry on raising money for Alzheimer Scotland, but I can honestly say I will never run the marathon again.“It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience but I simply can’t dedicate as much of my life to running ever again,” she said.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"boy finds pet cat strung up by neck","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA nine-year-old boy found his cat fighting for its life after yobs hung the animal from its neck with a dog lead.Ricky Henderson, from the Garthdee area of Aberdeen, today told how his wife Gail, 34, and son Cole, 9, found their pet Scruffy.A thick dog’s lead had been tied around the cat’s neck and attached to the top of a high fence near their home.The 33-year-old, who is assistant manager at Goals, said: “They realised they hadn’t seen him all day and then they heard him crying out the back.“My nine-year-old son found him on the fence struggling for his life.“He was round the back hanging on the end of a high fence.“He was soaked to the bone and his fur was on the fence because he must have been rolling around.

She said: “There’s always going to be nostalgia for the place.“Our project co-ordinator has been here for a long time, we’ve got a member of staff who’s been here for 20 years, so it’s part of their life. I’d imagine it’ll be emotional.”The nursery moved from Logie Place into purpose-built premises within the Hub, on Manor Avenue, in January last year.According to Marie, the move has dramatically improved the quality of the nursery, with more children being able to attend, increasing the catchment area they can serve.Marie said: “Before, we could only serve Middlefield, but now we can take children from Heathryfold, Cummings Park, Marchburn and other places in the local area, so more people are really seeing the benefits.”The new facility has also improved the quality of care, she added.“It’s greatly improved the facilities that we have – it’s a purpose-built nursery and the space we have is much bigger, and it’s much more open plan,” Marie said.“We have better access to the outdoors – the doors open up into the nursery garden, which was always our vision, to give the children a choice.”Transport Scotland announced that the demolition will take place between 1.30 and 2pm on Monday.A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland is pleased to accommodate the request of Middlefield Community Project Nursery for the opportunity to visit the site during demolition of their former premises, which are part of the ongoing works being carried out in preparation for the A90/A96 Haudagain Improvement Project.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first wave of runners get great aberdeen run

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Consistency, however, paid off for Inveraray as they were crowned Grade 1 Champion of Champions across all five major competitions during 2018 \u0026#8211 for the third year running.In Grade 4B, a young Mid Argyll Pipe Band kept up the momentum started in May when they won the British title. Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang, they performed tremendously well all season. A fourth place finish in the world championship ensured Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the Grade 4 Champion of Champions title for 2018.Early excitement for the Mid Argyll drum corps \u0026#8211 when they were awarded the drumming Champion of Champions crown \u0026#8211 turned to disappointment by the beginning of this week when the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association amended the result. The Mid Argyll drummers were tied on points with Lower Clyde Pipes and Drums across the season but the fact Lower Clyde got a better result on the day put them just ahead, leading to confusion.Craig Lang said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been a historic season for the band, being crowned British champions in May, then going on to win Champion of Champions on Saturday, an unbelievable achievement for such a young group.\u0026#8216Myself and lead drummer Graeme McMillan are immensely proud of every member. The work they have put in over last year has been admirable and  we hope we have given Mid Argyll a band to be proud of.\u0026#8217Pipe Major Stuart Liddell of Inveraray and District was pleased with his band\u0026#8217s result, commenting: \u0026#8216It has been another fantastic season for the band \u0026#8211 having been second in four of the five championships, winning the Europeans in Forres and securing the Champion of Champions for the third consecutive year.\u0026#8216The competition this year has been of a very high level and has been interesting to see four different bands lift titles \u0026#8211 Scottish Power (British), St Lawrence O\u0026#8217Toole from Ireland (UK and Scottish), ourselves (European) and Field Marshall Montgomery \u0026#8211 who have just been crowned the world champions for the 12th time under Pipe Major Richard Parkes, equalling the record set by the legendary Pipe Major Ian McLellan of Strathclyde Police.\u0026#8216It is great to be included amongst these great bands and the consistency is reflective of all the hard work that goes into it.\u0026#8217Elsewhere, in Novice A, Oban High School came second behind Dollar Academy.Kintyre Schools came an excellent fifth in a Novice B competition featuring 19 bands from across the globe.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"youth shinty takes macaulay centre stage","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/08/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPrior to the senior shinty Macaulay Cup Final on Saturday August 18, three Argyll and Bute district teams contested a round-robin tournament at the nearby rugby club.The tournament featured S1 teams representing Oban/Ballachulish, Mid Argyll and Cowal and Bute.Mid Argyll were up first against the Oban area team.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.

some 17 years ago, I lived on High Askomil for 25 years and before that about eight years on Low Askomil, both overlooking the beach.Long before when I was a teenager I lived in one of the prefabs on Hillside Road.My friends and I would often head for Dalintober beach, commonly known as Banana Beach, where we would spend some pocket money on Jock Shields\u0026#8217 kayaks.There were about six or seven kayaks to hire for a shilling or two and go just about anywhere, in all weathers, for an hour, not a life jacket to be seen.Jock or John Shields ran a bicycle shop on Longrow but was into many things and also had a ship carousel at Banana Beach.The carousel wasn\u0026#8217t unlike one at the fair but consisted of seven or eight little cargo ships and cruise boats, all home made I think, for one child in each boat.They were attached to a centre spindle with one ship only having an outboard motor making the whole assembly rotate.I\u0026#8217m not sure if it was Jock or someone else who hired out rowing boats from the slipway in the harbour.We would hire two seater or four seater boats, the former being cheaper and we could always pick up another crew member when out of sight of the hirer.Rowing  to the large mooring buoy in the middle of the loch was no big deal, neither was accepting a dare to ride out the wake from the Duchess of Hamilton or Montrose sideways on.I\u0026#8217m sweating thinking about it as there were no lifejackets, we must have been crazy.Other memories of Banana Beach were the toilets and shelter at the top of the pier now long gone, and the push button drinking fountain at the wall near the beach slipway.Happy days indeed.  Good luck to those trying to restore it for today\u0026#8217s generation where I\u0026#8217m certain lifejackets will be in

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands variously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman (Hermon) Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 (1952).’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"Festival guests left feeling cheesed off call for a refund","story":"  The Big Cheese Festival, which was held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":null,"title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.

She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.

He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.

If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.

Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy.

With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.

The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5 (accumulate) this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent (12 per cent more than last year and the highest value in four years).  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes (East) and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

The investigation is into two complaints of incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the First Minister\u0026rsquos official residence in 2013.  Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.  Ms Sturgeon said that she was initially made aware of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself.  She said: \u0026ldquoAlthough I have been aware for some time of the fact of the investigation \u0026ndash initially from Alex Salmond \u0026ndash I have had no role in the process, and to have referred to it before now would have compromised the integrity of the internal investigation, which I was not prepared to do.  \u0026ldquoHowever, I was informed by the Permanent Secretary earlier this week that she had completed her investigation and that she intended to make the fact of the complaints public.  \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond is now challenging the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedure in court.

With lots of second and third cousins in the city it seemed ideal when a teaching post was advertised in a Catholic primary school in nearby Glasgow.  After a successful interview, the usual background checks and an endorsement of her teaching credentials by the General Teaching Council for Scotland she had already started packing when the Home Office advised Glasgow City Council her visa had been rejected.  With her future in turmoil, Ms Farrell will now have to stay in America while the vacant post at St Angela\u0026rsquos Primary School, in Darnley, is re-advertised and she goes through the same visa process again.  \u0026ldquoIt was a dream come true for me to be allowed to enter Scotland to teach. My family is from Scotland so for me this almost feels like coming home, she said.  \u0026ldquoMy paternal grandparents are originally from Paisley and that was the the main reason for my desire to go abroad and teach. I thought I would be coming full-circle if I could return to their home country and teach in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis is a goal that I have been working towards for over a year and I have invested a lot of time and money into this process. I also resigned from my teaching post in Virginia and moved my life back to my parents\u0026rsquo house before the move to Scotland.  \u0026ldquoDue to this setback it seems that I am in limbo, living back home with my parents without a job. It is still my goal to come to Scotland, and I am hopeful that it will happen because I know I can be an asset. I just need someone to give me that chance.  Despite widespread teacher vacancies across Scotland and a particular shortage of approved Catholics in the denominational sector, Ms Farrell was declined under the complex Home Office points based system.  Because the Westminster Government\u0026rsquos monthly immigration cap has already been reached it means all applicants are judged against each other on a set of criteria - including salary levels.  Those in occupations where there are shortages, such as the medical sector, are given priority with the rest of the places allocated according to factors such as level of salary or qualifications.  Teaching is currently not viewed as a shortage occupation and does not command the same sort of salaries as other professions.  Glasgow City Council has now re-advertised the post with the hope that the visa application will be successful at the second attempt.  Ms Farrell is also hopeful she will be soon be able to pursue her dream move.  She said: \u0026ldquoI was heartbroken when I received word that my sponsorship had been refused, but I am very fortunate that Glasgow has not given up on me and they still are going to reapply for the sponsorship.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said: \u0026ldquoFollowing a successful interview the teacher has been offered a job in Glasgow and we will do everything in our power to help her secure the correct documentation in order to teach.  A Home Office spokeswoman said the government recognised the contribution of international teachers, but the immigration system was designed to ensure employers \u0026ldquolooked first to the UK resident labour market before recruiting from overseas.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhen demand exceeds the monthly available allocation of places, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupation.  \u0026ldquoNo occupation on the shortage occupation list \u0026ndash which is based on advice by the independent Migration Advisory Committee \u0026ndash has been refused a place.  The Home Office is currently looking at creating more flexibility in the system by creating a specific category for doctors and nurses which will free up more places for other occupations.  Research by The Herald earlier this month revealed there were nearly 700 teacher vacancies at primaries and secondaries across Scotland.  Councils facing some of the most acute shortages include those in the North East such as Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray, but there were also shortages in Glasgow.  Teaching unions argue the main problem is pay and conditions with the increasing workload of staff putting off recruits at a time when salaries have declined in real terms.  Glasgow also has an issue with the number of teachers with Catholic approval in its denominational sector.  It is not uncommon for there to be at least 40 teachers working in the sector who don\u0026rsquot have approval every year because of the wider shortages.  In 2016 Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, president of the Catholic Education Commission, said there would be \u0026lsquosignificant consequences\u0026rsquo for Catholic education should the \u0026lsquoacute\u0026rsquo problem not be addressed."},{"url":null,"title":"vicky-allan-argento-allegations-say-its-time-for-mentoo","story":"  The then 37-year-old had also, it was revealed, paid the actor off to the sum of around \u0026pound300,000. Although she issued a denial that sex had taken place, photographs emerged which appeared to show them lying together.  A story like this was probably bound to hit #MeToo at some point. Indeed, the movement has already had its debate over what our reaction should be if a #MeToo victim looks to also be an abuser, when Junot Diaz, after writing of his childhood abuse, was accused of sexual misconduct himself.  But the impact of the Argento allegations is different \u0026ndash for she has been such a key icon of the movement. An early accuser of Harvey Weinstein, she once threatened other abusers: \u0026ldquoWe know who you are, and we are not going to allow you to get away with it any longer.  Personally, I don\u0026rsquot think this is a bad moment for #MeToo. This is where the movement has to come of age, to acknowledge complexity, take in male survivors, and shift its image away from being a movement for a female celebrity elite. Where it goes from here is dependent on how it frames the problem of Argento, and its ability to remind the world that it is a movement not of flawed and complex leaders, but about principles. That hasn\u0026rsquot happened yet.  What do we do with a problem like Argento? The accusations against her do need to be taken seriously. They\u0026rsquore also a reminder that we need to look at the way women too may abuse their power. She was, notably, his director and co-star when he was seven.  Does that mean I believe Jimmy Bennett and not Asia Argento? I certainly don\u0026rsquot disbelieve him. The #MeToo credo has always been to believe the accuser. That has never, it has seemed to me, been what\u0026rsquos most important. What, above all, we owe victims is not to discredit them.  Yet Argento \u0026ndash unsurprisingly given she is the accused, yet hypocritically given she is #MeToo \u0026ndash has discredited Bennett, impugning him as a grifter, out for the money. It is this that has been hardest to square.  Not only that but, on social media, we see Bennett discredited by the public mob, just as we have seen so many female accusers discredited, including Argento. The tone is not quite the same, but there are similarities. He is cast as a gold-digger, someone who really wanted the sex \u0026ndash for after all what 17-year-old boy, so the story goes, wouldn\u0026rsquot? Stereotypes about young male sexual appetites abound.  What the Asia Argento story is a reminder of is that the question of who is a victim, who is a perpetrator, who is a survivor, who is an abuser of power, isn\u0026rsquot a matter of identity, but of relations. A person can be at one point in their lives a victim, and another an abuser. That\u0026rsquos the case, regardless of whether you are male or female \u0026ndash we all start out as powerless children.  The problem is the #MeToo movement failed, up till now, to embrace male survivors sufficiently. It was always a little \u0026ldquonot you too. There was always, and I was probably guilty of it myself, a tendency to use the word \u0026ldquoher too much, to frame the cause as a female issue.  But it\u0026rsquos possible for a movement like #MeToo to be about both Asia Argento as victim, and also Jimmy Bennett too. It can contain both. Dealing with that, and many other difficult questions, is key to its evolution.  Leave no stone turned ...  ENOUGH. I\u0026rsquom done with my long, adventurous career as an international beach pebble thief. No longer will I collect small cairns for my bathroom shelves. Nor am I going to continue to lead my children into this life of squalid crime. This, by the way, is not merely triggered by last week\u0026rsquos news story of how a man, threatened with prosecution for stealing stones from a Cornish beach had driven back to return them. Nor is it because I\u0026rsquove only just realised that under the Coast Protection Act1949, this is a crime. I actually quit long ago.  I suspect we\u0026rsquove all stone-thieved at some point. I think of it as one of our early instincts \u0026ndash the finding of a really good stone that fits perfectly into the palm of the hand. But, in these acquisitive times, it\u0026rsquos not just one nice stone, it\u0026rsquos a whole pocketful, or a bag, and then it gets out of control and your yard is like a shingle beach.  Now, there\u0026rsquos nothing really wrong with your small home cairn, but we do have a knack for turning beautiful things into stuff. Plus there are hordes of us \u0026ndash tourists, they call us \u0026ndash at it.  The stone that was a thing of beauty on the beach too often becomes a bit of clutter around the house. I know the temptation. I have it every time I visit the beach. Stone gathering is irresistible.  But then I look at my treasured pile and think to myself \u0026ldquobetter just leave it, they look loveliest here."},{"url":null,"title":"stuc-in-firing-line-over-relying-on-snp-government-for-60-of-funding","story":"  Leaked documents show that the STUC, which speaks for nearly 500,000 workers, received around 60 per cent of its income from Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos Government last year.  The \u0026pound2.6 million in public funding far exceeds the sum paid to the STUC in fees from its own members.  Meanwhile, the GMB union, one of the umbrella group\u0026rsquos biggest members, said in a statement that they had raised concerns about \u0026ldquotransparency and accountability in the running of the STUC.  Founded in 1897, the Glasgow-based STUC acts as the voice of the trade union movement and lobbies Government for policy changes. It represents the interests of members in 39 unions and 20 trades union councils, and is financed by affiliation fees.  Although the STUC is not aligned to a political party, the body had a high-profile role promoting devolution in the 1980s and 1990s.  However, senior trade union figures told this newspaper that the STUC, led by general secretary Grahame Smith, was too reliant on the Scottish Government and had lost its way.  The STUC is now facing questions about its relationship with the Government and the financial model on which the organisation is based.  Unlike the TUC \u0026ndash its UK sister organisation \u0026ndash the STUC is under no obligation to make its annual financial statements available outwith affiliated unions.  A spin-off firm, STUC Training Ltd, publishes accounts, but a detailed picture of the income of the body is not in the public domain.  According to documents presented to the annual congress in Aviemore this year, the STUC and its training arm had a combined income of around \u0026pound4.3m in 2017. Of this sum, less than 25 per cent came in the form of affiliation fees from trade unionists.  The biggest chunk of cash, \u0026pound2.3m, was given to STUC Training Ltd by the SNP Government for the \u0026ldquoScottish Union Learning initiative, which promotes skills and lifelong learning. Funds through the scheme are provided to the STUC, which distributes resources for different projects to help union members.  Another budget line also shows that the STUC received \u0026pound324,440 from the Government for the \u0026ldquoUnion Modernisation Fund.  This new pot was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a way of mitigating what she described as Tory legislation that \u0026ldquothreatens the unions. For every pound received by the STUC in 2017, around 60p came from the SNP Government, whose policies the civic body attempts to influence.  One critic of Smith\u0026rsquos leadership said the STUC had offered occasional criticism of the SNP Government, such as questioning rates relief for small business.  However, Smith is a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Standing Council on Europe and he backed the SNP Government position in the row over a Brexit \u0026ldquopower grab of Holyrood powers. The STUC also provided a mild quote in response to the findings of the SNP Growth Commission, a report that was widely criticised by figures on the political Left.  Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \u0026ldquoThe trade union movement is a vital part of public life and the defence of workers\u0026rsquo rights. They should always be utterly independent both of management and of Government. So to learn that the STUC gets the majority of funding from the Scottish Government puts that independence into question.  \u0026ldquoThey should be a champion for trade unions and of working people above all things, but many have been concerned that they have seemed to have pulled their punches recently over criticising the SNP Government on things like the austerity proposed by the Growth Commission.  Scottish Tory MSP Bill Bowman said: \u0026ldquoThe STUC is curiously quiet when it comes to criticising the Scottish Government.  \"Perhaps it\u0026rsquos a case of not biting the hand that feeds you.  \u0026ldquoIf the SNP Government is bankrolling the STUC, that explains why the organisation is so reluctant to question SNP decisions. No such problem seems to exist in relation to the UK Government.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a blatant conflict of interest here, and one which raises serious questions about the STUC\u0026rsquos ability to function transparently and responsibly.  A senior trade union figure said: \u0026ldquoThis is a serious situation for the STUC. Relying on external funding from the Scottish Government not only undermines the future sustainability of the organisation, it places a significant question mark over their ability to scrutinise and challenge Scottish Government policy making.  Separately, the STUC also faced criticism after an employment tribunal ruled that a staff member had been victimised by selecting him for redundancy.  The STUC failed to have the ruling overturned in an appeal and is in line for a hefty legal bill.  The Sunday Herald asked some of the STUC\u0026rsquos biggest affiliates for a comment on the tribunal case, but most did not provide a comment.  However, a spokesperson for GMB Scotland, one of the country\u0026rsquos biggest unions, said: \u0026ldquoThe judgment is troubling \u0026ndash victimisation in the workplace isn\u0026rsquot acceptable.  The statement added: \u0026ldquoOn numerous occasions we have raised our concerns about transparency and accountability in the running of the STUC, to defend the jobs and conditions of the staff we represent within the STUC and for the organisation\u0026rsquos ability to campaign effectively on behalf of all its affiliate members in future.  \u0026ldquoGMB Scotland will continue to seek to address those concerns through the internal processes of the STUC.  An STUC spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe funds received by the STUC from the Scottish Government are to fund learning and development projects run by our affiliated unions that provide learning opportunities for over 9,000 trade union members every year.  \u0026ldquoThese projects make a significant contribution to upskilling and reskilling the workforce and to our shared objective with the Scottish Government of achieving a more inclusive economy.  \u0026ldquoThe STUC is not dependent on Scottish Government funding. If this funding was not provided, thousands of low-paid, low-skilled workers would be deprived of the opportunity for personal and professional development.  On the GMB criticism, the spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere are multiple opportunities available to all of our affiliates to ensure we remain transparent and accountable, principally our Annual Congress which elects and holds to account our General Council on which members of the GMB serve.  \u0026ldquoConcerns raised by the GMB, which align with the specific issues mentioned above, have already been addressed directly with its Scottish secretary."},{"url":null,"title":"new-zealand-comic-rose-matafeo-named-funniest-at-the-edinburgh-fringe","story":"  Matafeo, 26, received the prize from Alan Partridge comedian Steve Coogan, who himself won the award in 1992.

The president, who mocked Mr McCain\u0026rsquos capture in Vietnam during the 2016 campaign, jabbed at the senator even after his illness for voting against Republican efforts to roll back President Barack Obama\u0026rsquos health care law.  Earlier this summer, Mr McCain issued a blistering statement criticising Mr Trump\u0026rsquos meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin.  Former presidents, including those who blocked Mr McCain\u0026rsquos own White House ambitions, offered emotional tributes.          Our statement on the passing of Senator John McCain: pic.twitter/3GBjNYxoj5          \u0026mdash Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 26, 2018  Mr Obama, who triumphed over Mr McCain in the 2008 election, said that despite their differences, Mr McCain and he shared a \u0026ldquofidelity to something higher \u0026ndash the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched, and sacrificed.  Mr Obama said the two political opponents \u0026ldquosaw our political battles, even, as a privilege, something noble, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home, and to advance them around the world.  Former President George W Bush, who defeated Mr McCain for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, called his one-time political rival \u0026ldquoman of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order and a \u0026ldquofriend whom I\u0026rsquoll deeply miss.  Mr Bush was among those expected to speak at Mr McCain\u0026rsquos funeral.          \u0026ldquoSome lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant, it is hard to think of them stilled. John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order. [\u0026hellip] Full statement by President George W.

Bush Presidential Center (@TheBushCenter) August 26, 2018  Mr McCain was the son and grandson of admirals and followed them to the US Naval Academy.  A pilot, he was shot down over Vietnam and held as a prisoner of war for more than five years. He went on to win a seat in the House and in 1986, the Senate, where he served for the rest of his life.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Mr McCain a \u0026ldquofascinating personality.  \u0026ldquoHe would occasionally be in a bad place with various members, including myself, and when this would blow over it was like nothing ever happened, Mr McConnell said Saturday after a Republican state dinner in Lexington, Kentucky.  \u0026ldquoHe also had a wicked sense of humour and it made every tense moment come out better.  Former vice president Joe Biden, who developed a friendship with Mr McCain while they served together in the Senate, said the Arizona politician will \u0026ldquocast a long shadow.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit that drove him was never extinguished: we are here to commit ourselves to something bigger than ourselves, Mr Biden said.

Other plans were taking shape, too.  Senator Chuck Schumer announced that he wants to name the Senate building that housed Mr McCain\u0026rsquos suite of offices after the Arizona senator, who served as chairman of the Commerce Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee.  \u0026ldquoAs you go through life, you meet few truly great people. John McCain was one of them, Mr Schumer said.  \u0026ldquoMaybe most of all, he was a truth teller \u0026ndash never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare.  Mr McCain\u0026rsquos wife Cindy said she was heartbroken by the death of an \u0026ldquoincredible man.          My heart is broken.

These masochists should be warned however \u0026ndash healthypatriot\u0026rsquos pop-ups present breaking news in an eye-catching font so deliberately vulgar it may cause infertility, sparking the evolution of conciousness in individual sperm who refuse to seed a world where such horror exists.  So, hoping to spare myself the butchery of a conventional vasectomy, I valiantly ventured into the article to learn how coconut oil has \u0026ldquoalready helped 47,187 people prevent, stop and reverse their Alzheimer\u0026rsquos and dementia symptoms. Perhaps the medical practitioners who calculated this suspiciously accurate number should also attempt to cure haemorrhoids, as they\u0026rsquore clearly good at pulling things out their a***.  Yet, I\u0026rsquom sold. I\u0026rsquom already online ordering all the coconuts a Tesco delivery guy can carry, confident I\u0026rsquoll forever be able to recall every tedious second of my unremarkable existence. This is because I\u0026rsquove been enchanted by a wee photo of healthierpatriot\u0026rsquos originator, a smiling middle-aged gent with a twinkle in his eye who goes by the solid, honest name of Martin Reilly.  He looks reassuringly trustworthy and professional, the kind of guy you wouldn\u0026rsquot mind telling you to get your affairs in order when the MRI results come through. He boasts that distinctly American jutting masculine jawline, which is perhaps a flattering optical illusion gifted by his strong, dominant nose and thick shock of white hair, artfully swept into a self-consciously unkempt side-shed. In essence, he\u0026rsquos Dick Van Dyke in Diagnosis: Murder.  Further study reveals Reilly\u0026rsquos belief that coconut oil has cost \u0026ldquoBig Pharma \u0026ndash that familiar warcry of every subconscious Scientologist \u0026ndash \u0026ldquotens of thousands of dollars to date, adding the substance has also \u0026ldquoexposed the fact that they have no intention of curing anyone of these devastating brain diseases. Apparently this \u0026ldquobrain food has been shown to reverse memory loss and cure Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in just 30 days, leaving \u0026ldquothe medical community stunned. And, presumably, the \u0026ldquocured praying for death\u0026rsquos sweet embrace to free them from the hell of having a sparkling mind imprisoned inside a dried-up septuagenarian sandbag body.  Yet, despite Reilly suggesting the existence of \u0026ldquostunned doctors, no names are cited and no-one is quoted. He\u0026rsquos not wearing a white coat either in his wee pic, and if we\u0026rsquove learned anything from toothpaste adverts, it\u0026rsquos that folk who hawk health products are legally obliged to don white coats \u0026ndash even if their qualifications come from a drama school rather than a medical one. On his healthierpatriot pop-up, Reilly confidently sports a suave V-neck sweater, the kind of thing David Bowie would have worn to the cricket.  How are we to believe him then? Should we simply be sold by his fatherly, dominant alpha demeanour alone? How can we be sure he even exists and isn\u0026rsquot just a stock image of a well-preserved, white American male?  Well, we google his name of course. And it seems Reilly is indeed a real person, a \u0026ldquoscience coach and writer of various unprovable and unverified theories concerning health and wellbeing. His \u0026ldquoMemory Repair Protocol programme claims to help individuals prevent dementia by using \u0026ldquonatural constituents such as coconut and cocoa. So if you eat enough Bountys it may be possible to recall the bliss of your mother\u0026rsquos womb. A superior advertising tagline to \u0026ldquothe taste of paradise I\u0026rsquom sure you\u0026rsquoll agree.  Reilly then attempts to win our sympathies, stating that he created the \u0026ldquoMemory Repair Protocol programme to treat his own wife\u0026rsquos Alzheimer\u0026rsquos, experimenting with various spices, vegetables, herbs and oily components that seemingly grease the wheels of biological impossibility.  Just when my critical faculties were eventually beginning to kick in, guiding the mouse arrow towards an incredibly small \u0026ldquox in the pop-up\u0026rsquos right hand corner, I found myself again drawn to Reilly\u0026rsquos\u0026nbspface, his twinky electric blue eyes shooting lasers that were kryptonite to cynicism.  In a desperate attempt to deflect his tractor-beam charisma, what remained of my clinical, objective mind somehow managed to drudge up some half-remembered trivia from the deepest bowels of my memory \u0026ndash a commonly known \u0026ldquofact that coconut oil zealots often employ. The proof of this oil\u0026rsquos powers, they assert, is illustrated by dementia-free indigenous populations in parts of the Philippines, India and Sri Lanka, where diets boast copious amounts of fresh coconut.  Yet, when applying cold logic to this initially intriguing happenstance, their healthy brains make perfect sense \u0026ndash undoubtedly the result of balanced diets that include copious amounts of fish, fruits, and vegetables, all completely free from any questionable chemicals or preservatives. Perhaps it\u0026rsquos no coincidence so many of us fall victim to dementia in the land of the pizza crunchie. On a roll, of course. Just like Martin Reilly and his business plan.  POISONOUS OR NOT, IT\u0026rsquoS ALL ACADEMIC  SOME advice: if you\u0026rsquore ever blissfully surfing the interwebs with your kecks down and find your activities interrupted by Martin Reilly\u0026rsquos Rasputiny eyes in an pro-coconut oil pop-up, strengthen your resolve by repeating the words of his nemesis \u0026ndash Harvard scientist Karin Michels \u0026ndash as a protective mantra: \u0026ldquoPure poison, pure poison, pure poison. Just note you may never see your kids again if your partner walks in.  This week, Michels enraged millions of pseudo-nutritionists and fad sheep around the world by emphatically stressing that coconut oil was, indeed, \u0026ldquopure poison and also \u0026ldquoone of the worst foods you can eat. Perhaps she has not yet crossed paths with the humble pizza crunchie. Or experienced this uniquely Scottish delicacy with the obligatory roll and skoosh of tomato sauce on the bottom and curry sauce on top. Wha\u0026rsquos like us?  Michel\u0026rsquos harsh words weren\u0026rsquot just attention-seeking bluster, however \u0026ndash they were fired off with the righteous intent of shaming countless con-artists who profiteer from hope and desperation. It\u0026rsquos a shame she didn\u0026rsquot sign off by clarifying that the dead don\u0026rsquot talk either. Yet, in reaffirming that all scientific evidence for coconut oil\u0026rsquos wondrous properties points to either placebo, divine providence or, simply, people talking p**h, Michels likely now regrets reawakening the somewhat ridiculous debate on the substance\u0026rsquos alleged benefits. Yet, like most myths, we must acknowledge that rumours of its magical properties were indeed borne from a small seed of truth.  Most of us consume oil, be it vegetable, sunflower, olive or, if your doctor legally prescribes it of course, cannabis. One special component of coconut oil is caprylic acid \u0026ndash which the body breaks down into \u0026ldquoketone bodies for cells to feed upon. Similar to Lucozade, compliments and MDMA, our brains really like these ketone bodies, and draw a considerable amount of energy from them.  Brain scans of people suffering from dementia show, logically, that affected areas use less energy. Coconut worshippers often work under the pseudo-scientific presumption that ketone bodies can give the brain the extra energy it needs to function \u0026ldquoproperly. However, the vast majority of neuroscientists, including Michels, dismiss this argument \u0026ndash countering simply that dementia-effected cells are either dead or dying. Unless you\u0026rsquore Kriss Akabusi, whom scientists believe has the highest-ever recorded levels of energy in a human and will never suffer from dementia or even die.  For the rest of us, ingestion of coconut oil has not once been scientifically observed to help diabetes, cancer, heart disease, chronic fatigue, Crohn\u0026rsquos disease, IBS, cancer, thyroid issues or any other condition which a new breed of snake oil salesmen claim are \u0026ldquocurable.  Selling a health product that has no positive effect is bad enough, but is coconut oil actually \u0026ldquopoison? Well, it\u0026rsquos certainly no worse then sugar or ciggies.  Michels\u0026rsquo main concern is the product\u0026rsquos gargantuan dollop of saturated fat, which in excess amounts has been linked to obesity and other serious health conditions. Yet, recent research has highlighted other factors such as genetics, lifestyle and smoking as more likely to increase cardiac risk than sat fat. Still, if you enjoy a fag as you wait for your chips to fry in coconut oil, perhaps it\u0026rsquos best to get your affairs in order now before an MRI scan confirms what you already know inside."},{"url":null,"title":"guitar-which-helped-propel-bee-gees-to-stardom-to-go-on-auction","story":"  The Gibson J45 acoustic was used by Maurice Gibb to compose the band\u0026rsquos 1975 breakthrough disco hit Jive Talkin\u0026rsquo, whose success led to the Bee Gees being offered the chance to contribute to the soundtrack of the hit 1977 film Saturday Night Fever.  It was the film\u0026rsquos soundtrack that breathed new life into the disco craze of the late Seventies and propelled the Bee Gees to global chart dominance.  Famously, Maurice, who died in 2003 aged 53, composed the track on the guitar after driving across a bridge in Florida and hearing the rhythm made by the car\u0026rsquos tyres on the road surface.  The guitar will be sold at Wiltshire-based auctioneers Gardiner Houlgate next month in what will be the UK\u0026rsquos largest ever auction of guitars.  Jive Talkin\u0026rsquo was the first single from the Bee Gees\u0026rsquo 1975 album Main Course, which marked the turning point in their career as they moved away from ballads, which were the hallmark of their early career, to disco.  The song was regarded as the Bee Gees\u0026rsquo comeback after a lull in popularity in the early Seventies.  In 1987, Maurice donated the guitar to BBC Radio 1 to give away as a prize on The Bruno Brookes show, for which it was autographed by all three Gibb brothers.  The prize winner subsequently sold the guitar on Channel 4\u0026rsquos Four Rooms show in 2014.  Also being sold is a second Maurice Gibb-owned guitar, an exceptionally rare custom-made 1968 Gibson EBS-1250 double-neck, which combines a bass and guitar into a single instrument.  The guitar was sold by Maurice in 1974 to another musician and collector, who has owned the guitar ever since. It is believed to be the only one of its kind made by Gibson in 1968.  Auctioneer Luke Hobbs said: \u0026ldquoBee Gees\u0026rsquo instruments are exceptionally rare and neither of these guitars has ever been offered for public auction before.  \u0026ldquoWe have great provenance on both. The J45 is well documented as the guitar on which Maurice Gibb composed Jive Talkin\u0026rsquo. We\u0026rsquove also got the letter from Radio 1 to the gentleman who won it.  \u0026ldquoMaurice was photographed performing with the doubleneck and he can be seen playing it on stage in a video on YouTube.  \u0026ldquoThese guitars represent the two great phases of the Bee Gees\u0026rsquo career.  \u0026ldquoThe double-neck comes from the Sixties and early Seventies when they sang popular ballads the J45 represents their comeback and the disco years.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not often you get to encapsulate a band\u0026rsquos career so succinctly in a single auction.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove over 400 guitars in September\u0026rsquos sale, making this the largest ever auction of guitars held in the UK, possibly the world. We\u0026rsquore expecting massive international interest.  Both Bee Gees\u0026rsquo guitars are being sold by UK-based private collectors and each is expected to fetch over \u0026pound10,000 when they are auctioned on September 12.  The Maton guitar used by George Harrison at the Beatles\u0026rsquo last appearance at Liverpool\u0026rsquos Cavern Club in 1963 will also be going under the hammer."},{"url":null,"title":"davis-accuses-chancellor-of-trying-to-frighten-people-over-post-brexit-economy","story":"  Former Brexit secretary David Davis lashed out at \u0026ldquobogus forecasts from the Treasury\u0026nbspafter the Chancellor suggested that GDP could fall and borrowing could be around \u0026pound80 billion a year higher by 2033/34 if the UK resorted to World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms.  In an op-ed in the Sun on Sunday he said that Mr Hammond was being \u0026ldquoeither spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate, adding: \u0026ldquoI know what I think.  Mr Davis\u0026rsquos intervention came as his successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested some fiscal projections needed to be treated with \u0026ldquoa measure of caution.  Writing in the Sun, Mr Davis, who quit in protest at Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers deal, said the Chancellor\u0026rsquos estimates, outlined in a letter to Treasury Committee chairwomen Nicky Morgan, came from a \u0026ldquoTreasury that has trouble forecasting deficits even 12 months ahead.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was an attempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal.  \u0026ldquoAnd even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government\u0026rsquos hand in striking a deal with the EU.  \u0026ldquoIf they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of.  Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.  Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos comments emerged hours after Mr Raab had attempted to play down the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit while outlining the impact of such a scenario via a series of technical papers.  Mr Hammond on Thursday was accused of launching a \u0026ldquododgy Project Fear with his letter.  The Chancellor said that his initial January analysis on GDP and borrowing was undergoing a \u0026ldquoprocess of refinement ahead of a parliamentary vote on any deal, noting scenarios which have higher barriers to trade with the EU are expected to have a \u0026ldquomore damaging effect on the economy and public finances.  He also defended the Government\u0026rsquos preferred approach, which was outlined in a white paper following a Cabinet summit at Chequers, by saying the economic and fiscal impacts of this would be \u0026ldquosubstantially better than no deal.  Mr Raab risked a Cabinet row with Mr Hammond after questioning the worth of economic forecasts about Brexit.  In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Brexit Secretary said that GDP estimates for 2019 \u0026ldquohave been revised up.  Without naming Mr Hammond, Mr Raab told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.  The newspaper also claimed that the Cabinet will meet to discuss no-deal Brexit preparations over fears that a row between Brexiteers and Remainers was undermining negotiations with Brussels.  Meanwhile, former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy warned that a no-deal Brexit could cause the United Kingdom itself to collapse.  The ex-Belgian prime minister told the Observer that crashing out without a deal was an \u0026ldquoan existential threat to the UK itself.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united.  \u0026ldquoThis talk about a \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo is the kind of nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era."},{"url":null,"title":"britain-set-for-wet-and-windy-spell-before-drier-monday","story":"  Parts of the UK could see almost two inches of rain (50 millimetres) and gusts of wind up to 45mph, the Met Office said.

Peter Grant, the Nationalists\u0026rsquo Europe spokesman at Westminster, recently warned that there was \"not a rope in existence that is strong enough\" to hold Scotland to the rest of the UK if the Conservative Government pursued a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit.  Last week, following the publication of the first tranche of papers setting out Theresa May\u0026rsquos no-deal contingency plans, Nicola Sturgeon claimed that quitting the EU without an agreement would be an \u0026ldquounmitigated disaster while her Scottish Cabinet colleague Michael Russell branded such a scenario a \u0026ldquonightmare.  In contrast, David Lidington, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos effective deputy, argued that a no-deal Brexit would in no way jeopardise the Union, saying the \u0026ldquostrength of the United Kingdom would continue regardless.  Earlier this month, the First Minister signalled that she was unlikely to be able to make a definitive decision on calling for a second independence referendum this autumn because of the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.  However, both Brussels and London have indicated that people will know by early November whether or not a deal is doable. Ms Sturgeon could make her key announcement within days of this development although Mrs May has made clear repeatedly that she would not facilitate a second independence poll before the next General Election due in 2022.  Commenting on Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have always said the United Kingdom would continue to thrive in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But we are confident of getting a good deal one that delivers for every part of the United Kingdom and takes back control of our money, laws and our borders. That is what this Government will deliver.  Ex-SNP MP John Nicolson tweeted: \u0026ldquoNot many up sides to #Brexit but this may be one. People are beginning to focus and ask, again, why we were so misled during #indyref We have a bright future, independent and in the #EU.\"  The ex-EU Council President told The Observer: \u0026ldquoThe no-deal issue is not just a problem for the UK or Brussels, it is also an existential threat to the UK itself.  \u0026ldquoOne can imagine that a no-deal will have a big impact and cause concern in some of the regions. Speaking of Scotland, it could have consequences for them and others.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united. This talk about a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo is the kind of Nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.  Mr Van Rompuy, the first person to hold the European Council presidency, also suggested that a no-deal outcome would almost certainly lead to fresh elections in Britain.  \u0026ldquoIf there is no House of Commons support for no-deal, then you are very close to new elections. If you have new elections, then Article 50 [the legal process for Britain\u0026rsquos exit] will have to be postponed because it will not be clear that you will have a government or a government with a programme.  The former Brussels chief highlighted the Commission\u0026rsquos main objection to Mrs May\u0026rsquos proposal: the separating out of goods and services, which it believes would give the UK a major economic advantage.  He explained: \u0026ldquoIt is rather difficult to make a distinction between goods and services. We are living in a new economy where there is a mix of goods and services for the same kinds of products. Saying that we will have a customs union, or even going further with a single market for goods, and completely separate it from a single market in services, this is what [chief EU negotiator Michel] Barnier called unworkable.  Mr Van Rompuy also decried what he called \u0026ldquoOperation Fear to put pressure on parts of the Conservative Party, making clear \u0026ldquothose threats will not work vis-\u0026agrave-vis the European Union.

The ex-Brexit Secretary and a leading Brexiteer accused the Chancellor of being \"either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate\", adding: \"I know what I think.\"  He accused the Treasury of having \u0026ldquotrouble forecasting deficits even 12 months ahead\" and said Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos comments were an \u0026ldquoattempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal.  Mr Davis went on: \"And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government\u0027s hand in striking a deal with the EU. If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.\"  The Chancellor\u0026rsquos no-deal warning emerged just hours after Mr Raab had attempted to play down the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit while outlining the impact of such a scenario via a series of technical papers.  Mr Hammond was accused by one pro-Brexit Tory colleague of launching a \"dodgy Project Fear\".  The Chancellor had pointed to his initial January analysis on GDP and borrowing but noted how this was undergoing a \"process of refinement\" ahead of the parliamentary vote on any deal.  He also defended the Government\u0027s preferred approach, which was outlined in a White Paper following a Cabinet summit at Chequers, by saying the economic and fiscal impacts of this would be \"substantially better\" than no-deal.  Mr Raab, in an interview with the Sunday Times, noted how the latest GDP estimates for 2019 had been \u0026ldquorevised up\".  Without naming Mr Hammond, he echoed Mr Davis, saying: \"I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.\" He suggested such fiscal projections had to be treated with a \u0026ldquomeasure of caution."},{"url":null,"title":"vince-cable-not-relinquishing-party-leadership-any-time-soon-says-lib-dem-hq","story":"  It is suggested that the MP for Twickenham will use his keynote speech to the Lib Dem conference in Brighton next month to propose plans to allow people to run for the party leadership who are not an MP.  This would, of course, open the way for MSP and former MP Willie Rennie, currently the leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, to seek the bigger role.  When Sir Vince succeeded Tim Farron as party leader following the 2017 General Election, there was speculation that he had done so as a caretaker that his deputy Jo Swinson, the 38-year-old MP for East Dunbartonshire - who gave birth to her second child in July - would take over at some stage before the next General Election. This is due on May 5 2022, within four days of which Sir Vince will enter his 80th year.  Asked about the prospect of Sir Vince standing down as leader, a party source said: \"He\u0027s not about to stand down or use the speech to stand down. There are no plans to step down any time soon.\"  It is expected that the Lib Dem leader will at conference unveil proposals to create a registered supporters scheme, similar to the one that allowed 180,000 people to vote in the Labour leadership elections.  Rules will also be rewritten so that supporters will need to be enrolled for at least 12 months before voting, to prevent any infiltration or undue influence by rival parties.  Sources suggested that Sir Vince hoped to emulate the success of Justin Trudeau\u0027s Liberal Party in Canada, which introduced the changes and went from third to first place in its 2015 election victory.  A consultation on the proposed changes is expected to last several months.  The party currently has 12 MPs four of whom are Scots: Ms Swinson Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael, the former Scottish Secretary in the Lib-Con Coalition Christine Jardine, who represents Edinburgh West and Jamie Stone, who is MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.  Some UK parties have had leaders who have not been at Westminster. The highest profile is Nicola Sturgeon, the current SNP leader and First Minister. Natalie Bennett, who was not an MP, led the Green Party between 2012 and 2016.

It comes after opposition parties called for the SNP to suspend Mr Salmond over the allegations, which he denies.  Ms Sturgeon said: \"As SNP leader, it is important that I set out the reasons for the party\u0027s current position as clearly as I can.  \"The SNP, like all organisations, must act in accordance with due process.  \"In this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.\"  She added: \"Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish Government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party - and rightly it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.  \"In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond\u0027s membership.  \"Of course, should that situation change, the matter will be reconsidered, as it would be for any member.  \"The party\u0027s rules apply to all members and no one is above them.\"  The claims about Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct towards two staff members in 2013 - while he was in office - have been handed to Police Scotland.  Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the complaints were raised in January and Mr Salmond was notified in March about an investigation.  She intended to make a statement regarding the complaints but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings."},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog told to pay sacked worker 12k","story":"        A former employee of Ellon-based brewers, BrewDog, has won his employment tribunal case after being sacked because he was losing his eyesight!

The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Sunday 26 Aug 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Sunday 26 Aug 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald (vice-chairman), Catherine Patterson (secretary) and Garance Warburton (treasurer).Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Sunday 26 Aug 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For an entry form, please go to www.rewdt.org. Alternatively, entry forms can be picked up in Trek and Travel and Cycle Orkney in Kirkwall, or entrants can also come along on the day and register before the race.This year’s lap will once again start at the pier and the race will be anti-clockwise around the island, finishing by Trumland House.Another run and walk is set to be held in Westray, with the biannual Bisgeos 12-mile run/walk.The 12-mile run/walk starts from Rapness Terminal at 10am, while a one-mile run and walk will take place from Quoys, Westside from 11am. A three-mile event will set off from Roadsmire, Westside at 11.30am.

She has it all.\"I would definitely say she is the best that I have ever had.\"She has strong flat bones in her legs, the hock is nice and high in her hind legs, her second thigh is nice and short, and she has a good deep body and good long silky hair covering her legs and the back of her hooves.\"And she\u0026rsquos good natured too, they generally are.\"The plant fitter, who works for Macdonald Groundworks, has been breeding his own Clydesdale horses for more than 30 years, following in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, Donald Clarke, who worked on farms with the horses and took a stallion around the area.Mr Johnstone said: \"We also have Ord Tinkerbell\u0026rsquos full sister Ord Destiny and her mother Ord Envy.\"We keep them on a bit of rented ground.

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff.

He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider variety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs.

Mr Russell said he detected “stronger sympathy” for the cause among EU nations as the former president of the European Council warned a no-deal Brexit could lead to the break-up of the UK.            Herman Van Rompuy told the Observer newspaper that leaving the EU without a deal posed an “existential threat” to the UK, with consequences for Scotland.            UK ministers have published a series of technical notices advising businesses and the public on how to prepare for a no-deal scenario, although they have stressed that coming to a deal with European negotiators remains their top priority.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously said she will provide an update on plans for a second independence referendum in autumn, and has said leaving the UK without an agreement would be an “unmitigated disaster”.Read more: No-deal Brexit ‘could lead to break up of UK’Mr Van Rompuy told the Observer: “The no-deal issue is not just a problem for the UK or Brussels.“It is also an existential threat to the UK itself. One can imagine that a no deal will have a big impact and cause concern in some of the regions.            “Speaking of Scotland, it could have consequences for them and others.”Appearing at an Edinburgh Festival fringe event, Mr Russell suggested EU leaders’ stance on an independent Scotland has softened.Scotland’s membership status within the bloc was a key area of debate during the 2014 referendum.Mr Russell said: “I do think that if this process is undertaken constitutionally and correctly then it will be accepted by all member states.            “But it has to be done constitutionally and correctly, and that’s what we will do.“I do detect throughout the EU a much stronger sympathy. I do think that the scepticism of 2014 has gone away.”Asked about the timing of a second referendum, Mr Russell said “he did not accept the premise” that the UK Government would not grant a Section 30 Order - the mechanism through which the 2014 ballot was held.“I think that is something which is still a possibility,” he said.He continued: “When we get to the stage where it’s Brexit or independence, people will have to be asked that question. I don’t know when that will be but I do think that will have to happen.            “As to how that happens I think that’s a matter we will have to work on in the next two to three years.”Mr Russell went on to clarify: “I’m not setting a two or three year timetable.“I think we are now in a position where we have to look at this almost of a daily basis, certainly on a rolling basis. So I’m not setting a two or three year timetable, nor am I setting a one year timetable.”Speaking at a briefing last week, the Prime Minister’s deputy David Lidington said the future of the union will not be jeopardised by a no-deal Brexit.“I think that the merits of the union of the United Kingdom are still there and are still very powerful and persuasive regardless of the outcome to the European negotiations,” he said.Read more: What would a ‘no deal’ Brexit look like?"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4788466.1535013953!/image/image.jpg","title":"meter group sms secures tie up with energy firm","story":"        A Glasgow-based metering services firm has signed an exclusive agreement to supply smart meters to a green energy company, as part of a government-led rollout.                Smart Metering Systems (SMS), which connects, owns, operates and maintains energy metering assets and databases, has inked the tie-up with renewable energy supplier Good Energy.            Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers. He said: “We are pleased to announce our partnership with SMS as the chosen supplier of our new SMETS 2 meters, as part of the UK government programme to roll out smart meters to UK energy customers.“Good Energy is focused on making sure smart meters work for the renewable energy sector. “Partnering with SMS gives us the ability to provide our customers with a market-leading smart meter, and associated products, which will enhance user experience.”            This is the latest deal for SMS, which signed a meter rental agreement in February with Utilita Energy to provide more than 100,000 meters throughout the year.The firm in March upped its dividend by more than a quarter despite a dip in pre-tax profits.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

But fate is a fickle mistress and so late on Thursday it emerged her friend and mentor, Alex Salmond, was at the centre of two allegations of sexual harassment/assault examined by civil servants operating under the new rules on complaints against ex-ministers. These allegations had been passed on to the police.            The following morning, Sturgeon faced the unenviable prospect of publicly responding to a situation which has the potential to rip the SNP apart. The pressure must have been immense. Sturgeon’s friendship with Salmond is close and long-standing they stood side by side throughout the referendum campaign, although the relationship appears to have frayed over the past year.             With a survey suggesting one in five people in Holyrood have experienced sexual harassment or sexist behaviour, however, it was crucial the First Minister put the rights of the women to have their complaints rigorously investigated above personal loyalty. As someone who has trumpeted her support for gender equality in the workplace near the top of her agenda, anything short of an explicit endorsement of permanent secretary Leslie Evans’ actions would have been judged as hypocrisy.In the event, Sturgeon, though clearly perturbed, rose to the occasion. “I have been clear... that all organisations and workplaces must make it possible for people to come forward to report concerns and have confidence that they will be treated seriously,” she said. “For that principle to mean anything it cannot be applied selectively. It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved.”Her determination not to waver in the face of Salmond’s anger and the spectre of a court case was significant for several reasons. Earlier in the week, the revelation that actor Asia Argento, one of the first women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of assault, was alleged to have slept with an underage boy, prompted a mini backlash against #MeToo. With some critics exploiting Argento’s behaviour to undermine the campaign, it was good to hear a political leader reassert the importance of creating a culture of accountability. The application of the updated procedure, with the claims investigated by the civil service and not the party, and Sturgeon keeping herself at a distance, also marked a step change from the chaos that characterised the investigation into former childcare and early years minister, Mark McDonald, less than a year ago. The circus that surrounded his return to Holyrood as an independent, during which women at the centre of the investigation were effectively erased, created a climate unconducive to future reporting the way these allegations have been handled may start to repair the damage.            Not that everyone was so keen on the new approach. Salmond, who vociferously denies the allegations, initially tried to gag Evans as she prepared to make them public. He dropped those proceedings, but is now seeking a judicial review over the handling of the complaints. He argues the procedures should not have been applied retrospectively (he had been out of office for three years by the time they were made) and that the investigation itself was carried out unfairly.Salmond is, of course, as entitled as everyone else to the presumption of innocence, but his attempts to put obstacles in the way of due process is not a good look for any politician who wants to be seen as an ally to women. Nor is the frankly bizarre suggestion that resolving the matter by conciliation, mediation or legal arbitration would have been in “everybody’s best interests, particularly those of the two complainants”. Does Salmond really believe these women are incapable of judging such matters for themselves?Outside Holyrood, there were fringe elements on both sides of the divide whose respect for due process was lacking. Some Unionists revisited the old Solero ice lolly photograph and hinted that he always seemed the type. Some Yessers insisted the allegations were part of a vast conspiracy cooked up to discredit the party and the independence movement.Particularly worrying was the denunciation of the complainers as false accusers, with some on Facebook going so far as to suggest, again without producing any evidence, that one of them had been involved in the setting up of the new procedures.            Such behaviour lends weight to the belief, prominent among feminists, that parts of the Yes movement are infected with a misogyny that is swept under the carpet in the pursuit of independence. We recently witnessed the invective unleashed on SNP councillor Rhiannon Spear after she asked why all three speakers at a “BBC bias” protest were men. Imagine what the women at the centre of this investigation would have to endure if their identities came into the public domain. This is especially pertinent when you consider some of the unedifying coverage yesterday. Phrases such as “sex pest” and “boozy bedroom encounter” trivialised the claims while the focus on what all this meant for Salmond was retrogressive.What Sturgeon has done is to distance herself and the SNP from the impulse to put party unity and independence above all else, and to stress the gravity of the situation. This is not to say she doesn’t have questions to answer. The most obvious is the one Scottish Labour has been asking: why hasn’t Salmond been suspended from the SNP just as McDonald was after his accusers came forward? In an interview with the BBC, Sturgeon implied it was because this investigation was not carried out by the party and so the party was not yet privy to its findings. But if there is enough substance to merit a report to the police, then it’s difficult to see why Salmond’s treatment should differ substantially from McDonald’s.More questions will follow if the judicial review finds the investigation was improperly conducted, although it is difficult to see how this would impact on the criminal inquiry which has already been set in motion and will surely now run its course.Life will get even tougher if it turns out the First Minister was aware of any other claims of inappropriate behaviour involving Salmond before he informed her of these ones. But, as playwright and director David Greig said, how we respond to this situation will define our political culture for the future whether or not there is independence.             “No more throwing women under the bus for Indy, for socialism, for art or any other supposed higher goal,” he tweeted.Sturgeon has set the right tone. For the moment, at least, she is leading by example."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789811.1535224996!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm call out the nats for brexit double standard","story":"        Consumed by the certainty of the zealot, former first minister Alex Salmond spent much of the 2014 independence referendum campaign loudly denouncing anyone who dared suggest that breaking up the United Kingdom might come at a cost to Scotland as a scaremonger.                The very idea that a Yes vote would be anything but the key to unlock the gate preventing access to a land of milk and honey was all part of Project Fear in fact, went the Salmond spiel, a No vote would be catastrophic. Only independence could save the country.            In the end, a majority of Scots refused to be “charmed” by Salmond, who became increasingly ratty as polling day approached and has spent much of the past four years refighting old battles with those – Treasury officials, the BBC, anyone who ever looked at him funny – he blames for his failure to lead Yes to victory.            The truth is that Salmond lost, fair and square. His campaign was full of enticing promises but bereft of detail. The former first minister failed to persuade Scots that leaping into the dark with him was worth the risk because he couldn’t provide plausible answers to the most basic questions on currency and the economy.The Salmond mantra – proudly repeated by his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, and other senior SNP figures – was that the best people to make decisions affecting Scotland were people living in Scotland. Only by unlocking this power, could the country truly thrive.Two years after Salmond failed to persuade Scots to take back control, Ukip’s Nigel Farage used an almost identical approach to help win victory for the Leave campaign in the EU referendum. At times, a note-for-note cover version of Salmond’s indy song, Farage’s argument – that the best people to make decisions affecting the UK were people living in the UK – was a success.So why do we continue to put up with the myth that supporters of Scottish independence and supporters of leaving the EU are fundamentally different?Scottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell last week warned that Scotland faced a “nightmare” if the UK government failed to strike a deal with the EU the damage to business, services and the economy would be disastrous.            And it’s entirely likely – since 62 per cent of Scots wished the UK to remain in the EU – that he will have enjoyed the support of many of those listening.In the absence of anything vaguely resembling opposition from the Labour Party, the SNP has filled the void where an anti-Brexit party should be.But that doesn’t make the nationalists’ case any more coherent.If it is reckless to break up a partnership with the EU, with all of the implications that move has for trade and the economy, why is it not reckless to break up a partnership with England, with which Scotland does most of its business?            And how on earth can anyone take seriously the SNP’s claim that only independence can “save” Scotland from the pain of Brexit?The former SNP MP, Jim Sillars, is that rarest of beasts – a pro-independence Eurosceptic. His position involves the unfashionable application of logic: if Scotland should be a “sovereign nation” then breaking all unions – not just the one with the English (or the Westminsters as we are now obliged to call them) – is necessary.Sillars’ position makes sense. It may not be appealing to those who believe in partnerships but it is intellectually coherent.This is much more than can be said for the position advanced by Sturgeon, Russell and others on the SNP front bench.As Brexit looms, the Scottish nationalists will ratchet up the message that a second independence referendum is necessary. They will insist that Scotland can escape the Brexit “nightmare” if only the people choose to break up the UK.            We should treat these claims with the utmost scepticism.How, exactly, would entering into another break-up ameliorate the damage caused by this one? Surely, the risk of a Yes vote any time soon is that a bad situation is made worse.Even Russell, not a man in possession of one of the finer minds in contemporary politics, must surely know that arguing what Scotland needs now is to be even further isolated is nonsense.Identity politics – so terribly popular right now – allows for people to hold entirely contradictory views at the same time. A Scottish nationalist, certain that theirs is the politics of hope, of unlocking potential, can quite happily believe that it is essential to have a formal union with countries on mainland Europe while it’s equally essential that links with England are broken. Surely the time to stop indulging this sort of nonsense has long passed?By all means, be pro-independence, but don’t try to kid yourself letting power reside in Brussels is somehow different to letting it reside in Westminster.The Leave campaign got away with quite a lot in 2016. They lied and bluffed and cheated their way to victory. In 2014, the Yes campaign – just as full of nonsensical claims, hyperbolic warnings and promises to take back power from the establishment – wasn’t so lucky.It’s been two years since the EU referendum and the SNP has been allowed – thanks to Brexit chaos in both the Conservative and Labour Parties – to proclaim its contradictory positions on independence with few questions asked. But this particular emperor has no clothes. A politician arguing that the uncertainty created by leaving the EU is bad but that the uncertainty created by leaving the UK would represent an opportunity is guilty of placing ideology above reason.The UK’s departure from the EU is to be hugely regretted. It will, I fear, be proved an act of national self-harm.Responding to the instability created by Brexit by arguing for the break-up of the UK – with all of the uncertainties such a decision would create – simply doesn’t make sense and we should stop pretending that it does."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789888.1535231211!/image/image.jpg","title":"fresh calls for sturgeon to suspend salmond over allegations","story":"        The SNP is under renewed pressure to suspend Alex Salmond from the party after details of the accusations against him were leaked to the media.                Salmond denies any wrongdoing. The former First Minister has been accused of inappropriate behaviour in December 2013 by two Scottish government employees.            READ MORE: Woman alleges Alex Salmond touched her breasts and bottomIn one of the allegations reported to the government, one woman is said to have repeatedly asked  Salmond to stop touching her in an encounter in the bedroom at the First Minister’s official Edinburgh residence, Bute House.            The woman has alleged multiple instances of unwanted sexual attention during Salmond’s time in office, according to the Daily Record, which claims to have seen wording from her complaint.She alleges that following an official engagement in December 2013 where the First Minister had been drinking alcohol, the pair found themselves alone.She claims Salmond instructed her to move from a public area to the bedroom, and repeatedly offered her alcohol, despite her refusals.He then told her to get on the bed before lying on top of her, kissing her and touching her breasts and bottom through her clothes, according to the report in the Daily Record.An investigation into the two allegations by the Scottish Government permanent secretary Leslie Evans has concluded, and details have been passed to Police Scotland.             Salmond is mounting a legal challenge against the government’s handling of the complaints, claiming its procedures are “unjust”.A fresh statement from Salmond issued yesterday said: “As Mr Salmond made very clear yesterday when he spoke to all media outlets, he intends to make no further comment on these matters until his petition for judicial review is heard in the Court of Session.“This is done on legal advice and in the context that he refutes these complaints of impropriety and absolutely denies any suggestion of criminality.”Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said Sturgeon should suspend Salmond from the SNP immediately.            “Not to do so will send the wrong message to members in her party and the people of Scotland,” she said.“People who experience harassment should be able to come forward in the knowledge there is a safe environment to do so and that the workplace they are in treats their complaint robustly.“The SNP must do all it can to give complainants the support they need whoever the alleged perpetrator is and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward.“The First Minister has been too slow to act on these shocking allegations. “Nicola Sturgeon must take action and she must do it now.”            Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said: “We must respect the women who complained and allow due and fair process to continue so that the facts can be brought out.“However, these revelations do raise questions about the way this matter was treated when it is alleged to have taken place, and these also need to be answered.She added: “We need to see full transparency from the SNP and the Scottish Government.”Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the two complaints were raised in January and Salmond was notified in March about an investigation. She intended to make a statement regarding the complaints this week but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings.Sturgeon said she first heard about the investigation from Salmond in April and had no role in the complaints process.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “For legal reasons, the Scottish Government cannot comment on the nature of the complaints.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789979.1535297843!/image/image.jpg","title":"salmond won t be suspended by snp says sturgeon","story":"        Alex Salmond will not be suspended by the SNP over sexual harassment claims hanging over the ex-First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon has said.                Labour has been calling for Mr Salmond\u0027s membership of the party he led for more than a decade to be suspended while he pursues a judicial review into the way his case was handled by the Scottish Government. It came after two Scottish Government staff members accused Mr Salmond of harassment while he was First Minister in 2013. Mr Salmond denies the claims.

The difference here would appear to be that the SNP had conducted that probe, while this investigation was done by the Scottish Government.But Ms Sturgeon also mounted a strong defence of the Scottish Government\u0027s top civil servant Leslie Evans who has come under fire for the process which was carried out during the probe into Salmond and which is now being challenged by the ex-First Minister at the Court of Session. Ms Sturgeon\u0027s own former special advisor Noel Dolan has said Ms Evans should quit if the Government loses the court case.             The Scottish Government is \"extremely restricted\", the First Minister added, in what it is able to say about \"inaccuracies in the public statements of others.\"She added:  \"That is frustrating but it is inescapable at this stage. In the fullness of time, the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.\"However, we should not allow a focus on process to obscure this central fact - complaints were made by two individuals that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet. It is essential that organisations have processes in place to enable investigation of such complaints and, although I have no role in it, the procedure that has been used to investigate these complaints was agreed by me. The Permanent Secretary was absolutely right to ensure that the procedure was applied in this case and she has my full support in having done so.\"\"The Scottish Government will defend its position vigorously. However, just as importantly, it - and I - will defend the principle that complaints of harassment should always be treated seriously regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person complained about.\""},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSunday 26 Aug 2018 5:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nSunday 26 Aug 2018 5:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

The high level exam results are, in part, the outcome of a longer term development process strategy, where individual pupil profiles are used to provide for a tailored curriculum and a sound work ethic.\n  \nPrincipal, Mrs Lutton, offered congratulations to all the pupils. \n  \nShe attributed their success not only to their own hard work but also to the support of their parents.\n  \n She also expressed thanks to the teaching and non-teaching staff for their ongoing professional commitment and loyalty to the young people of Cambridge House Grammar School.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935996.jpg--.jpg?1534838149000\n","title":"another year of excellence at st louis","story":"  \nST LOUIS Grammar is celebrating outstanding A Level results.\n \n\n  \nAt present, almost 96% of the 170 Upper Sixth students attained three A* to C grades.

The top two achievers were David Byrne and Eimear Smyth each with a phenomenal 4A* grades each in Biology, Chemistry, English, Maths and Physics. These superb results have enabled both students to earn places on prestigious courses. David will study Molecular Engineering at Imperial College, London and Eimear will begin Veterinary Science in UCD.\n  \nMany students have secured first choice university places across the United Kingdom, this includes: Lancaster, Strathclyde, Liverpool, Stirling and Hull to name but a few. The excellent qualifications achieved by students have allowed them to embark on exciting and varied undergraduate courses such as Film Studies, Teaching and Computer Science. A number of students will be starting higher national degree apprenticeships, a pathway which has become increasingly popular in recent years.\n  \nPrincipal, Mr Rafferty, commented, “I am delighted by the way this year’s cohort have risen to the challenges of new A Level specifications. It is a credit to our students and teachers that over 51% of A Levels were awarded A*- A grades and over 82% were awarded A* - B grades. With such a large cohort of students studying such a wide range of A Level subjects, these results are simply superb.\n  \n“This year’s results reflect all that our school mantra, ‘Excellence, Empowerment and Endeavour’ stands for. Our school continues to send students on to high demand courses such as Dentistry, Medicine, Law and Veterinary as well as highly sought after positions in the business sector with PwC and Deloitte. \n  \nIt is testament to their families and staff that the Class of 2018 will now go on to make significant contributions to society.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"civil rights movement a landmark in irelands history and i was proud to be part of it currie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had everything they wanted.\" \n\nMr Currie was brought up in Coalisland, an overwhelmingly nationalist town. \n\nHe was elected as a Nationalist MP for East Tyrone from 1964 until 1972, and was one of the founders of the SDLP.\n\nHe moved to the Republic in 1989 and was Fine Gael TD for Dublin West.\n\nIn June 1968 Mr Currie and others occupied a house in Caledon, Co Tyrone, in protest at the discriminatory allocation of houses by the local council. \n\nWhen he saw a 19-year-old girl \"who happened to be a Protestant and a unionist\" and \"worked at a unionist politician\u0027s solicitor\u0027s office\" being allocated a home ahead of 269 others on the waiting list, he said he felt compelled to take action. \n\n\"I just felt it was unfair, unjust, intolerable and something had to be done, and I did it,\" he said. \n\nMr Currie said he made the decision to organise the march after taking part in the protests against the housing situation, hoping the event would be similar to those witnessed in the southern states of the United States. Two months after that march, another civil rights protest ended in violent scenes when police clashed with protesters in Londonderry. \n\nMr Currie said organisers had actually been disappointed with the numbers that turned out for the march, which had been banned, yet he said it has since become one of the catalysts for the entire civil rights movement here. \n\n\"The RUC acted absolutely stupidly and in front of the television cameras, particularly RTE, they ran awry, they ran mad and it was on the television and was seen around the world and that really effectively gave the boost which became the very successful civil rights movement,\" he said. \n\nThe former TD said he regretted the loss of lives during the Troubles that ensued afterwards. \n\n\"It wasn\u0027t inevitable that it would happen,\" he said, insisting non-violence was at the heart of the civil rights movement. It was very unfortunate and was not inevitable. But I wish it hadn\u0027t happened.\"\n\nMr Currie added: \"The civil rights campaign was an extremely successful organisation and it actually changed the whole political scene as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, and of course I don\u0027t regret that.\" \n\nHe criticised the current power-sharing impasse at Stormont. He said it was a \"totally hypocritical situation\" that elected representatives were being paid when the Assembly was not sitting. \n\nVeteran DUP man Nelson McCausland has a very different interpretation of the civil rights movement. \n\nThe former Stormont minister said: \"It may be the anniversary of the first civil rights march but he said it was certainly not their first appearance on the streets in that they had been out in Easter in 1968 against the banning of the republican Easter Rising parade. \n\n\"That in a sense was part of the problem, that right from the start the civil rights movement was so closely aligned with Irish nationalism and republicanism.\" \n\nHe said the movement was \"never going to be a place that was welcoming to unionists\".\n\nHe added: \"The tragedy is that it led on eventually to a situation which broke out into violence that led to more than 3,000 people dead.\" \n\nThe former MLA claimed that there are a lot of inaccuracies when it came to the housing statistics from the time.\n\n\"Much of what was put forward as fact to justify claims of discrimination was actually manipulated,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said there were some examples where there was an \"unbalance\" but he maintained that overall there was a \"fairly reasonable\" spread of council housing going to Catholic and Protestants at the time. \n\n\"It\u0027s not the picture that was portrayed at the time,\" he said.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37245612.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/fatberg1.jpg","title":"massive fatberg pours out of sewer into west belfast street","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it (not even us!) but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes (including flushable), sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland man declan mcmullan receives blessing from pope francis","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

locked-in syndrome after suffering a heart attack at his home in 2012 aged just 19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was declared dead for thirty minutes and his family were told he had no chance of survival.\n\nThe condition has left Declan without speech but he can still communicate with his family through his eyes. \n\nDeclan, now aged 25, had been enjoying a normal night out with friends before returning home and suffering the heart attack which almost claimed his life.\n\nHis hearing hasn\u0027t been impaired and he has full understanding of what is being said to him, but he can\u0027t speak, move, or see and he uses a wheelchair. \n\nHe\u0027s fed through a peg in his stomach and he\u0027s catheterised, but while he is tetraplegic, Declan still has feeling across his body, from head to toe.\n\nDeclan first came to public attention in 2015 when a video of his brother Mark singing \u0027Bring Him Home\u0027 from the musical Les Miserables to him went viral online.\n\nThe Mullan family, who are from the Saintfield area, traveled to Dublin on Saturday for the World Meeting of Families event where Declan received the blessing from Pope Francis.\n\nWatch Declan recieving his blessing below:

Dr Donal McKeown, a laser specialist, read Steven\u0027s story online, and offered his expertise in tattoo removal.\n\nA year on, the results have been well worth the wait.\n\n\"In all my 25 years of removing tattoos, I\u0027ve seen them on every other part of the body but never on the upper eyelids,\" said Dr McKeown, who is based on Belfast\u0027s Antrim Road. \n\n\"I\u0027ve even removed them from the inside of the mouth, but Steven\u0027s case was unique, and quite difficult. I had to proceed very cautiously, with the laser down at low levels.\"\n\nSteven, from Tullycarnet, was in Spain as part of a 15-strong group celebrating his cousin James\u0027s upcoming marriage, when he drunkenly decided to get the €22 (£20) \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo.\n\nA year and a half on, he is thrilled to be finally free of his daft eyelid doodles.\n\n\"The laser was worse pain than the tattoos but it was definitely worth it,\" he said. \n\n\"Dr McKeown is brilliant, spot-on. I thought I\u0027d have these things for life, but he knew exactly what to do. My mother and Tommy\u0027s mother weren\u0027t too impressed when they saw them and I took an awful lot of slagging, but thankfully, that\u0027s all died down now. You\u0027d really have to look closely to see any trace of them.\"\n\nSteven and his stag party pals had been in a Benidorm bar all afternoon when Steven decided to add the \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo to his collection, which includes inking on his backside.\n\n\"When we came out of the bar, they all went for a walk down to the beach and I just ducked out and walked until I found the tattoo parlour,\" he recalled. \"I told them what I wanted and that was that.\n\n\"The fella wanted €60 (£54) for it but I only had €22, so that\u0027s what I gave him. It was probably a good job, because a more expensive tattoo would have been harder to remove.\"\n\nSteven had flown to Benidorm from Belfast for a three-night stay and admitted he \u0027lost count\u0027 of how much he had to drink before going under the needle.\n\nSteven is single, but can now use his brown eyes to woo the girls, instead of scaring them off.\n\n\"I think I\u0027ll have a better chance with them now,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ll not be getting inked again in a hurry, I\u0027ll tell you that.\"\n\nOver the last 18 months, he has undergone more than a dozen laser treatments on a bi-monthly basis, with dramatic results. The tattoo on his left eye is 95% gone the other is 97%, according to Dr McKeown.\n\n\"The laser breaks up the ink into very small particles and the body\u0027s own natural defence system removes it from the body,\" he explained. \"Steven has been a very good patient. \n\n\"I was concerned he\u0027d be prone to swelling and bruising at the start, as we were dealing with very delicate skin, but he tolerated the treatments well.\n\n\"Fortunately, Steven\u0027s tattoo was in a blue-black ink, which is easier to remove than other colours. I once had a patient with spider\u0027s web tattoo all over one side of his face - he was lucky it was done in the same sort of blue-black ink that can be broken down.\"\n\nA former west Belfast GP, Dr McKeown has removed hundreds of tattoos, including paramilitary slogans and insignia, over the last two decades.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37247553.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pope_ireland_010.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts pope visit and local events set to cause disruption","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Francis was given a taste of a very different Ireland to the one his predecessor John Paul II got almost 40 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nIt included Irish dancing, classical music, children’s choirs as well as testimonies given by families from across the globe.\n\nIn turn Ireland welcomed a different pontiff to 1979, with Pope Francis opening his address to the Festival of Families in Dublin by saying “Dia Daoibh” – Irish for good evening.\n\nIn a light-hearted moment during proceedings, Francis consented to a selfie with a teenager from the Travelling community.\n\nCroke Park stadium was packed with an estimated 82,500 people on Saturday night for the event at which Pope Francis was the star, but he was not the only draw as country stars Daniel O’Donnell and Nathan Carter thrilled the crowd with their performances.\n\nPope Francis received an enthusiastic welcome as he arrived in the stadium and then did a lap of the pitch floor in a golf buggy, closely flanked by his security team.\n\nMembers of the audience rose to their feet, and some even stood on their chairs, for a better look as he passed giving smiles and waves.\n\nWhen the Pope took his seat, Cardinal Kevin Farrell offered him the traditional Irish greeting of a thousand welcomes.\n\nThe pontiff smiled as a group of children performed an Irish dance in front of him, and he exchanged a few words with the youngsters before 500 other children from dance schools around Ireland treated him to a performance of Riverdance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stadium was packed with tens of thousands of people (WMOF18/PA)\n\n\n\n\nCo Donegal crooner O’Donnell was next on stage and brought many in the audience to their feet and dancing with a rendition of Let Your Love Flow.\n\nThere were also powerful testimonies from a number of families, including Azeez Al-Kanah who recollected fleeing their home in Iraq after Islamic State invaded the village.\n\nThere were also strong words from Missy Collins of the Pavee Point Traveller group, who told the pontiff of the struggle of the Travellers for recognition and the value her community places on the importance of family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColourful performers entertained the crowds, and the Pope, during the event (WMOF18/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2,000 singers, dancers and performers took part in the festival, which organisers described as a “once-in-a-lifetime theatrical experience”, and it ran an hour over the scheduled finishing time of 8.30pm.\n\nDuring his address, Pope Francis paid tribute to all those who took part.\n\nAnd as he neared the conclusion of the first day of his two-day visit to Ireland, during which he also met President Michael D Higgins and survivors of clerical abuse amid a packed itinerary, he admitted he was tired.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"young traveller overjoyed after securing selfie with pope","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

[]).push({})\n\n\nAlison Nevin, 12, from Swords in Dublin – who was brought along as a representative of the Traveller community to meet Pope Francis during the Festival of Families – saw the golden opportunity for a selfie with the leader of the Catholic Church, and took it.\n\nHer mum, Brigid, told the Press Association it is important that young traveller people have confidence in themselves, and Alison, who has met Pope Francis before, is a good example for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis speaking at Croke Park (WMOF18/Maxwell)\n\n\n\n\nShe said: “It was a lovely experience for us all, we were given two tickets for myself and Alison to attend, but we weren’t expecting to get up that close to him.\n\n“One of the speakers brought Alison up along with her, as a representative of the young Traveller community.\n\n“She was a bit nervous when she was sitting on the bench waiting to meet with him, but she said the nervousness left when she got up.\n\n“She said she had been thinking of asking him for a selfie in her head, and didn’t tell anyone about it, just decided to go for it.\n\n“She’s absolutely over the moon, her Facebook and Instagram were hopping off all over the place.\n\n“We had to turn the phones off last night, they were ringing non-stop, and the picture was shared over and over.\n\n“She starts her first day of secondary school tomorrow, so she’ll be started school famous.”\n\nOne of the biggest cheers in Croke Park on Saturday was for activist Missy Collins talking about Traveller families, their faith and their exclusion in Irish society – with Alison by her side, Ms Collins asked the Pontiff to pray for young Traveller people in Ireland.\n\n\nMissy Collins pleads for Pope Francis to pray for the young of Ireland’s Traveller community \n#PopeInIreland\n \n#WMOF2018\n \npic.twitter/t8Ps1yaJ6F\n\n— Greg Daly (@GregDalyIC) \nAugust 25, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“It’s very important for us to have members of the travelling community represented for young people,” Brigid added.\n\n“With Alison being so young, she’s set a trend for her peers to have confidence in herself and do it.”\n\nThe Croke Park event marked the second time Alison met with Pope Francis.\n\nDue to suffering from a number of medical issues in the past, she and her mother were gifted tickets for a Papal Mass, and travelled to Rome to meet with the Pontiff and present him with a gift, three years ago.\n\nBrigid said: “This is actually her second time meeting the Pope, we travelled to Rome three years ago, where she got a special audience with the Pope as the first Traveller child he met that day.\n\n“Alison was in and out of hospital at the time, and we were given tickets for us to meet with him.\n\n“He came off the podium and met with her, and she was able to give him a gift.\n\n“Alison would be religious in herself, she has very strong belief so to get this experience, she’s just over the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"davis accuses chancellor of trying

year higher by 2033/34 if the UK resorted to World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Sun on Sunday he said that Mr Hammond was being “either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate”, adding: “I know what I think.”\n\n\n\nIt was an attempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal\nDavid Davis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Davis’s intervention came as his successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested some fiscal projections needed to be treated with “a measure of caution”.\n\nWriting in the Sun, Mr Davis, who quit in protest at Theresa May’s Chequers deal, said the Chancellor’s estimates, outlined in a letter to Treasury Committee chairwomen Nicky Morgan, came from a “Treasury that has trouble forecasting deficits even 12 months ahead”.\n\nHe added: “It was an attempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal.\n\n“And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.\n\n“If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of.\n\nBear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilip Hammond warned of the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit in a letter to Nicky Morgan on Thursday (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMr Hammond’s comments emerged hours after Mr Raab had attempted to play down the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit while outlining the impact of such a scenario via a series of technical papers.\n\nMr Hammond on Thursday was accused of launching a “dodgy Project Fear” with his letter.\n\nThe Chancellor said that his initial January analysis on GDP and borrowing was undergoing a “process of refinement” ahead of a parliamentary vote on any deal, noting scenarios which have higher barriers to trade with the EU are expected to have a “more damaging effect” on the economy and public finances.\n\nHe also defended the Government’s preferred approach, which was outlined in a white paper following a Cabinet summit at Chequers, by saying the economic and fiscal impacts of this would be “substantially better” than no deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab said most Brexit economic forecasts ‘have been proved to be wrong’ (Peter Nicholls/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMr Raab risked a Cabinet row with Mr Hammond after questioning the worth of economic forecasts about Brexit.\n\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, the Brexit Secretary said that GDP estimates for 2019 “have been revised up”.\n\nWithout naming Mr Hammond, Mr Raab told the Sunday Times: “I’m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.”\n\nThe newspaper also claimed that the Cabinet will meet to discuss no-deal Brexit preparations over fears that a row between Brexiteers and Remainers was undermining negotiations with Brussels.\n\nMeanwhile, former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy warned that a no-deal Brexit could cause the United Kingdom itself to collapse.\n\nThe ex-Belgian prime minister told the Observer that crashing out without a deal was an “an existential threat to the UK itself”.\n\nHe added: “We could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united.\n\n“This talk about a ‘no deal’ is the kind of nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"no legal basis

[]).push({})\n\n\nShe said her party had not received any complaints about her predecessor’s conduct – nor had it carried out the investigation – but the matter would be reconsidered if the situation changes.\n\nIt comes after opposition parties called for the SNP to suspend Mr Salmond over the allegations, which he denies.\n\nMs Sturgeon said: “As SNP leader, it is important that I set out the reasons for the party’s current position as clearly as I can.\n\n“The SNP, like all organisations, must act in accordance with due process.\n\n“In this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.”\n\n\nPlease see further statement below. \npic.twitter/paf9bnaaiR\n\n— Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) \nAugust 26, 2018\n\n\n\n\nShe added: “Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish Government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party – and rightly it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.\n\n“In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond’s membership.\n\n“Of course, should that situation change, the matter will be reconsidered, as it would be for any member.\n\n“The party’s rules apply to all members and no one is above them.”\n\nThe claims about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013 – while he was in office – have been handed to Police Scotland.\n\nLeslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the complaints were raised in January and Mr Salmond was notified in March about an investigation.\n\nShe intended to make a statement regarding the complaints but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"how popular is your use of emoji","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

John McCain was one of them,” Mr Schumer said.\n\n“Maybe most of all, he was a truth teller – never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former vatican envoy pens accusing letter over disgraced cardinal case","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Catholic Register (@NCRegister) \nAugust 26, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe National Catholic Register and another conservative site, LifeSiteNews, published the letter attributed to Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano on Sunday as the pope was wrapping up a two-day visit to Ireland.\n\nMr Vigano, 77, a conservative whose hardline anti-gay views are well known, also urged the reformist pope to resign over the issue. \n\nHe and the pope have long been on opposite ideological sides, with the pope seen more as a pastor and Mr Vigano more a cultural warrior.\n\nThe Vatican did not immediately comment on the letter or confirm its authenticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis is visiting Ireland (Yui Mok/PA)\n\n\n\n\nIn it, Mr Vigano accused the former Vatican secretaries of state under the previous two popes of having ignored detailed denunciations against McCarrick for years. \n\nHe said Pope Benedict XVI eventually sanctioned McCarrick in 2009 or 2010 to a lifetime of penance and prayer, but that Francis subsequently rehabilitated him.\n\nFrancis accepted McCarrick’s resignation as cardinal last month, after a US church investigation determined that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible.\n\nSince then, another man has come forward saying McCarrick began molesting him starting when he was 11, and several former seminarians have said McCarrick abused and harassed them when they were in seminary. \n\nThe accusations have led to a crisis in confidence in the US hierarchy, because it was apparently an open secret that McCarrick regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.\n\nMr Vigano apparently sought to answer some of those questions. His letter identifies by name the Vatican cardinals and archbishops who were informed about the McCarrick affair, an unthinkable expose for a Vatican diplomat to make. He said documents backing up his version of events are in Vatican archives.\n\nMr Vigano, the Vatican’s ambassador to the US from 2011-2016, said his two immediate predecessors “did not fail” to inform the Holy See about accusations against McCarrick, starting in 2000.\n\nHe said Francis asked him about McCarrick when they met on June 23, 2013, at the Vatican’s Santa Marta hotel where the pope lives, three months after Francis was elected pope.\n\nMr Vigano wrote that he told Francis: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation of Bishops, there is a dossier this thick about him. He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"city derry airport celebrate ryanairs new derry edinburgh route free flight giveaway","story":"\nCity of Derry Airport is offering its customers the chance to win one pair of return Ryanair flights to Edinburgh on their social media channels. \n\nThe lucky winner (and their travel partner) will enjoy an enchanting city break where they can explore the rich culture of the Scottish capital.\n\nTour the famous Castle, visit Edinburgh Dungeon, shop ‘til you drop for Christmas on Princes Street or soak up the fun in the cosy restaurants and bars.

These worksheets encourage children to look for many of the birds that feature in the film out in Brooke Park’s trees and shrubs afterwards.\n\nIn the Fashion and Textile Centre, Léann Herlihy presents an experiential work which explores historic state violence enacted through gynaecological means. The speculum has a dark history of misogyny, political power struggles, and abuse.

The exhibition features a discussion - What’s Patriarchy Doing Here? – on Tues 18 Sept at 7pm which looks at structures of power throughout recent history\n\nFinally, Sion is a lyrical, experimental film that examines the place, history and purpose of Sion Mills. The work, which combines original, aerial and archive footage in a multichannel collage is created as a site-specific audiovisual installation for Sion Stables. It reflects on the unique ideology of the village that transects an industrial and pastoral past, and seeks to explore the recreational, secular, and environmental aspects that contribute to the fabric of the village and its people. The show is thematically linked to the upcoming exhibition Lavish and Judicious at CCA Derry that explores the history of the utopian model village.\n\nAll four exhibitions will run from Saturday 25\nth\n August to Saturday 22\nnd\n September.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein slammed opportunistic civil rights commemoration set take place derry october","story":"\nA member of the civil rights movement who was involved in the historic march on October 5, 1968, has criticised Sinn Féin for organising a commemoration parade to mark its 50th anniversary later this year.\n\nAidan McKinney, who is a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Committee, said the parade organised for October 6, 2018, is ‘opportunistic’ on the part of Sinn Féin and ‘they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history’ of Derry and Northern Ireland.\n\nOn the parades commission website the applicant listed is the ‘Sinn Fein Commemoration Committee’ and the proposed route for marchers will take in Duke Street, Craigavon Bridge, Carlisle Road, Ferryquay Street, the Diamond, Shipquay Street and finish at Guildhall Square.\n\nThe original planned route by the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC) and Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), was planned to end at The Diamond on October 5, 1968. \n\nHowever, the march ended at Duke Street due to a banning order signed by William Craig, Stormont\u0027s Minister for Home Affairs, where peaceful demonstrators were met with unwarranted police brutality, including four Westminster MPs.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, Mr McKinney said he is both ‘fearful’ and ‘highly sceptical’ as to why a ‘single political entity’ would select that date and route. \n\n“However, to be kind or naive, hopefully they feel that what was organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association on those dates, a totally peaceful protest and a willingness to endure state violence, is recognised and commended as the proper and unselfish approach to correcting existing wrongs in Northern Ireland,” he said\n\n“When the combined words ‘Civil Rights’ are used it is generally accepted that all genuine supporters embrace the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \n\n“Its first articles include: The right to equality and freedom from discrimination The right to life, liberty and personal security.\n\n“These humanitarian rights were enshrined for all of us with an expectation that globally such would be implemented as part of our personal and collective social interactions. \n\n“If this is clearly understood and promoted, as part of these planned events, it is to be welcomed. If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244566\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.
