But are the big six now too powerful for regulators to ignore?The coronavirus pandemic has wrought economic disruption on a global scale, but one sector has marched on throughout the chaos: big tech.Amazon also revealed that its founder, Jeff Bezos, is to step down as chief executive. It was a big moment for the company founded in Seattle 26 years ago. But the shares barely stuttered, and few expect the company to, either.The relentless rise of the big six tech firms - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft, now known as the Fangam stocks – powered US markets last year.Results published so far in 2021 show no sign that the gains will let up. Apple in January reported its most profitable quarter ever, and Facebook also said the pandemic had helped it grow.Amazon recorded sales of more than $100bn for the first time in the last quarter of 2020 – allowing  Bezos to sound a positive note as he changed roles to focus on his ambitions in space, his Earth Fund and his ownership of the Washington Post – and Alphabet posted record revenues for the second successive quarter.The eye-catching performance of big tech has prompted increased political scrutiny and the threat of heightened regulation from Washington, especially now that the Democrats have won control of the Senate.There is now a real possibility that President Biden will take on tech companies over issues such as privacy, liability and market dominance. And such is the collective scale of the US tech titans, it will be difficult for them to hide.Apple became the world’s first trillion-dollar company in August 2018 (barring a few state-owned oil companies whose true valuations remain murky). Just over two years later – in the midst of the pandemic in August 2020 – Apple notched up the $2tn (£1.5tn) milestone.The extraordinary size of these companies can be difficult to comprehend. Alphabet’s $162bn of revenues outweighed the size of Hungary’s economy in 2019.Apple’s $67bn earnings before tax from its last financial year would pay for the UK government’s combined spending on defence and transport.Amazon’s army of workers worldwide now numbers 1.2 million and it is rated the third biggest employer in the world, after Walmart and the China Petroleum \u0026amp Chemical Corporation.A late (and perhaps debatable) entrant to the big tech ranks is Tesla. Investors appear to be valuing the US electric car manufacturer more like a tech platform, in the hope it will use its brand and nascent autonomous driving software to dominate transportation in the future.That logic has propelled it into the ranks of the world’s most valuable companies (and has recently made its chief executive, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man). Its shares have rocketed from $86 at the start of 2020 to $845 now, with some investors fearing it is in the throes of an investment bubble.One common complaint about the stock market is that it is disconnected from economic reality, with booming growth in share prices even as economies suffer historic recessions.The flip side is the argument that these companies are more connected to our new reality than ever before: in fact, between them the big tech companies are involved in a huge proportion of human interactions with digital tech every day, from mobile phones for locked down families to the computers used in businesses all over the world.The electric car technology pioneered by Tesla will play a key role in fighting the climate crisis – and investors have belatedly got on board.But big tech’s fate has become disconnected from the rest of the corporate world. As Jeremy Grantham, a high-profile investor, pointed out last month, Tesla’s stock market value is equal to about $1.25m for every car it sells over a year. At rival carmaker General Motors, the company is valued at $9,000 per car.Tech’s rise has meant the concentration of market value in the five biggest companies has returned to levels last seen in the early 1970s.Back then the stock market was dominated by the old industrial economy: photographic film company Eastman Kodak, ExxonMobil predecessor Standard Oil, and General Motors were in the top five, along with IBM and AT\u0026ampT. Big tech has completely displaced older industries in the top five.The rise of big tech has created the biggest personal fortunes ever seen, and a new class of hyper-rich: the centibillionaires. Almost all of that wealth comes from shares retained by founders of the business.During the pandemic that wealth has increased at a phenomenal rate: in 2020 both Bezos and Musk gained more than $100bn apiece – or about $3,000 per second.But there are other beneficiaries. Among the biggest shareholders in all of them are Wall Street and City investment companies such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Legal \u0026amp General. While those asset managers earn juicy fees by charging clients such as pension funds a percentage of stock market gains from the growth of big tech, their growth also benefits the ultimate owners – including the pension funds providing for hundreds of millions of people saving for retirement.UK fund manager Baillie Gifford’s investments in Tesla have made an extraordinary $29bn (£21bn) for investors including pension funds, foundations and charities, according to figures released to the . Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which is managed by Baillie Gifford, began buying Tesla heavily in 2013 when the shares were changing hands at about $6 each, compared with today’s $840. That soaring share price led Scottish Mortgage to be admitted into the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s biggest listed companies in 2017 and last year the price rise made Scottish Mortgage the best-performing company in the FTSE 100.With size comes power. A simple change in an algorithm can wipe out smaller companies reliant on tech companies’ platforms or even nascent industries. Changes to Facebook’s algorithm in 2018 hit some viral publishers’ revenues hard, while the complexities of negotiating Amazon’s search rankings have spawned an advisory industry.And the companies have also sought increasingly to influence politics. Google overtook Goldman Sachs as the biggest spender on political donations for the first time in 2014. The six tech companies’ total spend on lobbying in the US had risen to $64m in 2019, according to the US Center for Responsive Politics. While that amount is tiny compared with the companies’ profits, its rapid rise represents big tech’s increasing attempts to influence policy directly.Big tech’s increasing size gives it another big advantage: the bigger it becomes, the harder it is to challenge.This has always been a problem with dominant companies, who are able to use their scale to win better deals and lower prices. But with the tech platforms such as social networks or Amazon’s retail network, the more users they have, the faster their value grows. It is what economists call the network effect.Some of the big tech companies have been able to avoid any major competition enquiries in part because they offer consumers cheaper services than ever before. However, there is increasing scrutiny of monopolistic practices.One area of focus has been their willingness to pay what seemed like very high prices for fast-growing competitors.Emails unearthed by US Congress showed that Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook should buy Instagram in part to neutralise its threat. Facebook has – contravening previous pledges – started to slowly combine Instagram’s messaging technology with its other social network, Whatsapp.Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny in the US over its dominance of internet search, which the EU in 2017 found it had abused by boosting results for its own services.One controversy is common to all of the US tech companies (although by no means confined to them): tax avoidance techniques that critics see as aggressive and unfair to smaller competitors.All of the big tech companies use subsidiaries in low-tax countries such as Luxembourg, Bermuda and Ireland to sell services to end markets such as the UK. Fair Tax Mark, a non-governmental organisation, last year singled out Amazon in particular for its opaque tax structures and low amounts of tax paid relative to profits.Globally, Fair Tax Mark calculated, the six big tech companies had paid $100bn less cash in taxes over a decade than they had provided for in their accounts, primarily by shifting profits to tax havens and using creative accounting techniques that are legal, but are usually unavailable to smaller companies.The companies paid $155bn less than might be expected under headline tax rates – money that could have been used to fund public services and infrastructure around the world.Complex legal structures make it impossible to work out precisely how much profit the big tech companies shift out of inidual countries, but Tax Watch UK, a campaign group, estimated that Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, as well as network tech company Cisco, avoided £5bn in UK corporation tax between 2012 and 2017.None of the companies have confirmed such data, although all have said their tax structures follow the law.World leaders are acutely aware of tax issues in particular, and there has been some progress on moving towards a global tax regime to reduce profit shifting from country to country. The US government has up until now looked askance at efforts coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to allow other countries to tax American tech champions more. However, a Biden administration may make a limited deal more likely.Inidual countries have tried to target big tech, including the UK with its digital services tax. But Amazon’s revelation that it will not itself pay the levy – but will pass it on to other sellers which use its platform – shows how difficult it is for one country to strike out on its own.The most likely challenges to the big tech companies are likely to come from policymakers in their two biggest markets: the US and the EU.The EU has won some notable victories against the tech companies, but has also some painful defeats – such as a court ruling last year that Apple did not have to pay a €13bn (£11.4bn) Irish tax bill. More onerous regulations in the second biggest market could be costly for tech companies.In the US, businesses have been forcibly broken up in the past. Most famously, in 1911, the Sherman Act of 1890 was used to force Standard Oil to split into 34 separate companies. It was used again to force the breakup of the AT\u0026ampT telephone company in 1984 and against Microsoft in 1998, though an order to split that company into two was later overturned on appeal.More recently in the US Congress a committee report found big tech has “too much power”, and Google and Facebook face significant if limited antitrust actions by US regulators and prosecutors. In October last year, the US Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Google and said it was “again enforcing the Sherman Act to restore the role of competition”.However, these complex cases could last years, and it is likely that the authorities would settle for remedies short of a complete breakup.There is growing consensus on both sides of the bitter political ide that some of the big tech companies need more oversight, although finding consensus on solutions will be much more difficult.Kamala Harris, then a US senator, said in 2019 that there needed to be more regulation. Whether that attitude is picked up by Joe Biden’s White House now Harris is the vice-president is the biggest question facing big tech over the next four years.Graphics by Glenn Swann, Paul Scruton, Finbarr Sheehy and Cath Levett"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d40b7423ac715840d1be5469d199eecfae2f2d/0_142_4588_2753/master/4588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901e40645d922d8e2433c78dc79e1679","title":"britons drama keir starmer labour leader competence","story":"The lawyerly Labour leader may think the public want calm and competence, but has he met them lately?Like all desperate thrill-seekers in this interminable lockdown, I was momentarily stirred to hear there were some handbags between Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer in one of parliament’s corridors after prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. Yes! Action! I briefly imagined the lightning exchange of cash bets as watching MPs behaved much like the hyped-up midnight crowd in one of those underground Chinese insect-fighting contests.According to some reports, the Labour leader was “puce” and “rattled” when he confronted Johnson for accusing him of having called for the UK not to leave the European Medicines Agency. Alas, subsequent accounts featured a Labour MP denying he had had to hold Starmer back – and in any case by that stage the Labour leader had formally apologised for wrongly thinking that Johnson had claimed he had wanted to join the EU vaccine programme.Ah well. I guess it’s fitting that the Labour leader has finally mildly lost his rag in a misunderstanding over the European Medicines Agency and the EU’s vaccine programme. And no doubt he ran the full gamut of emotions from shirty to tetchy. Unfortunately, the fact Starmer had to apologise for having been the one in the muddle guarantees he won’t take such a sensationally daring risk ever again.All of which brings us to the question: where is the British public at with Keir Starmer? Speaking for myself, I would say that I definitely get he can give sober and detailed university lectures in archaeology. But what most of the movie needs to be, if enough people are going to watch it, is him successfully outrunning a massive boulder hurtling down the tunnel after him. Can he outrun a boulder?As always in the Labour party, any leading man – it’s always a man – has to deal with a lot of poison darts being blown at them by their own side. Thus this week there has been much ranting that Starmer’s Labour is planning to do one of those many political phrases I never understand, and “wrap itself in the flag”. I’d rather it attached itself to some jump leads, but there you go.That said, not hating your country isn’t the category-five alarm bell that Jeremy Corbyn’s OnlyFans subscribers seem to think it is. There are a lot of those people still trying to style out the fact that following an actual nerve agent attack on British soil their absolute boy literally suggested sending Russia a sample of the aforementioned chemical weapon “so that they can say categorically one way or the other”. That was one of the moments at which the 2019 electoral bed was shat, and the inability of some to even discuss it, let alone have a serious WTF-laden laugh at it, is one of the reasons they have to fantasise the red wall was lost because of whimsical  columns like this one. (I heard they talked of nothing else but my Boris Johnson insults on the doorstep.)Whether Labour’s so-called flag-and-family strategy will work, or even happen, remains to be seen. Either way, Starmer has a tendency to feel like the embodiment of the famously passionless, lawyerly answer Michael Dukakis gave in a 1988 US presidential debate when asked if he’d support the death penalty if his wife Kitty were raped and murdered. Though everyone knew he was against the death penalty, Dukakis’s response was immediately held to be so emotionless as to have finished his campaign there and then. I keep wondering if Starmer comes across as another version of that answer.After all, if the past few years have taught us anything … wait, if the past few decades have taught us anything … come to that, if a simple trip on the Friday night bus has taught us anything, it is this: Britain is a majority-nutter nation, and we mostly want to elect politicians with something of the nutter to them. Sorry, but that’s the reality.As a voting body, our longest electoral affections have been reserved for the very biggest nutters. Thatcher and Blair: obvious nutters. Fast-forward to the present day, and Johnson. Nutter. The message of the 2016 referendum was the euphoric nutting of David Cameron (non-nutter). In fact, let me go out on a limb here and posit that the reason Jeremy Corbyn – full nutter – did better than expected against useless anti-nutter Theresa May in 2017 was simply because he WAS full nutter, and the electorate was at some level strangely drawn to that. Corbyn was always going to fall short, of course, because he was the wrong kind of nutter. He was not a kindred nutter. As for May, her campaign’s obsession with control, competence and the avoidance of risk was anathema. She parked the bus (sometimes literally, at campaign events held in empty hangars). Nobody wants to watch that. Certainly, not enough did to prevent the result sealing her eventual fate down the line.The worry for Labour is that, in its own way, watching Starmer is just like watching May, or maybe José Mourinho without the eye-gouging. Labour’s shadow cabinet feels like a back six, or even a back eight. In fact, everyone on the pitch always seems to be tracking back. It’s worth bearing in mind that the default preferred metric by which the England football side will always be judged by the fans is: did they play with enough passion? Did they play on even as their head bandage seeped with blood? Do they understand what it “means” to pull on “the shirt”?Given all that, it’s hard to surrender fully to Keir Starmer’s apparent conviction that what the Great British PublicTM are crying out for is calmness and competence, even if that’s what we collectively tell the pollsters. I mean, we tell the doctors we drink 14 units a week.Arguably, then, the riskiest position of all is this conviction that a technocratic dream of adequacy rocks the UK’s electoral boat. It’s certainly pretty to think so. But hand on heart, I suspect that even when the nutter of the day has cocked it up, what the nutter-addicted people are always really crying out for is just another nutter, a different nutter, a new nutter to bathe us in nostalgia for whichever previous nutters we currently yearn for. The dopamine-mainlining era of social media has only turbocharged this. We now demand 20 nutters a news cycle – and get 40.Or, to transpose this one into another arena entirely, have you seen the epic parish council meeting video that went viral this week? No doubt the Handforth parish council’s many factionalisms and furies have still to play out, but I fear I can tell you right now who’s ultimately going to lose the battle over whatever it is they’re fighting about: Jackie Weaver. Why? Because she’s not a nutter. Listen, I don’t make the rules. But it’s a long old road – and in a scientific eight out of 10 cases, the nutters inherit the Earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/384f21288b1ae336421592acf64a9a6c25fb73a7/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=c3c71ad13a04a95a714adcf5ffeb9921","title":"bored of your four walls let me share my pro tip get some wild wallpaper","story":"During lockdown it has been especially cheering to bunker down in my mad floral jungle of a sitting room when outside all is grey and unrelenting gloomChances are you’re quite bored of your home by now. Oh sure, you know how lucky you are, if you have a warm and comfortable place to live when so many don’t. But a person could live in a full-on palace and still, at this point in a generation-defining global pandemic, think, “If I have to spend one more day looking at this cornicing and those enormous wall sconces, I will genuinely hurl myself off the balcony.” So allow me to share the greatest tip of all time for making your home more fun: get some wallpaper.People are very wary of wallpaper, especially the patterned type. I didn’t fully understand this until my partner and I were house-hunting half a decade ago, after we found out I was expecting twins. Off we went to look at family houses and, while the prices were horrific, the houses were, to my mind, even worse. That’s not fair: they were perfectly fine, but there was something about them that sent me spiralling into a low-grade depression. I tried to explain it to the increasingly exasperated estate agents: maybe they were dark? Or they just had a bad vibe? Were the ceilings too low? At last, I understood: every house I looked at was painted all white or – worse! – some weird Farrow \u0026amp Ball-esque muted grey. Literally, every single one, and I assume the people who lived in them thought they looked chic and safely neutral. To me they brought back memories of teenage years spent in a psychiatric unit.“Safely neutral”: has there ever been a more depressing template for a home? “Safely neutral” is timidity, the decorating equivalent of a fear of letting yourself have fun in case people laugh at you, or a refusal to state an opinion in case you get it wrong. How so many people can bear to live like that is beyond my comprehension. I know not everyone is a maximalist, but I find it bewildering that people won’t commit to patterned wallpaper because they worry they’ll get tired of it, yet paint their home in the most boring shades possible. Be your fearless self! Make your stamp! If not on the world, then at least on your walls.By the time we moved into our (entirely white, God help me) house, I was a month away from giving birth to two surprisingly big boys. I could no longer walk, but this in no way broke my stride when it came to sorting out the wallpaper. This was a home I hoped to live in for the next two decades, so I went all out and spent so much on wallpaper that we couldn’t really afford furniture for a while.But our walls were fabulous. I filled the downstairs loo with zebras, copying the bathroom of a fancy Manhattan restaurant I once did an interview in (I can’t remember who I interviewed, but I sure as hell remember the bathroom). I covered my cupboard of a study with a wildly oversized palm print wallpaper, in the hope of making it feel like a bungalow at the Beverly Hills hotel. It doesn’t: it looks more like a scene from Little Shop Of Horrors, but I’m good with that, too. I got flamingos for my bedroom, and preppy green and white stripes for the hall, for a (in my head, at least) CZ Guest photographed by Slim Aarons vibe. When chinoiserie wallpaper proved too expensive, I found a brilliant woman on Instagram who painted a copy right on to the plaster, turning the sitting room into a scene straight out of Tintin’s The Blue Lotus.I used to think of my wallpapers as my own private pleasure, because only the chosen few entered my patterned palace. Now, thanks to Zoom, everyone I interview sees them, and every conversation begins with a question about my walls, them sitting against their boring white background and carefully curated bookshelf, me against my insane plant print. At first there’s shock – “Er, wow. You don’t see much wallpaper these days!” I know – and then, eventually, envy, as there should be. I haven’t travelled anywhere for almost a year, but every time I walk into a room I travel to a new land. Honestly, it’s better than Netflix. Get some wallpaper. • Hadley Freeman and Tim Dowling will be in conversation on 25 February at 8pm.

Photographer Nina Raingold asked year 3 and 4 pupils across the country to share their views and passionsAt the end of March last year, photographer and picture editor Nina Raingold, faced with home schooling her seven- and three-year-olds, came up with an idea. Inspired by a training course she had taken with PhotoVoice, a charity that believes “participatory” photography can inspire social change, she persuaded her daughter’s schoolmates to pick up a camera (or a parent’s phone) and document their lives. “I thought it might help them deal with their anxiety and sudden isolation from one another. It was never about getting beautiful pictures it was more about the process.”Each family was set a weekly task, with a different theme – such as “rainbows”, “ups and downs”, “something round” – and the children were asked to edit their own photographs. “I wanted to see what was meaningful to them,” Raingold says. The results were observant, funny, even moving: sun-drenched gardens and blue skies a reminder of those hot spring months.When schools closed again in January, Raingold revisited the project, adding three more schools, in urban and rural settings. She asked the children: what does school look like to you, now? They each sent in a single image, with a handwritten caption – a selection of which appear on these pages.What they chose to photograph reveals what’s important to these seven-, eight- and nine-year-olds, as they navigate yet another lockdown: mainly siblings, cuddly toys and pets. But they also show the rewards of looking closely: frost on a plant, a pot of paintbrushes seen from above, an inflatable globe in the corner of a classroom.“What comes across is that kids have such curiosity about everyday things,” Raingold says. “The photographs are a positive reminder to find joy in our surroundings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c6363751b32603ad277d06e0787bfa5548fd026/0_100_1417_850/master/1417.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5a1d87cb2a1dfee3d1c60bf9a5368aca","title":"digging cards chocolate hs2 activists life euston tunnel","story":"Protesters ‘in the muck together’ since 27 January say they are in good spirits as they resist evictionPacks of cards and plentiful supplies of chocolate are essential parts of the tunnel survival kit, according to the environmental activists living underneath Euston to protest about HS2 – the high-speed rail link that is due to come into the London station.Since the early hours of 27 January, nine activists from the campaign group HS2 Rebellion have been occupying a network of tunnels they and others dug out.During the first few days of the protest some of the group were taking turns at the bottom of the down shaft to communicate by phone with people above ground. Deeper inside the tunnel the phone signal is weak or non-existent. Communication has become more sporadic as HS2’s eviction team has advanced.However, the activists are still managing to get messages out saying they are safe and well, in good spirits and that the tunnel network is so far holding up. HS2 has not commented on operational details of the eviction.Eleven days after the tunnel occupation began, the tunnellers continue to resist attempts to evict them, as they hope to raise the alarm about the climate emergency in general and the destruction of ancient woodland and the erse flora and fauna, which they say the HS2 project is causing.A comprehensive survey of the impact of HS2 on wildlife said the project would destroy or damage irreparably five internationally protected wildlife sites, 693 local wildlife sites, 108 ancient woodlands and 33 legally protected sites of special scientific interest.HS2 disputes this, and says it is delivering an unprecedented programme of tree planting and habitat creation alongside the new railway, with 7m trees and shrubs to be planted between London and Birmingham alone.

It’s quiet, especially compared with the noise of London. I’m not from the city so I’m not used to all the noise. I’m not hungry. I’m eating loads and loads including some posh cheese last night.”The activists planned carefully to ensure food and water supplies were in place in the tunnel before the eviction started, along with books to read and packs of cards. Battery packs to keep phones charged have been essential. Toilet arrangements vary slightly above and below ground. In the tree houses occupants climb higher up the tree with a bucket to urinate and then shout “urine” before tipping out the bucket. Below ground there is an arrangement with bailiffs that they will dispose of urine and faeces.Before contact with the tunnellers became more difficult the  spoke to Dan Hooper, also known as Swampy “We are very happy down here,” he said. “We’ve got a really good crew. We all click quite well. We’re having a lot of chats. We play cards when we’re not busy. There’s lots of solidarity down here. We have been working as a crew on this.“Last night we ate a jar of olives and have plenty of chocolate down here. The temperature is a constant 12 degrees so we’re never cold. I’m feeling quite positive about the whole thing.”He described it as “absolutely outrageous” that what he said was the biggest deforestation since the first world war was happening at the time of the climate emergency. “Government is planning to restart the road-building programme we stopped in the 1990s … It’s just full steam ahead. The only thing that’s going to stop it is that these schemes are so unpopular. Actions like the tunnel protest are turning the tide and making the government aware that people aren’t going to stand for this sort of thing.”Jimbino Vegan, 41, a musician, poet, writer, artist and activist, has experience both above and below ground on the anti-HS2 protest at Euston. He helped dig the tunnel and was one of a group of seven in the first treehouse to be evicted on the afternoon of 27 January after bailiffs moved in.His involvement with working on the tunnel began when he was playing music near Euston at the end of last year. The weather was very cold and he discovered the tunnel was a good place to warm up. He soon got involved with helping with the covert digging project.“I’m surprised nobody knew what we were doing. People kept emerging carrying buckets of earth and covered in muck,” he said. Much of the tunnelling work was done between 4pm and 5am, he said.“The digging work can be a bit lonely, often two people would be working together but it was also very satisfying and there was a fantastic vibe in the camp. It’s been a real education for me. ”There has been concern over the protesters’ safety. Georgia Gould, the leader of Camden council, said: “I believe in the right to peaceful protest, and as leader of the council I have expressed my deep reservations about the impact of HS2 to Camden. I support the right of citizens in our borough to make their voices heard, and to take non-violent action to bring attention to causes they are passionate about.“However, I am deeply concerned about the risk to the health and lives of these protesters in these tunnels – from gas and electricity supplies, from the risk of tunnel collapse and from living underground for prolonged periods. I would urge everyone still at the site in Euston Square Gardens to leave the tunnel, make themselves safe and ensure that their voices continue to be heard in the national discussion about HS2 and the climate and ecological crisis.”Others have criticised the target chosen by the activists. Gareth Dennis, a railway engineer and writer who supports the HS2 project because he believes it will reduce climate damage, said: “My frustration with the activists in Euston Square Gardens is that they are repeating some of the anti-public investment arguments against HS2. They are succeeding in drawing attention away from damaging road projects and drawing attention to a project that stands to make a mass contribution to reducing Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions.”But Vegan said the hope of the activists was that the combined impact of Covid and the climate emergency would help people re-evaluate their place in the world and see what they are doing to destroy their own habitat.“We need to become closer to nature, to learn from it rather than destroy it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b86dd35c9fb01f24b85b02ebcc1f42f1a4914ed/0_0_2933_1955/master/2933.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641046feb53cbcfde6ab9b5a29933a5e 880w","title":"lockdown stress tips covid experts burnout","story":"We are in an uncontrollable environment and we need some sense of control to feel healthy, so give yourself small achievable goals to regain a sense of control.

Encouraging ourselves to go out into the word encourages the prefrontal cortex to work more effectively, which is good for creativity and attention encourages better function.What we are going through now is part of our human experience and we only have the capacity to experience joy because we experience pain. This is the shadow side of so many gorgeous things and anyone who has gone through grief or sexual trauma or health problems will know that sometimes what you are going through is hard and can be long. There is something about being as kind to ourselves as possible and not looking for the quick fix and easy solution, looking for hope – where it is there – and contact. Yes, at the moment it feels unstable and at those moments, some people will adopt conspiracy theories and so forth, but lots of others will be asking big questions about how to live life and what is important. That is such a gift and answers to those questions will serve you well in the future – 2020 promised us clearer vision but never told us we would like what we see.People should be on the lookout for red flags or warning signs that they’re excessively stressed out. These include sleeping difficulties, increases in irritability or moodiness, and overeating or abusing drugs or alcohol. If you notice these warning signs then it’s important to try various forms of stress management. These include reaching out to friends and family and developing a healthy lifestyle – for example, regular sleep, healthy diet and physical exercise. You can also deploy various forms of relaxation exercises such as meditation and yoga. If the forms of self-help aren’t sufficient, then you should consult your family doctor. There are also some very good internet self-help programmes and phone apps available, which can be useful.At the age of 30, I moved to a remote cottage with no services in the hills of mid-Wales and lived there alone with no vehicle and no phone … I began to find this life suited me and I remained there for five years.You might say that I was uniquely suited for the unexpected arrival of lockdown, even though I am a single parent living in a council flat in town, and unable to head out to the wilder parts of the country as I am used to.I have, however, made a point of going out walking every day, and resetting my expectations of what I am likely to experience. I have refocused my attention on to the smaller things – wildflowers and butterflies and fungi, learning as I go. I think that a lot of people have found that a locked-down life has given them a much greater appreciation of the natural world, and I hope that many people will find that this new interest endures. I find myself, and trying to find the positives in any given situation, concentrating less on what I have lost than on what still remains to me and thinking about what I can do today rather than what I can’t.I wrote my first book in my head. I used my imagination to write stories and kept my mind going. The other thing to do is to learn to live for the moment – you cannot think too far ahead. It is easy to become depressed and when you are isolated and faced with yourself there is a tendency to become very introspective – and anyone who is introspective will find they look inside with two sides of their personality, the light and dark. If you dwell too much on the negative side you can fall into a deep depression. The answer to that is to recognise we are all the same, we all have two sides of our character and work for a degree of inner harmony.My life changed greatly after I came out of captivity and I thought time in captivity was a waste of time, but it was not. I was discovering creative abilities I had that I did not know I had.

But following a trading frenzy the stock began to fall, almost as quickly as it had risenAt the beginning of the year, not many people were paying attention to GameStop. Its business of selling video games in retail stores looked increasingly shaky as the market shifted ever more online in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic. GameStop’s seemingly grim prospects led Wall Street hedge funds to take out big bets on the company’s share price falling further (known as short selling) but they had not reckoned with a force that was about to blow them away. Users of the Reddit messageboard WallStreetBets began grouping together to buy huge quantities of GameStop’s stock, driving the share price higher and higher and inflicting huge losses on the hedge fund titans.  Desmund Delaney tells Rachel Humphreys that as part of the Reddit community he was tipping shares in GameStop back in 2019 and took his own advice investing in the company, despite the derision of other users. But he gave up on the company last year while its share price was below $10 and cashed out. If he’d sold last week he would be sitting on half a million dollars.  Economist Dan Davies explains that while the phenomenon of an online community-driven stock market bubble feels new and exciting, it’s a story as old as the markets themselves. A group of investors egg each other on to speculatively jack up the price of shares they are holding – only for the whole thing to come crashing down. In the case of GameStop, it may have burned some incautious hedge fund managers, but the steep decline in the share price this week has proved to be a sharp lesson for amateur investors who didn’t sell up before the crash began. Are online forums a new force on Wall Street? Or are the odds still stacked too steeply against them?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6c87eb448c6e2a1fd73841160abfcafb3d754f/0_0_4001_2399/master/4001.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3c4d1ba9448e109db0d115288210101d","title":"india v england first test day two live","story":"157th over: England 482-6 ( Buttler 6, Bess 1) A teasing over from Ashwin, but Buttler snitches a single to mid-on from the last ball. 156th over: England 481-6 ( Buttler 5, Bess 1) Bess off the mark with an easy single.155th over: England 478-6 ( Buttler 4, Bess 0) Just a squirted single to Buttler, a quick over by Ashwin, England barely a chance to draw breath.154th over: England 478-6 ( Buttler 3) A funky stat for you - this is Buttler’s 50th Test, and Root’s hundred. A fraction that blows my mind. But forget all that - Root goes, after a wonderful , masterly innings, but England need to be very careful here now. Kohli, who shook Root’s hand as he left the field, is a master at these situations. The big one! Nadeem grabs the captain with a ball that straightens, and hits the front pad. Root reviews more in hope than conviction but to no avail. What an innings. Now this is interesting. 153rd over: England 474-5 (Root 217, Buttler 1) Yikes! Buttler, beaten in the flight, inside edges his first ball to mid-wicket where it just falls short of the ing fielder.  “Has anyone ever run the stats to see how many of Roots unconverted 50’s came under Trevor Bayliss’ coaching?” asks Rory Beard. “Basically I think his over aggressive style of coaching cost Root a lot of his conversions - specially when you picture how many times he got out edging a wide ball outside the off stump? Anyway I thought it was interesting. And I would read an article about it if it was true. :).”Rory, I’m going to pass your email on to Rob - he eats those questions for elevenses. Ashwin slides one through and hits Pope on the back pad, and he slumps awkwardly which must encourage the umpire to raise his finger. Pope doesn’t bother to use one of England’s plethora of reviews. 152nd over: England 472-4 (Root 216, Pope 34) And with a dab off Nadeem, Root overtakes Alec Stewart to become England’s third-highest Test run scorer, behind only those Essex boys Gooch and Cook. He’s passed Pietersen, Gower and Stewart in the last three Tests. 151st over: England 469-4 (Root 214, Pope 33)  Pope’s eye seems well and truly in with a charming reverse-paddle for two, before he miscue’s a rank full-toss from Ashwin that surprises everyone, bowler, batsman and Rishant Pant who staggers the wrong way in chase. 150th over: England 465-4 (Root 214, Pope 29) Pope drives at Bumbrah and gets a thick-outside edge that flies through the lonely slip-cordon for four then a clip off his twinkly-toes. Bumrah’s perserveres clockwork doll action imperfectly perfect.Good Morning Tanya,. Hello Sam Charlton!Few things are more wonderful than watching England do so well abroad.Re: the weather and the seasons. Frankly I am distraught, I was hoping for my second walk in as many days since my newly allowed freedom from catching COVID. In Leeds it is biblical at the moment. A nice spring day would be been perfect. Perhaps I am too optimistic for February. I take back my talk of spring. Is now disgusting in Manchester too. Glad to hear you’ve recovered from COVID - don’t overdo it now149th over: England 459-4 (Root 213, Pope 24) It’s the big boy double act as Ashwin rolls in from the other end. A tall man, stocky for a spinner. Pope and Root are watchful on a peach coloured pitch, a gentle wind ruffling Root’s shirt.148th over: England 458-4 (Root 212, Pope 24) Kohli throws the ball to Bumrah for a post-tea blast. His second ball is a no-ball, cue the no-ball siren. Seriously, someone now has a job of watching the crease every ball to check if the bowler oversteps. ICC work-experience? You wouldn’t want to be lumbered with that all year round. Bumrah attempts to get the ball switched, I don’t blame him, the ball seems to have eaten its own seam. Four from the over.A lovely email from Ian Wilson:“Afternoon Tanya, Ian from Side Turkey watching the cricket and following your comments with 20C of sunshine here, just thinking and reminiscing about another time in my cricket watching life back to May and Cowdrey in the 50s and early 60s, with their patience when compiling scores, reminds me of Joe Root the way he is now building his innings with patience, concentration and great skill, for his team not just for his own ego, a truly talented young man setting a great example to his team and all young cricketers.”The players are out for the final session and, as Alastair Cook said when they switched back from the studio, “England have India just where they want them.”Simon Hughes has set up an analyst’s studio in his bedroom - blue walls, a Durham T-shirt and a Middlesex sweater in the background. I think he’s great and I think he was saying some really interesting things about Joe Root but unfortunately I can’t tell you anything as EVERYONE IS TALKING very loudly in the living room and I can’t hear a thing. The drollest email of the year drops by, from William Lane “Are we going to start becoming frustrated at Root’s inability to turn 200s in to 300s? Feels as though if you took the captaincy off him he would be able to break free from the shackles of responsibility and start making some proper runs.”147th over: England 454-4 (Root 209, Pope 24) Rohit serves up a whoopy-doopy full-toss to end the session and a a grinning Joe Root dabs him to long-on. He’s got plenty to grin aboutDavid Hindle writes: “Early days yet, but in a calendar year where England are scheduled to play a record number of tests, after just 2.5 of them, Root has \u0026gt600 runs and counting. He is on course to obliterate the record for test runs in a calendar year. Currently 1788 by Mohammad Yousuf. Root is going way past 2000 at this rate. Where did Joe find this version of himself?”I’ll leave you to ponder that as the players walk off the pitch: 99 runs in the session, one wicket lost, one double-century pocketed. In the shade of England’s dug-out, the players stand to applaud their O Captain! My captain! 146th over: England 451-4 (Root 206, Pope 22) Channel four have now put an arrow next to the facing batsman’s name, which is an improvement on yesterday. England reach 450 - fifty short of Rob’s requirement of 500, 250 short of Joe Root’s dreams of 700. England have scored 96 runs so far this session. A wafty sweep from Root ends the over. 145th over: England 449-4 (Root 206, Pope 22) Rohit Sharma bowling before tea wasn’t in Virat Kohli’s gameplan - I imagine copper-plated handwriting in an immaculately kept notebook. Four from it“I can’t see Spring coming just yet, it’s more like dawn is a slow seepage.” says John Starbuck. “On the other hand, I’m getting my first Covid vaccination this afternoon, so there’s some promise of renewal.”144th over: England 445-4 (Root 204, Pope 20) Nadeem whizzes through another over that Pope and Root milk for five runs.143rd over: England 431-4 (Root 202, Pope 17) Runs beget runs beget runs - as Joe Root leaves those doldrum years in a locked cupboard somewhere in Yorkshire. He has surely earned a recall to THE BIGRoot dances to Ashwin, slices his bat through the air and the ball soars over long-on for six! He takes his helmet off, kisses the badge and raises both hands in the air, the broadest of broad smiles on his face. What an innings! What a man!142nd over: England 431-4 (Root 194, Pope 16) Tip and run by England off Nadeem until a HUGE lbw appeal against Ollie Pope off the last ball, but India have used up all their reviews. And anyway, he got an inside edge“Hi Tanya hope all well”. Hi Danny Fontana!“Went to bed dreaming of two things:1) Joe Root to still be at the crease when I woke up 2) my youngest to not get out of bed til 7.30amI’m no betting man but I guess the odds would have been about 300-1 on both sides of the bet coming good.Although I’m no richer of pocket, I certainly feel richer of soul. What a player! What a daughter!” 140th over: England 424-4 (Root 190, Pope 13) Root reverse-paddles Sundar for four, as if using some kind of elaborate tool in a woodworking studio, as my son shows me a huge lump he’s grown after running into a wall. David Melhuish agrees with Jesse Linklater’s memories of Galle“Indeed, those drone shots of Galle were so very soothing, dreamlike and almost other-worldly. Not been out of this small area (Macau is but 30 sq km) for over 13 months. Counting ...As we absorbed the action, I made mental notes on the second destination (after UK) when this COVID is over. Wistfully imagining soaking up a few days test cricket, short stroll from our rented villa (pool, games room) close to the ground. Checking out the local eateries in the evening ...Yardda yadda, etc and so on .So ,,, yeah. Do miss.”139th over: England 416-4 (Root 184, Pope 11) Pope has a rush of blood, and nearly runs out Root and three balls later, Ashwin appeals for a catch at leg-slip. Kohli reviews with barely a second left on the clock.... the ball seems to have missed the bat... and, yes, the glove... as Pope gets down on one knee to sweep... NOT OUT!138th over: England 415-4 (Root 183, Pope 11) Beautiful from Ollie Pope, a short jab off Sundar that slides past mid-on to kiss the boundary rope. The camera pans to Virat Kohli, he seems pale behind those inscrutable sunglasses.137th over: England 410-4 (Root 182, Pope 7)  Root has had enough of this, slamming Ashwin flat back over his head for four Pope slaps himself into the ground to avoid being hit. Then a dangerously-quick single.136th over: England 404-4 (Root 177, Pope 7) Six beautiful fat dots from Sundar, Pope watchful. India whizzing through these overs with intent. Gary Smith types from Marseille “Morning Tanya, you want murky? Down here in Marseille we have the Sirocco rattling along at around 70 kph, and a very murky, yellowy orange sky due to several zillion microscopic bits of the Sahara Desert being suspended up there....it’s orange car day :-”135th over: England 404-4 (Root 177, Pope 7) The scoring rate has slowed to a crawl since Stokes’ dismissal. But that’s ok. Put the kettle on for me will you?134th over: England 403-4 (Root 177, Pope 6) Ollie Pope tips a reverse-sweep into the covers off young Washington Sundar - a name straight out of Hamilton. Adam Levine, stretches and types: “There must be a portrait of Joe Root in the long room at Lord’s decaying and covered in mould. The weight of expectation early on in his career, the pressures of captaincy, the endless touring, none of it seems to age him or dent his absolutely relentless joy and enthusiasm at playing the game he so obviously adores. What a player. What a captain. What a man. “I agree, he is admirable in almost every way.133rd over: England 401-4 (Root 176, Pope 5) Ashwin resumes, replacing Nadeem, high right arm. Root retreats and calmly defends, before picking up a single off the last ball of the over. So far in 2021, Root has 600 runs and his average in India is now higher than Kohli’s. His career average has also crept back over 50....Thanks Rob! That’s a nice round number to take over with on a murky Saturday morning. And, and.... at 745am it is light enough to see the colour of the house over the road’s front door. Spring really is a-coming. 132nd over: England 400-4 (Root 175, Pope 5) Another single from Root takes England to their new benchmark: it’s the seventh time in 15 Tests under Chris Silverwood that they have reached 400 in the first innings. It’s time for drinks, and for me to hand over to Tanya. You can contact her at tanya.aldred.freelance@the or @tjaldred. Bye!131st over: England 399-4 (Root 174, Pope 5) Pope, beaten in the flight I think, inside-edges Nadeem into the leg side for a single. He comes down the wicket later in the over, but can’t get to the pitch of the ball so settles for a defensive stroke. This is another good contest, with Nadeem looking more confident than against Root and especially Stokes.130th over: England 395-4 (Root 172, Pope 4) Ishant replaces Bumrah, and Root flicks his first ball round the corner for another single. His batting today has been cold and clinical. Pope plays out the rest of the over, mainly by flicking straight deliveries to one of the leg-side fielders.129th over: England 394-4 (Root 171, Pope 4) Pope is beaten again, this time while sweeping inelegantly at Nadeem. It’s a fine line, but at the moment he looks a little too keen to run before he can walk.128th over: England 393-4 (Root 170, Pope 4) This is an important series for Pope, who had a slightly disappointing summer. He’s a class act, so he’ll expect to improve on a Test average of 38. Bumrah beats Pope with a beauty that turns him round and straightens sharply to hit him high on the back leg. Bumrah went up for caught behind but replays showed it missed the outside edge by a fair way. It was a stunning delivery from a consistently brilliant bowler.127th over: England 392-4 (Root 169, Pope 4) Ollie Pope is the new batsman. He gets off the mark with a slightly risky stroke, slicing a cut through the vacant gully area for four. “Is anyone else missing the endless shots of the boats in and around Galle harbour?” asks Jesse Linklater. “I found them very soothing.”I mean, I hadn’t given it that much thought.That was a lively innings from Stokes: 82 from 118 balls, with 10 fours and three sixes.Ben Stokes dies by the sword. He slog-swept Nadeem high towards deep backward square leg, where Pujara muffed a simple catch but was able to trap the ball in his chestbusiness area.126th over: England 387-3 (Root 168, Stokes 82) I think England will bat on until tomorrow if they have the option. Their best chance of winning this game is probably to score so many that they could enforce the follow-on without worrying about being Kolkataed. Bumrah, meanwhile, ends another good over with a sharp short ball that surprises Root. He shaped to pull and then thought better of it.“Hi Rob,” says Ben Stechler. “Englishman living in Melbourne here, feel a bit apologetic having been spoilt with the Aus v India series, and now England turning starts into wins. Watching in the local pub, staying until Root gets out... let’s hope for a long evening! Anyway as much as I hope England win the series, is a subcontinent tour the best preparation for an Australian Ashes series, where pitches are vastly different? Of course Covid has played its part, but I can’t help but think the WI or SA pitches are better for getting used to pace and bounce in Australia. Plus I can’t handle us losing the Ashes over here again!”What’s a ‘local pub’? As for the preparation, they don’t really get to choose as tours are scheduled according to the Future Tours Programme. I’m not sure it matters too much - I’d say the warm-up matches in Australia are far more important.125th over: England 384-3 (Root 168, Stokes 79) England milk Nadeem for six runs in that over thanks to some smart placement and running.In the last two years, Stokes averages 59 from 17 Tests he should soon have a career average of over 40 for the first time since 2013.124th over: England 378-3 (Root 165, Stokes 76) Bumrah replaces Ishant, with India in urgent need of a wicket or seven. He tries a loopy slower yorker to Stokes, who waves it between mid-on and midwicket for four more. The next ball beats Stokes’ attempted pull it was a bit too wide for the shot. 123rd over: England 373-3 (Root 164, Stokes 72) As well as England have played, we shouldn’t get carried away. In the last series in India they scored 537 in the first innings of the first Test, and lost 4-0.Mind you, it’s tempting to lose the run of things when you see Stokes dance down the wicket to lift Nadeem down the ground for another big six. That’s his third of the innings, and he has raced to 72 from 106 balls.122nd over: England 365-3 (Root 163, Stokes 65) There’s a bit of Allan Border in this innings from Root - not the style so much as the mentality, to bat until the cows come home without worrying too much about forcing the tempo. He has scored 35 from 92 balls this morning, including a drive through off for a couple in that over from Ishant. “Hi Rob, from Paris,” says Alisdair Gould. “It is a long road that never turns,” but what a llllloooonnngg road this journey has been. I was 50 on Monday. I would never have guessed as a boy that the West Indies would ever be a weak side, nor that I would be reading ‘over by over’ reports of cricket in India on a tiny screen, or that we would have a captain able to deal with subcontinent spinners on a wicket that has turn. (What a great tie up of the word turn. And how great life is as a cricket pilgrimage.)” 121st over: England 363-3 (Root 161, Stokes 65) Shahbaz Nadeem resumes his contest with Ben Stokes, with a slip and short leg in place. I’m surprised they don’t have a leg gully given how much the ball is spitting from the rough. Stokes misses a premeditated reverse sweep and is hit on the arm then he flicks a short ball into the leg side for a single. That will frustrate Nadeem, who would have wanted a full over at Stokes. And the next ball will irritate him even more: it’s too short and Root forces it through point for four. He is batting delightfully.“Hi Rob,” says Garry Sharp. “In that documentary the Test, there was an imperious, master-of-all-he-surveys character called Virat Kohli. I wonder if we are watching the same person now. He seems different. Although I don’t want to tempt fate, this could all change. Just an observation. Also, do we have a moral obligation to sit through all the ads on C4, as an acknowledgement of the great thing they’ve done for us?”Only if they are soundtracked by Bicep.120th over: England 357-3 (Root 156, Stokes 64) A quiet first over from Ishant, just a leg-bye and a single to Stokes.“Morning Rob,” says Adrian Neville. “Re: David Dowling being on the edge of a continent (over 112), I’m reading in bed from Kinsale, southwest Ireland, also on the edge of a continent. We even have a place at the edge of town called World’s End. (And another called Scilly with a Scilly Walk but that’s not yet relevant.) I’ll get up later and do my exercises in front of Channel 4. Stuff the T’ai Chi lessons for now.”The players are back out on the field, and Ishant Sharma is coming on for Jasprit Bumrah.“Hi Rob,” says Jack McCabe. “As someone who missed 2005 (both a mix of too young, and an Irish family who had no interest in cricket), it’s a pleasure and a privilege to watch Test cricket on free to air TV. “I never had an opportunity to play or watch cricket of any sort till I went to university, where I caught the bug fully. A state comprehensive in the mid-2000s had neither the time or resources to encourage or teach cricket, and the sport became a symbol of privilege and inequality for years before I got a love for it. Accessibility to cricket, and the connotations of what that means, has always fascinated me. It may sound trite and meaningless, but it genuinely means a huge amount for cricket to make a conscious effort to try and attract fans away from its traditional base through this channel 4 deal. Hopefully Mambo No.5 won’t just be an anthem of nostalgia, but a call to increased participation and appreciation across the country. Maybe I’ll even manage to teach my family the rules (we managed to get halfway through the concept the ‘over’ during the recent Windies Test series before interest started to flag).” 119th over: England 355-3 (Root 156, Stokes 63) Sundar bowls an uneventful over to complete a brilliant morning for England, who scored 92 runs from 29.3 overs. They rode their luck a little - Stokes was dropped twice and Root survived a run-out chance - but generally played very well, with Stokes bullying the inexperienced pair of Shahbaz Nadeem and Washington Sundar. See you in 30 minutes for the afternoon session.118th over: England 354-3 (Root 155, Stokes 63) Four more to Stokes, timed through midwicket off Bumrah. This is starting to look slightly ominous for India. If Stokes is still batting at tea, they can forget about winning the game.117th over: England 348-3 (Root 154, Stokes 59) Stokes is really going after the change spinners. He slog-sweeps Sundar for two boundaries in three balls, which takes him to 59 from only 91 balls. At one stage he had 18 from 38.“On the other side of India, I sit in a cafe as the sun lashes the golden Kovalam beach and masala chai with a hearty omelette goes down a treat,” says Guy Perry. “I dream of Root whacking a big six from Chennai for me to reach out and catch. Go, Joe!!!”116th over: England 340-3 (Root 154, Stokes 51) Bumrah replaces Ashwin with just under 15 minutes remaining before lunch. Root works a single off the pads he has happily played second fiddle this morning, hitting only a couple of boundaries to Stokes’s eight. Stokes gets a single later in the over, and then Root digs out another blistering inswinging yorker from Bumrah. Well played.115th over: England 338-3 (Root 153, Stokes 50) The offspinner Washington Sundar replaces Nadeem. His fourth ball kicks nastily at Root, who smiles partly because he’s having the time of his life generally and partly at the thought of what this pitch might do on days four and five.113th over: England 336-3 (Root 151, Stokes 50) Stokes races to fifty with consecutive reverse-sweeps for four off Nadeem. It’s been an increasingly aggressive innings, mainly because of that rough outside his off stump: 73 balls, six fours, two sixes. England are in a fine position now, and should be safe from defeat if they can add another 400.112th over: England 328-3 (Root 151, Stokes 42) Oof, Root survives a big run-out chance after Stokes takes a dodgy single into the leg side. Washington Sundar’s throw was really poor, on the half volley to Pant’s right. Had it been straight into his gloves, never mind a direct hit, Root would have gone.“Reading you on the western edge of Vancouver Island, the western edge of a continent,” says David Dowling. “A link in the thin red leather line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14018f4ac4b52dae4851bddda1352c08f1351c75/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e6f4769c0b198d94a898b85fe05fc758","title":"no touchscreens more space welcome to the post pandemic office","story":"With new safety protocols prompting design changes, traditional office spaces may be a thing of the pastThe pandemic has shown us that work can go on without a workplace. If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?Elvira Muñoz Beraza, director of the master’s in strategic design of spaces at IE School of Architecture and Design, in Madrid, says that this year’s disruptions will transform offices for the better. “The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already there and has forced companies and experts to have difficult yet necessary conversations,” she says. “The office is the place for collaboration, social interaction and a sense of belonging. This implies less ‘me’ spaces and more ‘we’ spaces: the long open areas filled with inidual workstations or filled with cubicles are gone.”With inidual workstations effectively relocated to people’s kitchens and living rooms, offices are being reconfigured as places that primarily exist for teamwork and collaborative activity – albeit with strict social distancing measures in place and partitions separating different teams and departments.Architects and office planners are already busy with a raft of changes, including larger desks and layouts that make more use of stairwells to reduce the use of enclosed lifts. And, of course, there’s the ongoing drive to minimise the use of frequently touched surfaces, such as taps, door handles and buttons.Beraza is focused on how offices can evolve to meet the changing needs of a company and its employees. “I believe the design of the workplace will need to focus on a hybrid combination of physical and virtual, of inidual and collective, of internal and external actions, tasks and collaboration.”She notes the importance of supporting a hybrid form of office and remote work. “Remote working should stay, combined with physical encounters. Remote work is sustainable because it provides more choice and is more inclusive and erse. The nine-to-five office culture is gone for good.”Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s senior manager of workplace services, EMEA, believes that, post-Covid, the distinction between “working from home” and “work” will cease to exist. “For many employees, the traditional office and desktop workspace is over. For them, work is wherever they want or need it to be, on whatever screen and digital device they prefer,” he says. “This agile, more distributed ‘anywhere, anytime’ workplace of the future will transform how companies operate.”Barker believes this flexibility will become an increasingly important factor for attracting and retaining staff. “If businesses don’t look to change, whether that’s with a hybrid model or all the way to completely remote, they will struggle to bring in the talent needed,” he says.Within the office, new technologies are being adopted to enable more rigorous safety protocols. Companies are shifting to touch-free sensor technology for handles, buttons and taps, signalling a reverse from the preponderance of pre-Covid touchscreens. Some planners are even looking at technology that will allow staff to control lifts and vending machines using their personal smartphones.“In terms of the conversations we’ve been having about safety precautions in the future,” says Barker, “it’s about trying to reduce the number of touchpoints employees have, whether that’s automatic doors, coffee machines, access card readers and things like that, to reduce any contamination generally.”Other design changes will need to take place, too. Daaf Serné, ServiceNow’s director of global real estate and workplace, suggests this will include allowing more square metres per person, as well as improving the amount of space in high traffic areas, and re-thinking how we can meet and collaborate in our offices. “One thing that will be key, is how technology will influence the physical environment. When thinking about the role that AI will play in the future workplace, it will help us predict when people are coming in and how we can optimisebetter utilise our spaces to support our employees better. When we talk about our ServiceNow products and how we would use this, reserving your seat or desk in the office will be ‘normal’,” he says.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

Here’s how to navigate the dos and don’tsWorkplace etiquette was a minor minefield before the pandemic. Now, in the wake of Covid-19, navigating an ever changing “new normal” of office interactions has become a major conundrum. Can you stop for a conversation in a one-way space? Should you get a colleague a cup of coffee? What can you do to make remote workers feel like fully integrated team members?There’s no pre-written rulebook for pandemic work etiquette, so let’s look at a few tips for navigating the new manners landscape.1. Keep your distanceIt’s amazing how quickly we’ve moved from an intimate, close-quarters society to one where people hug the sides of corridors upon passing another human. But good manners here are what they’ve always been. That is, you want other people to feel comfortable and at ease, so you should assume relatively strict distancing even if you are personally quite relaxed. If this seems a pain, there are some real upsides here. No more bone-crushing handshakes and no more awkward or clumsy collisions when a colleague or contact leans in for a peck on the cheek. You just waggle your elbows stupidly at each from a metre away from each other and make a joke about how weird it all is.2. Video conferencing v face-to-faceIf you are working on a hybrid or semi-remote team, there are unwritten rules of engagement. Those who are in the office can pick up on nuance and body language in a way that those who are on a video call just can’t. So it falls upon on-site employees to speak as if everyone is on a video call, taking turns and talking clearly. Resist the urge to make asides or get into rapid fire discussions with your in-person colleagues as this excludes those who are working remotely. It’s hard for remote employees to fully participate when it sounds as if they’ve called into the middle of a rugby scrum.4. If people are breaking the rules …A good rule of thumb here is to treat everyone as if they’re innocent at first. Rather than being aggressive or sarcastic you might say: “Mike, I think you forgot we’re meant to be socially distancing here.” Chances are a reminder is all it will take. However, if the person says it’s no big deal or refuses, you might say: “It makes me uncomfortable or anxious,” or “We all have to obey the rules, even if they’re a pain.” In the first case, you’re making it about their effect on you, not their behaviour and in the second, you’re making it about rules that aren’t set by either of you. Both or are non-confrontational and hard to argue with, especially the former.5. Companies can helpLewis Baker, senior workplace services manager at ServiceNow says that it really helps if companies codify the rules and explain them to staff. “We put together a Return to Workplace playbook, which explains the new workplace experience and behaviour we expect of ServiceNow employees upon return. By the time they came back in, they knew what the guidelines were.” He adds that ServiceNow also supplies some of the basics: “We provide masks. We also offer online mindfulness sessions, you know, cooking classes, nutrition advice, and ergonomic advice. We’ll help you to get set up from home and put support mechanisms in place.” Straightforward rules help people understand what is expected and reduces the risk of disagreement and conflict. Companies should also keep staff up to date as government guidelines and scientific advice changes.It truly is a weird new world of work out there. But by staying respectful and keeping it clean, we can all make it through together – apart.The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening.

US forces will continue operations against al-Qaida cells based in Yemen’s desert.Yemen’s civil war escalated sharply in 2015 after the Houthis forced the Yemeni president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia, after which Riyadh launched a military campaign supported by 20 Arab nations to restore the exiled government.Weaponry, vehicles and technical expertise provided by the UK, US and other western nations have been essential to the coalition’s operations. Overwhelming evidence suggests that airstrikes launched from Riyadh have regularly targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure.Biden’s announcement was greeted with cautious optimism by several Yemenis to whom the  spoke on Friday. “This is a long overdue and great step which opens the possibility of shifting to a diplomatic rather than military solution to the war,” said Ahmed Abdo Ali, a resident of Sana’a.Osama alFakih, an advocacy director for Mwatana, one of the only human rights groups still operating in the country, said: “Many Yemenis I know have raised their expectations since yesterday’s announcement to see an end to this war. Ending the US support to the coalition is a good start but not enough. Yemenis need to see real efforts to support accountability and reparations for victims of all warring parties.”Biden’s break with longstanding US policy has raised fresh questions about the UK’s stance on the war. London has continued arms sales to the coalition despite the court of appeal ruling in 2019 that Westminster had not sufficiently examined whether the coalition regularly breached international humanitarian law.Riyadh, which was informed of the US decision to withdraw support before Biden’s speech, said on Friday that it was committed to a political solution to the Yemen conflict and that it welcomed Biden’s ongoing commitment to Saudi defence issues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a3d20665244ca007f86de150b3b90c3d7e9f8a/0_100_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=04ea2c7200cbd955e9ca517fbb62aaf5","title":"when can britain reopen this spring summer and autumns covid calendar","story":"Slow unlocking at the right time and unprecedented vaccine coverage key to avoiding resurgence, scientists sayThe UK’s coronavirus vaccination programme passed a milestone this week, with 10m first doses administered. The rate of jabs is averaging more than 400,000 a day and the government is on course to meet its target of giving first doses to the 15 million most vulnerable people by mid-February.But scientists say that unprecedented vaccine coverage and staged unlocking at the right time are crucial to avoid a devastating resurgence. So, season by season, how might 2020 look?The urgent task over the winter is to vaccinate the 15 million people in the top four priority groups, drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI): care home residents, frontline health and social care workers, the clinically extremely vulnerable and the over-70s.“We will be nowhere near seeing the full effect on the day we vaccinate the last person in that group. It will become more and more apparent in the weeks after,” says Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University.But there are pitfalls to watch out for, he says. Amid the rush to vaccinate, there is a danger substantial numbers of vulnerable people miss out. When lockdown lifts, the virus will still be around, putting those people in danger of hospitalisation and death. “I am very concerned that in the rush to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible we leave people behind, and the people that get left behind will tend to be from minority ethnic groups and deprived areas and they tend to be most at risk from this disease,” Woolhouse says. “We need to be really ambitious, to break records with vaccine coverage, and not move on before we finish the job.”How good the vaccines are at preventing the spread of the virus is not yet clear. Preliminary results from OxfordAstraZeneca trials suggest one shot of their vaccine cuts transmission by two-thirds, but more real-world data is needed. If vaccines do drive down transmission, new infections should fall first in care homes and hospitals. But until vaccines reach younger people, the impact on community cases may not be substantial.If the winter is about vaccinating to prevent deaths, the spring is largely about preventing hospital admissions. While Covid deaths are overwhelmingly concentrated in the over-70s, the middle-aged occupy more hospital intensive care unit beds.“Currently there are large numbers of very ill people in hospital who would have fallen into our priority groups five to nine,” says Anthony Harnden, a GP, professor of primary care at Oxford and deputy chair of the JCVI. Fluctuations in vaccine supply and the need to administer second shots make it hard to predict when these groups will be covered, but the Cabinet Office suggests by May.“Vaccinating these groups will have a much smaller effect on death rates because very few of them die from this disease, but it should have a significant impact on the hospitalisation rate,” says Woolhouse. Again, he emphasises the need for high vaccine coverage to avoid many vulnerable people being left unprotected.If schools reopen as planned, scientists will be keenly watching infection rates and the reproduction number, R. The increased mixing that comes with schools reopening will push R up as much as 0.5 the question will be whether enough people have received first doses to reduce community transmission and counteract the rise.How soon can the rest of society reopen? Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, fears even partial easing of restrictions before May is a bad idea. Harnden also calls for caution. “I would urge patience until at least the spring time or until national restrictions are lifted,” he says. “Vaccination will not offer complete protection against disease and after vaccination you could still transmit infection to others who may be vulnerable. The more the virus is transmitted, the more the virus continues to circulate and the more likely it is to mutate and be one step ahead of us.”In the summer the vaccination programme will push on to cover the 21 million other adults in the UK population, an effort that should get a boost from the arrival of the Moderna vaccine, approved but not yet supplied. “Even when we have vaccinated all the over-50s, that will still mean that over half the population will be unvaccinated and a very high proportion of these will remain susceptible to infection and disease,” says Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London.While better weather will help, the danger in the summer is that vaccine uptake drops off as people in their 20s and 30s feel less at risk from Covid. But high coverage in these groups is essential to keep pushing transmission down, says Tildesley. “This is where the government can really help with very clear messaging and I would start that now. They need to make it very clear that it’s not about you, it’s about protecting everybody else. If we don’t get really high levels of protection across the population, we could be stuck with a level of controls for a really long time.“My hope is we can get to, say, 40m doses by early summer and see strong evidence of it reducing deaths and hospitalisations. Hopefully as we move into May and June we should be in a position for significant relaxation.”Autumn will be time to prepare for the coming winter. The vaccine rollout in the UK and globally will have put pressure on the virus to evolve further, and more transmissible variants, which may be less susceptible to vaccines, may be circulating. Later this year, manufacturers are expected to release updated vaccines tailored for the most dominant variants.From here on, coronavirus vaccination may become as routine as flu shots, with annual rollouts preventing many deaths but by no means all. “It is possible we will have an annual immunisation for coronavirus which is tailored to the predominantly circulating strains at the time, and that may happen as early as this autumn,” says Harnden.Another question for the JCVI is whether to vaccinate children. The PfizerBioNTech jab is approved for age 16 and above, and the OxfordAstraZeneca jab for 18 and older, but trials in younger teenagers are under way.“If the policy is to try to reach the herd immunity threshold, it will certainly be extremely difficult to do that without vaccinating older children,” says Woolhouse. He adds that other measures will be crucial in the meantime. “Mass testing could help us enormously between now and September, and we’ll need to focus on making contact safe and activities safe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6972570ff0bc8e305cd454e742231d7c06f20d1c/0_28_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac709b45c3f47df88af02067e0368b43","title":"new zealands waitangi day 2021 celebrations in pictures","story":"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern helps cook breakfast on the national holiday, which celebrates the signing of the treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840 by Māori chiefs and the British Crown"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb73db18d7b481404717b34afa4be0161edc195/0_61_3219_1932/master/3219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1905beced03dcd5754bfb365e39f3d57","title":"coronavirus live news greece astrazeneca vaccine under 65s melbourne lebanon covid 19 uk europe","story":"Greece becomes latest EU nation to limit vaccine Israel, Lebanon ease lockdowns all contacts of Melbourne hotel quarantine worker, who contracted UK strain and put Australian Open at risk, test negative. Follow liveScientists are helping to “second guess” future mutations of Covid-19 in order to create new potential vaccines, the chairman of the UK vaccines taskforce, Clive Dix, has said. Asked whether it was possible to produce a vaccine that was comprehensive at tackling new mutations, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today:Taking that data and having scientists look very seriously at what’s emerging – where the mutations are occurring, what they might do to the protein – we can kind of second guess some mutations that haven’t even occurred yet and we can go ahead and make those.And that’s part of the collaboration – we’ll make libraries of future vaccines, just small amounts, enough to then, if it does occur, do a quick clinical study to see that it works and then start manufacturing.Dix said studies would help both the world get “ahead of the game” on vaccine-evading new variants. Asked whether there could be a mutation that could escape the current vaccines on offer, he told Today:Of course – when it will occur and whether it will occur is one thing. That’s what happened with flu, we get these pandemic threats with flu. We should learn from flu ... I believe this virus will be very similar – it will last a long time, it will be travelling around the world in different places, it will be endemic in certain countries and we need to do that work, yes.I think there is the possibility but we will be ahead of the game. We’re not going to wait for it to happen – we now have capabilities in the UK to be responsive and that capability won’t just be for the use of the UK of course.

Health ministry data show the number has increased by some 40 cases in just over two weeks. There have been nine deaths.Wednesday saw 16 new cases, 11 of which were in the West New Britain (WNB) province. The province reported its first coronavirus case in November, but infections have been spreading rapidly, standing at 194 and accounting for a fifth of the country’s total.Health officials blamed the spread on the province’s poor response to lockdown, “poor work culture” and poor adherence to infection prevention and control.“This has now placed WNB as a hotspot for Covid-19 in the New Guinea Islands region and it is likely to be transmitting cases to its neighbouring provinces as well as the rest of the country,” the ministry said on its Facebook page on Saturday.Seventeen of Papua New Guinea’s 22 provinces have reported positive cases, with 43,728 tests administered.Intensive care units (ICU) in the UK are still “in the thick of it”, according to a professor of critical care medicine at Imperial College London. Anthony Gordon, an ICU consultant at St Mary’s Hospital in London, asked whether the vaccine programme provided hope that the end of the pandemic was near, told BBC Radio 4’s Today:Yes, I’m hoping that will translate soon. I think we’re all hoping that there is relief from all of this, from the lockdowns and so on eventually, but at the moment we are still very much in the thick of it for a little while longer.Asked about his own experience, he added:What I’m seeing is that we’re still extremely busy. We’ve expanded into these surge ICUs and they are still fully open and full with patients.I think the ever-increasing numbers coming in are starting to plateau – we’re seeing fewer patients coming in now but we’re still full and these patients, once they become ill, stay ill for a long time in the intensive care units, so we’re absolutely full to the rafters still.Russia has reported 16,627 new cases on Saturday, taking the overall national number of confirmed infections to 3,951,233. Russia’s coronavirus crisis centre said 497 more patients had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the Russian official death toll to 76,229.It is “still early days” to start talking about opening up society, Boris Johnson has warned, as reports suggest pubs could reopen in May.Johnson has committed to setting out a “road map” later this month for easing restrictions as he faces pressure from Conservative MPs to relax the current lockdown once the most vulnerable have been vaccinated.Downing Street confirmed on Friday that the vaccine programme planned to reach all those aged 50 and over, as well as adults aged 16-65 in an at-risk group, by May.Mark Harper, the chairman of the Covid Recovery Group – made up of lockdown-sceptic Tory MPs – said it would be “almost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place at all” by the time the top nine groups had been inoculated.The Sun has reported that ministers are preparing to allow pubs to serve takeaway pints in April before fully reopening in May. Restrictions such as the 10pm curfew will be scrapped to ease confusion, the paper suggested.Meanwhile, the  said the prospect of dry pubs was being discussed as an option to allow bars to open their doors in April.A senior government source was dismissive about the idea, telling the PA news agency: “We are not going to open pubs that can’t sell booze. What would be the point of that?”Here’s a little more from the UK’s former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who has told BBC Breakfast that a blanket guarantee over lost income to anyone who is forced to self-isolate may need to be considered.Following NHS Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding’s comments this week that around 20,000 people a day contacted by the system are not fully complying with instructions to self-isolate, Hunt said many are worried about losing their income.I do think we need to look at whether we should give people a blanket guarantee that if they are asked to isolate, the government will make up any salary losses because this is a public health issue.The UK’s former heath secretary Jeremy Hunt believes a 10-year plan and sustained funding increase for the social care sector is needed, saying it goes hand-in-hand with the work being done in the NHS.Hunt, who spent a decade serving in successive Conservative-led governments that focused heavily on swingeing cuts to public services, has told BBC Breakfast:We need to be much better at looking after people at home so they don’t need to go into A\u0026ampE.I think that if there is one thing that comes out of this pandemic that people would support very strongly is to say ‘let’s look at the incredible job done not just by the NHS frontline workers but by care workers’.He said the nation needs to have a “plan B” to continue to tackle the pandemic, despite the successful vaccine programme which has raised hopes of reopening society.In November and early December we weren’t thinking about this Kent variant that arose and there will be other variants.Hunt pointed out that the vaccines minister had said in Parliament that there are 4,000 different mutations around the world, and it may well be that one of those is immune to the vaccines.We need to have a plan B that makes sure that having done all of this work with this brilliant vaccine programme, that is by far the most successful anywhere is Europe, that is not then undermined because we suddenly find ourselves subject to a new mutation that is immune to all these vaccines.And the former heath secretary added that suppressing the virus now should be a key part of plans to deal with potential new variants.The worry that we have to really plan for is that we will have a new mutation that will be immune to the vaccines we are giving out at the moment.In order to make sure we do not get caught out by that again we need to get transmission levels down to the kind of levels where we can do incredibly thorough contact tracing like they do in Korea and Taiwan – several hundred people sometimes from just one case and doing the genomic editing of every single case that we get so that you can understand what it is.When you can get to that level of thoroughness you know you will not have to go back to another lockdown if you have one of these horrible new variants.Intensive care units in some areas of England are seeing a rise in admissions, a consultant Daniele Bryden has said. The vice dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:We know that the picture in the rest of the country is actually quite mixed and that there are some parts of the country, like the Midlands, like the North, that have an increase in numbers in some areas.And that’s on a background that for many of these parts of the country, they’ve not just gone through the second wave of Covid, they’re actually in their third wave of Covid because many of them had sustained pressure in the autumn coming up to the winter.Some units ... are not just under considerable pressure but are still seeing a rise in admissions.The small Central American nation of Honduras, tired of waiting to obtain vaccines through a United Nations program, has secured shots through a private deal, AP reports: With coronavirus cases still climbing, Honduras got tired of waiting to get vaccines through a United Nations program, so the small Central American country struck out on its own, securing the shots through a private deal.Honduras “cannot wait on bureaucratic processes or misguided decisions” to give citizens “the peace of mind” offered by the Covid-19 vaccine, said Juan Carlos Sikaffy, president of the Honduran Private Business Council, which helped complete the purchase by providing a bank guarantee.Other nations are getting impatient too. Unlike past disease outbreaks, where less wealthy countries have generally waited for vaccines to be delivered by the UN and other organisations, many are now taking matters into their own hands. Experts are increasingly concerned that these go-it-alone efforts could undermine a UN-backed program to get Covid-19 shots to the neediest people worldwide.Countries including Serbia, Bangladesh and Mexico recently began vaccinating citizens through donations or commercial deals – an approach that could leave even fewer vaccines for the program known as Covax, since rich countries have already snapped up the majority of this year’s supply.Led by the World Health Organization, a coalition for epidemic preparedness known as CEPI and a vaccine alliance called Gavi, Covax was created to distribute Covid-19 vaccines fairly. Countries can join either to buy vaccines or to get donated shots.Perth, Australia’s fourth largest city, opened up today after a snap, five-day lockdown. Western Australia has thankfully recorded yet another day of zero local transmissions, extending its Covid-free run to five days. That has allowed it to move out of lockdown and into a less onerous set of restrictions. The good result was reflected across the country. Australia did not record a single locally-transmitted case of Covid-19 on Saturday. Relaxed restrictions in Australia have allowed a large crowd to attend horse racing at Royal Randwick racecourse in Sydney. General admission tickets were banned in December after a spike in Covid-19 cases, meaning the first races of the season were without crowds.

Photograph: Marc O’SullivanPoolAFP via Getty ImagesOn Tuesday the letter arrived from chief medical officer Tony Holohan to those involved in rolling out the vaccine programme in the Department of Health, HSE and the Vaccine Task Force. His advice was the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be used in the over-70s because of lack of proof of its efficacy. Yet again the vaccine plan had to be revised and reshaped. We had got used to hearing about supply problems but here was another uncertainty: which vaccines could be used with which groups .So where it is going now in the next few weeks? And what are the vaccination timelines for the months ahead? There will be a few more weeks of sweating about supply, followed by a massive ramp-up, with perhaps two million vaccinated by July or early August.The initial plan for the next few weeks , involving the rollout to the over-70s, has been reshaped by the Vaccine Task Force, chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith working with the HSE and the department. This will start on schedule with the over-85s in the week starting February 15th. But the schedule for completing first vaccines within the wider over-70s group will now slip by a couple of weeks. However, rolling out the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to this group will avoid the long wait for the second shot necessary with AstraZeneca. As well as efficacy, this was one of the reasons for the recommendation to not use AstraZeneca for the over-70s.Timelines are still being finalised, but it appears that group could have substantially received two vaccine shots by later in April, though planning is difficult because only two vaccines can be used with this group now, rather than three.The delivery of Pfizer and Moderna is more complicated due to the need for storage at very cold temperatures and their short shelf-life after they are removed from refrigeration. Delivery plansTo combat this, delivery plans have had to be revised. Vaccines will be delivered directly to bigger GP practices and community hubs will be established where smaller practices can vaccinate their patients. In some cases bigger practices may help out smaller GP practices, while plans are afoot to deal with people who cannot leave their home. One option for them could be the Moderna vaccine, which is more easy to administer than the Pfizer.It will be a huge logistical exercise. The early weeks of the campaign have shown how supply shortfalls can appear out of the blue. But the picture for the first quarter is looking clearer. Originally, it was hoped to have 1.4 million vaccines in the State by the end of March. Now 1.1 million is nailed down, but this could rise perhaps to 1.2 to 1.25 million. Perhaps even higher. The delivery timetable for AstraZeneca supplies will be key here. They begin to arrive this weekend, with 250,000 doses due by the end of March – more than enough for first shots for the 75,000 frontline healthcare workers who have not received any jab yet.Then, there will then be supply to spare, so vital decisions will have to be made about where this goes. Next on the priority list, as currently set out, are healthcare workers not on the front line – up to 20,000, along with nearly 200,000 people aged 65 to 69 and more than 350,000 medically vulnerable people aged 18 to 64.A final decision on this has not yet been made. A key call will be whether it is used on the 65-69 year old age group – since the current advice against using AZ on older people deals only with those aged over 70. New research from AstraZeneca will be closely watched.The vaccination campaign will change massively in April. Numbers will ramp up enormously, with jabs available in GPs, pharmacies, and up to nine large and more than 25 medium-sized mass vaccination centres.Online bookingsPeople using this route will be able to make online bookings, using the HSE’s recently developed IT system. Vaccine supplies will quickly go over 1 million a month and will peak well above this in MayJune, with monthly volume possibly reaching 1.5 million or more at peak.The vaccine schedule will need to ramp up from about 40,000 a week now to over 250,000 a week – and possibly well above that from May on.This depends on the stability of supply, and we have seen the risks. The approval and coming on-stream of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson one-shot vaccine – now submitted for approval with the US authorities – will be vital. It could arrive here by late March or early April. Assuming the supply does arrive, the challenge beyond that will be to work through the priority groups and then the big general population groups, notably the 18-54 year old group which comes towards the end of the priority list. No one is giving commitments on timing – not surprising given the problems in recent weeks. And exact forecasts are impossible because we are not sure yet of supply or who will be given which vaccine and what gap there will be between doses. But if you look at the number of vaccines due to come in and the size of the population, it does suggest that by the middle of the summer the programme will be well advanced into the general adult population, with a good chance of having most adults vaccinated by mid- to late September or October.The benefit from the programme will first show up in mortality and ICU figures as the most vulnerable are covered, and later by a fall in cases. Public health experts warn that more transmissible variants mean 80 per cent of the population need to be covered to get to herd immunity, and even then caution will be needed. If the vaccine numbers arrive and then can be got out, then we should reach the 80 per cent threshold during the summer."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477453.1612558834!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer why is the rollout of covid 19 vaccines so complicated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A member of the Cold Chain warehouse operations team dispensing thawed vials of the PfizerBioNtech Covid-19 vaccine from their boxes.  Photograph: Alan Betson The decision to favour the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for the over-70s over the AstraZeneca jab makes the rollout of the vaccination programme to this next priority group in the vaccine queue more complicated. This is because the Pfizer and Moderna jabs require more complex handling.Why are there difficulties around the rollout of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?These are the vaccines preferred by the State for the over-70s because of the proven data around their effectiveness in older people. The Pfizer vaccine is more complicated to handle but the State is getting roughly four times more of those than the Moderna jabs over the coming weeks.What’s so complicated about it?The Pfizer vaccine is highly effective at preventing people getting seriously ill if they contract Covid-19, but managing, transporting, storing and administering the doses is more complicated and labour intensive.The problem is that it must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures at between -80 and -60 degrees. It must then be transferred to vaccination sites within 12 hours and once it arrives and is defrosted, it has a limited shelf life of five days when stored in a fridge. Any hours used up transporting the vaccine at fridge temperature count against the five-day storage limit.Thawing to room temperature takes 30 minutes and once at room temperature, the vials only last another two hours. Once removed from a fridge, it must be gently inverted 10 times. It must then be diluted with 1.8ml of saline and then have 1.8ml of air removed from the vial before gently inverting the diluted vaccine 10 times again. You are not supposed to shake it.After dilution, each vial contains up to seven doses of 0.3ml of the vaccine. The diluted vaccine can be stored at room temperature but must be used within six hours. They cannot be refrozen.While being stored for those six hours, they should have minimal exposure to room light and no exposure to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light. The Pfizer vaccine gives people 95 per cent protection over two doses, 28 days apart.How is the AstraZeneca vaccine easier to manage?It can be injected by a GP or a pharmacist into a person’s arm straight out of a fridge. The first AstraZeneca vaccines, about 21,000 doses, are expected to arrive into the country this weekend, with hundreds of thousands more expected in the following weeks. The AstraZeneca vaccines, once they arrive, are expected to be used on remaining frontline healthcare workers, who are younger, so more Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would be available to the over-70s.Is the handling of the Moderna vaccine as complicated as the Pfizer vaccine?No, but the State is getting fewer Moderna vaccines.It can be stored frozen at temperatures of between -25 and -15 degrees until expiry and in a fridge for 30 days or at room temperature for 12 hours.Once the vaccine vial has been punctured, it must be used within six hours. A single dose of the vaccine is 0.5ml. Any unused or partially unused vials must be discarded. Two doses of the vaccine, 28 days apart, gives a person 94 per cent protection from serious Covid-19 illness.How are these technical requirements affecting the rollout?The Government and State health officials decided this week that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, rather than the more easily stored AstraZeneca jab, should be given to people aged over 70 where possible. As a result the rollout plan has had to be reworked because a large part of the Government’s original plan and timetable involved older people getting the AstraZeneca vaccine.This now means GPs managing smaller numbers of people will have to go to larger practices because of the challenges of transporting the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. People will also be vaccinated at primary care centres and dedicated centres from February 15th when the over-70s start getting their jabs.The Government is considering ways of getting older people such as the over-85s to vaccination locations and whether transport needs to be provided.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said that he is confident that 70 per cent of GPs will be able to provide the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to patients in their own surgeries.What are the difficulties in vaccinating at smaller sites?In Israel, which has the best vaccine rollout rate in the world, it was found that there were not enough people in the top priority groups to be vaccinated at some smaller localities because Pfizer’s initial specifications said that once the vials were removed from ultra-low-temperature freezers they had to be transported only in large trays containing 195 vials, or about 1,300 doses. Vaccinating at smaller sites would require repackaging vaccines in very low-temperature fridges for distribution in smaller numbers at more remote sites, which is what happened in Israel. In other words, the more people at a vaccination location, the easier it is to administer the Pfizer vaccines.So how many vaccines are needed for this next group to be vaccinated?There are about 480,000 people over the age of 70 who need to be vaccinated requiring 960,000 doses.Supplies vary and the HSE has said that more doses could become available but under rough estimates the State expects 1.2 million vaccine doses by the end of March, including 800,000 Pfizer and Moderna jabs. That means there is expected to be a shortfall of at least 160,000 doses for the over-70s if the target completion date for that group at the end of March is to be met.In other words, vaccinating the population’s next group, the over-70s, will take longer than expected. All this will make getting more people vaccinated more quickly all the more difficult.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477527.1612600225!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"large scale covid vaccination clinics to be set up in dublin cork galway for over 70s","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDetails of the new plan have been worked out following talks between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation. Photograph: Sebastian Gollnowdpa via APA number of large-scale vaccination clinics are to be established in Dublin, Cork and Galway under new plans for administering the Covid-19 vaccine to those over the age of 70.Under the new plans the first of these clinics will be set up at Dublin City University (DCU) where patients attached to 121 practices across the capital will receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.Details of the new plan have been worked out following talks between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO).However most patients over the age of 70 will still receive the Covid vaccine from their own family doctor practice.In a bulletin to its members on Friday night, seen by The , the IMO said some 72,000 people over 85 will be first to be vaccinated, the first of 490,000 over 70s around the State. The over 85s are to be vaccinated in three week-long slots, starting on February 15th “during which time the objective is to vaccinate patients over 85 and then continue on with the age schedule”. ‘Buddying up’ systemPatients will all receive two doses of either Pfizer or Moderna. The vast majority of patients will be vaccinated in their own GP practice – some 70 per cent of GP practices will see their patients vaccinated on site – with deliveries through the HSE’s cold chain to all practices with more that 200 over 70s. Those practices will need to have a registration area, a refrigeration area – which will double as an area for vaccines to be reconstituted – and a vaccination area and an observation area. These will be managed by GPs, admin staff and nurses. However, for practices with fewer than 200 over 70s – some 400 practices – vaccinations will take place on two pathways. The first will be through GP vaccination clinics, and the second pathway is through a “buddying up” system. The vaccination clinics in urban centres will be at agreed locations – among the first of these will be in DCU, where 121 practices will come together to run clinics. Booking, registration and payment will happen through GPs own practices – with doctors told “the only change is the venue at which the patient will receive the vaccine”. The clinics will operate “in the agreed age phases until all these patients are vaccinated and at the 28 day intervals”. They will run at the weekend.The “buddying up system”, outside urban centres, will also involve practices with fewer than 200 patients over 70, who will be paired with a larger practice in their area. Patients from smaller practices will attend the larger practice, but will be dealt with by their GP and his or her staff. Indemnity arrangementsIn order to facilitate planning, GPs will be asked to identify and register the patients over 70, in each age cohort, and invite them for vaccination at the relevant venue – either their own practice, a vaccine clinic, or a “buddied up” practice. Once that process is complete, the order of vaccines can be placed and syringes, needles and vaccine cards will be delivered. GPs will have a delivery every two weeks. According to the IMO, indemnity arrangements will cover GPs and practice nurses. Members were told the hope is that all GPs and practice nurses will be vaccinated prior to the programme beginning – those not vaccinated will be facilitated through acute hospitals. They will be given the AstraZeneca vaccine – except where they have been given a different vaccine first, in which case the same will be given in a second dose.Economic costsDetails of the new vaccination plan emerged as Ministers were told last week that the State is is burning through its €5.5 billion in coronavirus contingency funding at a higher rate than anticipated, The  has learned.A meeting of the Cabinet’s economic subcommittee, attended by senior Ministers and the Taoiseach this week, heard that the fund – comprising two separate reserves apportioned for at budget time last year – has been tapped earlier than expected, for greater amounts, and is likely to be needed for longer than anticipated. While the State’s coffers are well stocked and borrowing is cheap, the current and anticipated call on the reserve funds illustrates the massive extent of interventions needed due to the current harsh lockdown, as well as the likely persistence of Level 5 restrictions for the foreseeable future, Government sources said.Budget 2021 was drawn up based on pessimistic assumptions around a no-deal Brexit and the unavailability of viable coronavirus vaccines – neither of which have come to pass, meaning the economic backdrop is somewhat better than anticipated. However, the enormous impact of the third coronavirus wave is much more onerous than had been planned for.Baseline secenarioThe budgetary “baseline scenario” was that the economy would co-exist with the virus, with phased restrictions ebbing and flowing but no full lockdown. It also assumed the economic costs of further lockdowns would be less severe. Ministers at the meeting on Thursday also accepted that no firm date can be set down for ending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, even though the number receiving the payment is lower than at the peak last year. There was uncertainty too about when the wider economy can reopen, although there is growing confidence within Government that construction can reopen relatively early. It was conceded that the most stricken sectors of hospitality, travel, tourism and the arts will remain moribund for some time. “We can’t allow these sectors to disappear,” said one Minister. “We have to keep them on life support.”Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly confirmed the first batches of the AstraZeneca vaccine will arrive in Ireland this weekend, with 43,000 doses expected over the next week. “We expected 190,000 doses in total to arrive in February. They will be administered straight away,” Mr Donnelly told RTÉ. Studies have concluded that AstraZeneca is highly effective among people over 70, but Irish authorities have recommended the use of only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for that upper age cohort because of a lack of data until now on the efficacy of AstraZeneca among older people. New casesA total of 1,047 new cases of the virus were reported yesterday and 35 deaths. Some 1,221 people are currently in hospital with virus symptoms, of whom 181 are in ICU units. Separately, Minister for Education Norma Foley has disclosed her department is planning for a combination of Leaving Certificate examinations and an alternative assessment option, not involving exams. No details have been disclosed of the nature of the assessment option but senior officials in education will now begin bilateral engagement with the relevant bodies. The Garda will begin issuing €100 fines from next Monday to motorists from Northern Ireland who cross the Border without a reasonable excuse for travelling. The Health Act 1947 has been amended to include those not ordinarily resident in the State as being liable for the fines.

Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyCork Courts LimitedAfter months of harassment and threats from a former colleague, Una Ring went to bed on a miserable Co Cork night last July fully dressed, suspecting her stalker might try to take advantage of the rotten weather.The conditions, she recalled, were “so bad I remember saying to a friend of mine that it might the type of night that would draw him out because he wouldn’t think anyone else would be out in such weather, so I went to bed fully dressed that night.“I woke about 2am and I couldn’t get back to sleep, so I was actually awake and heard muffled voices and I heard metal hitting concrete because he had thrown away the crowbar. I got up and went into the bedroom next door and we watched from there, so we saw the whole thing unfold.”James Steele (52), who threatened to break into Ms Ring’s house in Youghal and rape her and her daughter if she did not agree to sleep with him, was jailed on Thursday for five years.He was caught by gardaí with a crowbar, a rope, duct tape and a sex toy outside Ms Ring’s home in the early hours of July 27th. Ms Ring, a mother of two, waived her right to anonymity to encourage others in similar situations to come forward as she spoke about her experience following his jailing.Speaking to The  on Friday, she said she had been terrified a fortnight before Steele was caught when she discovered a letter on her car windscreen containing two condoms and sexually suggestive comments, which concluded “I am watching you”.“I found that letter terrifying ,” she said. “He had painted my car tyres and painted my window with noughts and crosses but that was sort of childish so part of me thought it might be some bored teenager in the estate, but the letter was very frightening.CCTV installation“It was at that point that the gardaí advised me to put in CCTV and luckily a friend of my brother was able to install it that night, so that was in place when he came back a week later on the night of July 23rd and left another letter on the windscreen of my car.“The contents of the letter were again terrifying but the fact that he was captured on CCTV and we were able to confirm that it was him was kind of a relief.”She said gardaí began patrolling the estate from the time she received the first letter. After the second letter was found, gardaí put a surveillance operation in place and were there four nights later when her stalker arrived.Ms Ring said she felt as if “a huge weight had been lifted” when Steele was arrested.“You had been living on your nerves for so long and then the adrenalin kicks in. I wouldn’t say I was as high as a kite, but I was definitely ecstatic and there was this huge sense of relief,” she said, adding that she “went cold” when she realised Steele had a crowbar and other items and was “intent on acting out what he had threatened”.Return to normalityNow trying to return to some sort of normality after the stress of the court case and a round of media interviews, Ms Ring has found time to reflect on what Steele’s family must now be going through.“This isn’t about him. He has a wife and family who did nothing wrong. As a mother myself, I would hate for my kids to go through something like this,” she said. “What we went through is completely separate but to be honest I think what they are going to be going through is nearly worse.”Ms Ring said the victims in these situations get support and sympathy whereas “the perpetrator’s family are kind of tarnished”.“ I’m not over this yet but my side of it is done whereas their side is only starting in one sense, so I just want people to be kind to them because they are probably going through worse than I am now.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477314.1612602399!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu handling of covid has had lots of lows but critics ignore things it got right","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. There is no doubt that the past 12 months have been replete with strategic mistakes and gaffes, and the EU would be foolish not to take account of that. Photograph:  Olivier HosletEPAThe braying of the Tory press in Britain has become deafening the malicious chortling of the Brexit-supporting newspapers and politician growing to a crescendo as the European Union’s bungling drowned out the news of 100,000 British deaths.Humiliation, boomed the Daily Mail. Disaster, screeched the Daily . Total disaster, insisted the .Even Irish officials, comrades in arms of the Brussels bureaucrats and co-residents in the Brexit trenches with the Brussels bureaucrats shrug and admit it: the EU is having a dreadful pandemic. That perception was heightened by the disastrous attempt by the European Commission to use emergency provisions to block vaccines from entering Northern Ireland last week. Though quickly abandoned, the commission’s move has inflamed unionist opinion and put the EU on the defensive politically in a way not seen throughout the whole Brexit process.Even supporters of the EU – and strong support for the EU is the default position among most of the Irish political and governing class – acknowledge that the past year has been something of an annus horribilis for the bloc. But sometimes a snappy judgment that fits into a tabloid headline is not the whole story the truth is rather more complex.While the EU’s management of its vaccine supply has been slow and cumbersome compared to both the United States and the United Kingdom, and its attempt to institute a common travel framework has ended in shreds, the EU has also effectively underwritten the vast deficit spending that has sustained governments and societies for much of the past year. The EU’s handling of the pandemic has had plenty of low points but critics tend to ignore the things it got right.The crisis arrivesItaly was the canary in the coal mine: the first clusters were detected in late February of last year, followed quickly by the first deaths, and then the first lockdowns. At the same time, travellers from other parts of Europe were still departing for ski vacations in the Italian Alps.The gravity of the situation became brutally clear on March 6th, when Italy’s professional association of anaesthesiologists issued guidance to health workers on how to pick which patients to save when there was not enough equipment or doctors to go around.Within days, Austria had closed its border with Italy, followed by a cascade of similar measures by the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Spain. The unravelling of freedom of movement, which left EU citizens stranded as they attempted to commute cross-border to work or return home from abroad, gave the commission its first challenge. But the power of the commission to intervene was severely constrained. Health and borders are purely national powers, meaning that up until that point it was unclear how the EU could collectively respond to the pandemic. Keeping truck routes from snarling up and cross-border lives from being disrupted was the first issue on which EU national governments looked up from firefighting the burgeoning pandemic emergency at home, and began to co-operate. But soon member states were pitted against each other in a mad scramble for PPE. The competition was rancorous: Germany slapped export controls on equipment including ventilators, causing uproar in Italy. On both travel and medical equipment, agreement was reached to lift curbs within the EU at the price of enforcing them on the rest of the world. It was a shaky start, but enough to avert disaster.MoneyThe next steps were financial, and more assured. The commission suspended the usual budget rules to give member states a free rein to borrow and spend. The European Central Bank launched a massive emergency bond-buying programme to keep debt cheap. And the commission opened its cheque book, offering cheap loans to member states to pay for unemployment support programmes, while pushing out money in funding for medical research, health systems, and cheap business loans.This was a precursor to the truly ground-breaking moves of the summer. First, a pledging initiative that raised €15.9 billion “to help develop and ensure equitable access to coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments”. Then, a move previously considered unthinkable: joint borrowing, to the tune of €750 billion, to be pushed out to member states in a mix of grants and loans to counteract the economic impact of the pandemic. The fact that Italian borrowing costs have remained steady, averting the prospect of the feared repeat of the euro zone debt crisis, is widely seen as proof of the success of these measures.But the pandemic also drew the commission into taking on new roles in unfamiliar areas, and in these its record has been less positive.In April 2020, commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced “it is time to look ahead and to focus on protecting livelihoods”, launching a plan aimed to co-ordinate EU-wide lifting of coronavirus containment measures. Health commissioner Stella Kyriakides announced that the “only way” was “to learn to live with this virus”.The following month, the commission launched a plan to “reboot tourism” and “to allow people to take holidays and catch up with their friends and families”. Both were driven by economic concerns, particularly a clamour from airlines, the hospitality industry and tourism-dependent member states.The short-sightedness is now apparent. A strain of Covid-19 that first emerged among Spanish farm workers in June accounted for 60 per cent of all cases in Ireland and 80 per cent of those in the UK by October, an international team of scientists found, indicating that holiday travel had fuelled the second wave that swept the continent, forcing renewed school closures and lockdowns in autumn.Healthcare is a “national competence”, and member states have never successfully co-ordinated on their health policy responses to the pandemic. They listened to the commission, but when cases started to rise, they turned inward. They have different expert advice, different national circumstances, and a different balance of power between vying interests. In some member states health policy is not even nationally coherent, as it is under the control of regional powers. In France, quarantine lasts seven days: in most places, it is 10 or 14. Travel measures still vary across the continent. The EU’s attempt to institute a common “traffic-light” framework in the summer never succeeded in achieving its aim of a common EU-wide travel policy.VaccinesThe global race for vaccines began almost as soon as the pandemic. Back in March, then-US president Donald Trump was offering cash to German biotech company CureVac to relocate to the US and exclusively produce its Covid-19 vaccine candidate there.By April, Germany and France were working together on acquiring vaccines, a club soon joined by the Netherlands and Italy. Alarmed, smaller EU countries demanded the commission step in. A deal was done: the 27 would negotiate as a bloc, but the original four would each have a member on the seven-strong joint vaccine negotiating team, along with Portugal, Spain, and Poland. They set out to pick the most promising candidates out of roughly 150 candidate vaccines, based on promising early data and ability to manufacture at scale, and sign deals to lock down early supplies.A key sticking point in the talks was liability. Pharmaceutical companies are used to being shielded from legal liability in the US if there are problems with a product made in an emergency. The joint EU team stuck out for the drugmakers to accept liability. The haggling prolonged negotiations.The first contract was signed with AstraZeneca, in August, for up to 400 million doses of the vaccine developed with Oxford University in exchange for €336 million to pay for vaccine development and advance production, according to commission officials. This vaccine was cheap, produced at cost, and easy to roll out, not requiring deep-freeze storage. Deals with Sanofi for 300 million doses, and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson for 400 million doses soon followed. But the next candidate, BioNTech-Pfizer, was a harder sell with member states: more expensive and tricky to roll out, requiring deep freeze storage. It was also based on a less familiar technology.Impatient, Germany began doing its own deals on the side with BioNTech and CureVac, both homegrown companies, in September. The commission closed three deals for the pricier mRNA vaccines in November, with CureVac (405 million doses), Moderna (160 million doses), and BioNTech-Pfizer (300 million doses, later doubled).It is hard to find an Irish politician or official who believes the country would have been better off negotiating independently with the pharmaceutical companies. “The alternative would have been catastrophic, a bidding war between member states,” said Ciarán Cuffe, the Green MEP. This may be true, but the slow pace of the vaccine programme attests to one of the EU’s most basic difficulties: agreeing anything between 27 parties takes time. And in a vaccination programme, speed is of the essence.Meanwhile, Israel, the UK and the US speeded up the rollout of their vaccination programmes as their national regulators granted emergency approval for their use. Technically, any EU member state could have done the same, though governments would have been on the hook for liability if anything went wrong. Instead, the EU took the normal route of regulatory approval for the entire bloc at once through the European Medicines Agency, a more rigorous process that requires more evidence of safety and efficacy. Given high rates of vaccine scepticism on the continent, this was also widely seen as the wisest way forward.There are plenty of questions however about the choice of which vaccines to purchase, when and in what quantities. The delay in finalising a deal with BioNTech-Pfizer is viewed poorly.“In defence of the commission, the members states had to agree to every step of the procurement,” Andrews said. “We are Europeanising failure and nationalising success at every point.”War with AstraZeneca The subsequent delay in rolling out shots to citizens – at least in comparison with the UK and US – has coincided with a bad patch of the pandemic, particularly in Ireland. Faced with rising frustration from member states that were demanding more doses faster, and public opinion souring, the commission made a bid to seize control in the past fortnight. It has made an astonishing mess of it.AstraZeneca’s announcement in January that it could deliver only 31 million doses to the EU by April was a shock to the commission, which had initially expected north of 100 million, and later 80 million. In response, the commission went on the offensive, suggesting that doses made in the EU had been unjustly shipped elsewhere and declaring it would publish its contract with the pharmaceutical company to show that it was in breach. While AstraZeneca presented doses from British factories as being intended for Britain, and vice versa for the EU, the commission said four factories including two in the UK were named in its contract as sources of supply. The initial doses rolled out in the UK had also been made in the Netherlands and Germany.In a power play, last week the commission announced it would require all pharmaceutical companies to declare what vaccines they were exporting from the EU and where. At the strong demand of France and Germany, this proposal was hardened into an export control regulation. Not only would pharmaceutical companies have to declare their exports, but they would have to receive permission from national governments to go ahead with them. If the doses were deemed to be contractually owed to the EU, they could refuse permission to export.At some point, Northern Ireland’s special post-Brexit arrangements were identified as a potential loophole to the controls in theory, the North could be a backdoor for vaccine exports to Britain. Article 16 was introduced into the text to allow member states to refuse permission for vaccine exports if they were deemed to be moving through Northern Ireland en route to Britain. When the proposed regulation was published, it kicked off a political storm that continues to rage through Belfast, London and Dublin. It was, Irish officials – generally the EU’s staunchest allies – said, the biggest mistake they could remember the commission making. It has deeply undermined von der Leyen. “The EU has been damaged,” says one Irish official. “A lot of this will come to rest on VDL. She’s not in danger. But she is damaged.”LessonsThis is a particularly bad point for the EU in the pandemic. But by the summer, more than 400 million doses of EU-sourced vaccines are expected to have been administered to citizens, and life will have returned, if not to normal, then to a more congenial post-lockdown state.But there is no doubt that the past 12 months have been replete with strategic mistakes and gaffes, and the EU would be foolish not to take account of that. What messages can the EU learn? One is that it must constantly push for quicker decision-making. Humility is another lesson it should learn from British successes on the vaccine. Though it no longer matters what the British newspapers think let them gloat. The fact is on the most important measures – deaths from the virus – the UK has been one of the worst performers in the world. The performance of EU countries varies widely. That’s why much of the UK bombast is overblown: the EU is not responsible for the management of the pandemic in inidual countries.Perhaps most importantly, the pandemic is a lesson to the EU to stick to the things it’s good at. The pandemic has confirmed that while the EU is an economic superpower, it is very much not a superpower of practical government. The current bout of flagellation will pass. Brussels will get over it. “There’s no doubt that the EU is pretty chastened,” says one Irish diplomat. “But it won’t remain so for ever.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477514.1612562375!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord seanad byelection talk puts covid in the ha penny place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIan Marshall, the former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union and Leo Varadkar’s nominee to the Upper House in 2016, has thrown his hat in the ring for the Agriculture panel.  Photograph: Patrick BolgerBloombergThe big question this week in the virtual corridors of power was: why aren’t we hearing more about Covid-19 on radio and television and why are the newspapers ignoring it?Why is nobody talking about vaccines? What about the latest figures?Is there not a doctor or a professor anywhere who might be persuaded to say something? Why the silence on overseas travel and mandatory quarantine? Where are the experts to tell us about our mental health? Why oh why can’t someone be found to tell us how to cookmind the dogstay sober during the pandemic?All we hear, 247, is people banging on about the Seanad byelections. Don’t mind telling you that I’ve got to the stage now where I’m ing at the radio to turn it off the minute I hear someone say they’re going to discuss the prospects for the Industrial and Commercial panel with a leading pundit from the University of Life.But what can you do?As everyone knows, there are two vacancies arising from the resignations in September and October of Fine Gael’s Michael D’Arcy from the Agriculture panel and Sinn Féin’s Elisha McCallion from the aforementioned widely talked-about Industrial and Commercial panel.The election process is horrendously complicated, even though the electorate only comprises the membership of the Dáil and Seanad. The race is under way now that two Senators (Independent Victor Boyhan in Darcy’s case and Sinn Féin’s Niall Ó Donnghaile in McCallion’s) have moved motions calling for the clerk of the Upper House to notify the Minister to get his skates on and name the election date.Darragh O’Brien is the Minister in question. He’s a fast mover, is the Minister for Local Government. We asked his spokesperson on Friday when the election will take place.“No date set yet” and they “don’t know yet when one will be set”.There is a gentlemen’s agreement between the two main Government parties to vy up the seats. If all Government TDs and Senators vote as instructed, their candidates will win. But it’s a private vote.Fianna Fáil has dibs on the Industrial and Commercial seat, with 13 candidates hoping to win the nomination. Ballot papers went out this weekend and a resultcandidate is expected on Tuesday night.Fine Gael has dibs on the Agriculture panel and the well-regarded former senator Maria Byrne, from Limerick, is the party’s candidate. On the numbers, she should win. But as the shock result in last year’s vote for Leas-Cheann Comhairle showed, Government candidate Fergus O’Dowd lost to Catherine Connolly when an estimated 15 Government TDs defied instructions in the secret vote.The problem for Maria Byrne is that Ian Marshall, the former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union and Leo Varadkar’s nominee to the Upper House in 2016, has thrown his hat in the ring.Marshall, who is from a unionist background, wrote this week to all Oireachtas members seeking their support. Sinn Féin has already pledged its support for him.The Armagh man was disappointed when Micheál Martin’s new Government didn’t appoint anyone from north of the Border to the Seanad. “Any talk of a shared island is just a farce,” he said at the time. “How can you have a shared island if you only talk to yourself?”He is fighting the byelection on his record in agriculture and farming, his Seanad record and as an independent unionist voice.“This seat has become even more important now with the fallout from Brexit, the IrelandNI protocol, trade issues north, south, east and west and the ongoing impact of the global pandemic across the island.”Among his supporters is Senator Gerard Craughwell, who has accused FF and FG of a “carve-up” of the two seats. “Old habits die hard, especially when we look into the Irish political establishment.”He says the Government is not interested in putting forward candidates with expert knowledge in their vocational panels and accuses Fine Gael of nominating someone “with absolutely no interest or knowledge in agriculture to the agricultural panel”.He alleges Maria Byrne only spoke twice on farming issues during her five years in the Seanad. “Surely now more than ever we need impartial, unbiased, expert opinion in the Upper House,” argues Craughwell.“Having busted through the cronyism myself in 2014, I hope we can do it again.”Meanwhile, the Green Party has yet to decide whether to enter the field. “We haven’t decided anything. Internal discussion is only taking place on it now,” said a spokesman. Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu has been mentioned as a possible runner.If the Healy-Rae cap fits...A very serious situation developed on Wednesday morning when a Sinn Féin TD was accused of grand larceny involving the possible mugging of a fellow deputy outside the auditorium where the ridiculously distanced Health and Safety Dáil now sits.After he had spoken on his party’s motion calling for an extension of the €28 fuel allowance to all recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Mark Ward was approached by TDs from a number of parties (including his own) and accused of stealing Michael Healy-Rae’s cap.The deputy for Dublin Mid-West vociferously denied the allegations. He was, however, wearing a black flat cap on his head at the time which looked suspiciously like the one usually cemented onto the Kerry parliamentarian’s bonce.Healy-Rae, it was darkly noted, was nowhere to be seen.Furthermore, Ward delivered his televised speech while brazenly modelling said item of headgear. He cleverly tried to disguise its provenance by the addition of a small enamel Easter lily badge and a pin depicting the Clondalkin Round Tower.What was going on? Nobody, apart from MHR, has ever worn a black flat cap in the Dáil chamber before this week. He had to fight Leinster House authorities to be allowed wear it. A gentleman sporting a hat in the chamber was always viewed as a most serious contravention of the dress code. He won that permission in February 2017.A battle which has gone down in the Leinster House annals of millinery history.Exactly three years later and Mark Ward surfaces in the Convention Centre wearing the famous cap. Obviously, questions were asked.We are happy to report that the first-time TD from Clondalkin is entirely innocent of all charges.“My 14-year-old daughter Muireann cut my hair at home – it was my socially distanced Covid haircut. I wore the cap because my head was cold,” Mark tells us, having cleared his name with his colleagues. He bought it last winter and Wednesday was the first time he wore it in the Dáil chamber.He didn’t ask permission to wear it and would never have thought of doing so.“Anyway, the Healy-Raes don’t own the rights to the wearing of caps,” he added. “And also, Michael Healy-Rae is always crying that we don’t do anything past the Red Cow roundabout. I’d like him to know that the Red Cow roundabout is in my constituency and I work way beyond it.”Two Healy-Rae hats in the Dáil now?Dear God, let it not be the start of a new fashion.Humphreys outed by Leo as first-time grannyHeather Humphreys didn’t want to make a big fuss about her recent good news, so she was surprised when her phone suddenly began to hop with good wishes from her Dáil and Seanad colleagues.What she didn’t realise (having temporarily tuned out of the Zoom call) was that Leo Varadkar had just announced the glad tidings to the weekly parliamentary party meeting.“Next minute, all I could see was ‘Congratulations Granny!’ coming up on my screen.”The Minister for Social Protection and Rural and Community Development has been on cloud nine since her daughter Eva and son-in-law Seán welcomed young Arthur into the world.“He’s a lovely wee fella altogether,” says first-time grandmother Heather. “He’ll be two weeks old on Monday.”Arthur H Egan, to be precise. The “H” stands for Humphreys. “I think it was lovely to get the mother’s family name in too,” says Humphreys (nee Stewart). The Kennedys had the same idea when christening JFK.She’s not so keen on the “granny” moniker, though. “I’ve told them all, ‘You can say it twice but after three grannies, you’re dead’. I don’t want to hear it. I’m allowing them a couple of chances and then that’s it.”Due to Covid restrictions the christening will have to wait.“The way things are going I’d say he’ll be walking up to the font by the time we get over all of this. He’ll be able to jump into it himself.”And drive everyone to the church in Monaghan for the ceremony.TDs can’t keep their distanceThe strict rule on numbers allowed into the Convention Centre auditorium means parties must keep a close eye on how many TDs are inside any one time.It’s easy for people to lose concentration in the Health and Safety Dáil where, unbelievably, a mere 45 TDs out of 159 can commune briefly together in a temporary chamber which doubles as a 2,000-seat, three-storey auditorium. Those who get a golden ticket to come and talk into the void must feel very special indeed.But for all the wide open space cocooning the precious politicians, nothing can account for human behaviour. They may be rattling around like peas in a drum, but it doesn’t stop them forgetting about their masks, or conferring closely or steaming up to the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle to vent their annoyance when they feel overlooked in the speaking list.Catherine Connolly was forced to address those storming the citadel on Wednesday. “I want to say something in relation to the Order of Business and TDs approaching me. There’s a pandemic and the closeness of the contact is unacceptable.”So a maximum of 45 TDs are strung around an enormous hall – chosen because it is so much bigger than the Dáil chamber and expensively fitted-out to accommodate all members when necessary – and they still can’t get it right.Most deputies think the Convention Centre set-up is over the top. But when they question it, they say, they are immediately silenced with those three magic words: “health and safety”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477366.1612602312!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no one in government has appetite to push back against holohan","story":" The decision to recommend only a certain type of Covid-19 vaccine for people over the age of 70 has thrown the State’s carefully-calibrated inoculation plan up in the air and revealed once again the dominant role of chief medical officer Tony Holohan.Just over a week ago, on January 29th, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorisation for the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for over-18s, based on a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).The EMA scientific experts said the vaccine could be used in older adults, despite most participants in AstraZeneca’s studies being aged between 18 and 55. Protection could be expected, they believed, “given that an immune response had been seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines”.On the same day, Dr Holohan asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) to look at the European advice and specifically address the issue of using the vaccine in older adults.The group immediately held a wide-ranging discussion. In their deliberations, they looked at the risks of disease and the benefits afforded by the vaccines. They discussed vaccine safety, efficacy, age-specific vaccine data and the likely length of time between injection and protection from Covid-19.The NIAC team also talked about the potential impact on confidence and trust in the vaccination programme, something which has occupied minds in Government Buildings since the national campaign kicked off.Wasting no time in their deliberations, the NIAC provided their advice to Dr Holohan on Monday. The next day, the chief medical officer sent this to the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly along with his own recommendations.Political sources have conceded that what NIAC recommended was different to what Dr Holohan would himself recommend.The advisory group said “any currently authorised Covid-19 vaccine can be given to adults of all ages, including those aged 70 and older”. Crucially, they said the vaccination of those aged 70 and older “should not be delayed”.“Where practicable and timely, those aged 70 and older should be given an mRNA vaccine.” PfizerBioNTech and Moderna are mRNA vaccines.This is in contrast to Dr Holohan’s advice that “due to superior efficacy demonstrated by mRNA vaccines, including in older persons (albeit the data is limited) and in recognition of their particular vulnerability in terms of their increased risk of death and serious disease if they contract SARS- CoV-2, it is recommended that mRNA vaccines be administered to all those over 70 years in order to provide the highest level of protection available to this population”.There was another element to his recommendations that would prove to be important. He told the Minister that “assurance should be provided by the HSE that vaccine supplies will be sufficient to progress this important objective in a timely fashion”.For some in the Department of Health, the plan seemed quite simple by Wednesday: both the Minister and Dr Holohan would endorse the recommendations from NIAC.But that evening, alarm bells were sounding in the Department of the Taoiseach. A number of sources who spoke to The  said the issues were as follows: there were “more questions than answers”, there was not enough detail on what the HSE response would be, and there was that matter of how Dr Holohan “went further” than the advisory group.The idea of delaying vaccinations for the over-70s at a time when the NIAC said this should not happen also rankled.Programme recastGiven the importance of maintaining trust in the vaccination programme, officials in the Taoiseach’s department believed there was little to no choice but to recast the vaccination programme so that only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, known as mRNA vaccines, would be given to those over 70.Those close to Mr Donnelly say he was in close alignment with the chief medical officer on the issue. Those helping to co-ordinate the pandemic response 500 metres away in Merrion Street were aware this was a sizeable bump in the road and would result in much scrambling, both in the HSE and for the high-level vaccine task force.Despite this, there was no public questioning of the chief medical officer despite the ramifications. There was instead a widespread feeling that after the events of Christmas, pretty much no one in Government had the appetite to push back against Dr Holohan.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477066.1612531674!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the needle and the good work done","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBy the early 20th century the syringe was in higher demand and eventually became a key tool of vaccine deliveryNeedles make me squeamish. I don’t think I’m alone. This is only one of the many reasons that I did not become a doctor. But needles are very useful tools for delivering medicine and, of chief concern this moment, for delivering vaccines.Before the arrival of the hypodermic syringe pretty much everything a doctor wanted to put into your body had to arrive by mouth. (Or via anal suppositories, but let’s leave those aside for now).The exceptions were, for example, smallpox vaccines that were delivered by making a small cut in the skin. But while this worked to deliver enough vaccine lymph, it has to be said it wasn’t a very efficient way of delivering a medicine.There are competing claims to being the first inventor of the hypodermic syringe. Some experiments had occurred in the 17th century that involved “needles” that were not at all narrow. Anyone for a sharpened quill stuck into your vein? No? I thought not.An interest in local pain relief led doctors to explore ways of getting a drug under the skin in the mid 19th century. The syringe, or plunger part, had long existed as a technology. The innovation was coupling a tiny hollow needle with the syringe.In 1844, an Irish doctor called Francis Rynd described treating neuralgia by injecting morphine under the skin. He has been suggested by some as the inventor of the hypodermic syringe but he didn’t use a syringe at all.Instead, his needle sort of punched a little hole in the skin and then the medicine dripped in by gravity. A “proper” hypodermic syringe forces liquid through a needle and under the skin by the application of pressure.Pain relief Most historians now ascribe the invention to Alexander Wood of Edinburgh. Wood, like Rynd, was looking to relieve the pain of neuralgia in a patient. He was motivated to try hypodermic injection because his patient vomited when given morphine by mouth. His syringe was made of glass but the needle was metal and hollow with one end made into a point.Wood was pleased with the outcome of his experiment and later wrote about it for a local Edinburgh medical journal. He presented it to the British Medical Association’s meeting in Edinburgh in 1858.In describing his results he hinted at an even greater benefit of hypodermic injection, one that Rynd does not seem to have considered. The drug, morphine in this case, would be carried around the body by the blood stream. Injection would therefore provide more than local pain relief or indeed local delivery of a medicine.Something similar to Wood’s innovation may have been used in Paris around the same time but it took quite a while to catch on more generally. The English doctor Charles Hunter seems to have been the first to grasp the importance of a local injection providing more general relief. Instead of injecting the sites of neuralgia in his patients, he injected them elsewhere and they experienced the same relief from pain.You can probably already guess the downside to this story. Before the addictive nature of morphine was fully understood, doctors had invented a more efficient way of delivering it.Injecting morphine seemed to be better tolerated than swallowing it. Some doctors became quite enthusiastic for treating their own neuralgia, over and over again. In other words, they became addicted to morphine.The focus on using the syringe for pain relief is understandable. Morphine produced a noticeable effect in an era where such treatments were few and far between.But use soon expanded with the discovery of new vaccines. In 1885, Louis Pasteur used a hypodermic syringe to administer his first rabies vaccine in Paris.By the early 20th century the syringe was in higher demand and eventually became a key tool of vaccine delivery. Many of our hopes for a better future are now pinned on them.Juliana Adelman is an associate professor of history in Dublin City University – @AdelmanJuliana"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477041.1612533875!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"you have no authority here chaotic uk council zoom meeting storms internet","story":"A Handforth council meeting in Cheshire, England that descended into chaos – with councillors trading insults and ultimately getting booted off the Zoom call – has become an internet sensation. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA screengrab dated December 10th, 2020, shows parish clerk Jackie Weaver during a Zoom meeting of Handforth Parish Council. Image: Handforth Parish CouncilPA WireA parish council meeting that descended into chaos – with councillors trading insults and ultimately getting booted off the Zoom call – has become an internet sensation.A video of the Handforth council meeting in Cheshire showed it starting badly when one unseen councillor apparently muttered swear words under his breath as the clerk tried to bring the session to order.Things did not improve. The meeting quickly degenerated into rancour with councillors in the village near Wilmslow trading insults and ultimately being booted off the Zoom call by the clerk.Footage of the extraordinary exchanges has been shared thousands of times on Twitter. The name of the heroically stoic clerk, Jackie Weaver, who was apparently parachuted in to run the meeting amid accusations of poor behaviour by councillors, became a Twitter trend on Thursday evening and spawned several memes.During the meeting, which took place on December 10th, chairman Brian Tolver was removed after the councillor refused to recognise the legitimacy of the meeting.In the recording, he told Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, to stop talking, adding: “You have no authority here”. In response, Ms Weaver removed Mr Tolver from the Zoom call and placed him in a virtual waiting room.After Mr Tolver’s eviction, vice-chair Aled Brewerton, joined by another man, proceeded to shout at Weaver to “read the standing orders”.When fellow councillor Susan Moore called for civility, the meeting erupted into semi-hysterical laughter and a two further councillors, Mr Brewerton and Barry Burkill, were removed.The absurd scenes continued with confusion over Mr Tolver’s Zoom username, in which he had labelled himself the “Handforth PC clerk”.Ms Weaver said: “The chairman simply declared himself ‘clerk’ and notified everybody of the case. There is no way of stopping him from calling himself clerk. Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on.”Those remaining voted to not allow the three men back into the meeting, with councillor Cynthia Samson likening one to a “laughing hyena”.The clips of the meeting were a hit with Twitter users, with more than 5,000 retweets and 32,000 likes. TV presenter Richard Osman tweeted: “Am busily writing Jackie Weaver into the next Thursday Murder Club novel.”Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Ms Weaver seemed to be enjoying her newfound fame, after her name was emblazoned on T-shirts saying “YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER”.She said she had been amused by some of the coverage of the meeting. “Clearly there’s amusement in the way somebody has just lost it,” she said. “It’s harsh to take some pleasure from that, but I’m afraid when you are being bullied, if you can see that the other person has lost it then there is the sense of ‘I did OK there because I managed to hold it together.’“There is an element of bullying and bad behaviour in local councils, and a lot of us are working very hard, and that includes central government, to try and do something about that.”She said at least 99.99 per cent of parish council meetings were not that exciting. “They are often less exciting than we might hope,” she said.But Mr Tolver was unrepentant, saying he had a “reason to be angry”. He told PA news agency that Ms Weaver “had no status to speak other than when invited”.He added: “I cannot think of any other council meeting anywhere, that was taken over by an unqualified member of the public like this.“Removing half the councillors from the meeting denied half of the voters of the village from being represented – it was an appalling attack on their democratic rights.”Normally sedate and well-mannered bodies, parish councils are the lowest tier of local government in England. They have few powers but can play an important role in providing representation and consultation with district and county councils in matters such as planning, environment and recreation.The extraordinary outbursts followed a series of complaints about the conduct of some councillors in the village and allegations of unlawful decisions that have resulted in expenditure of public funds, according to a notice posted on the council’s website by David Brown, director of governance and compliance at Cheshire district council.At the end of the meeting, the councillors debated whether a recording of their discussions should be released.

France condemned the move while Germany, Poland and Sweden said they could retaliate. “I take the floor to just congratulate Russia for this success, it’s good news for the whole mankind because it means we are going to have more tools to face the pandemic,” Mr Borrell said earlier in Moscow.“It will be good news because as you know we are facing a shortage of vaccines and if there is another course of supply, that is welcome,” he told reporters after Mr Navalny was  jailed for two years and eight months on fraud charges on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Mr Navalny was back in court on separate charges of defaming a Second World War veteran, which could see him jailed for an additional two years.The EU’s foreign affairs chief, who pressed ahead with the meeting despite misgivings from some EU member states was under pressure to at least meet Mr Navalny.There are international moves to impose sanctions on Russia for the jailing of Mr Navalny, which took place after he narrowly survived an August poisoning attempt at the hands of Russian officials. He was arrested on his return home from Germany after recovering.US President Joe Biden on Thursday said America will no longer be rolling over in the face of Russia\u0027s aggressive actions and his officials said they would take action over Mr Navalny.A former senior US national security official for Barack Obama, with links to Mr Biden\u0027s state department, told The Daily : The optics are not good to have the EU\u0027s high representative in Moscow as Navalny is in a glass cage.Bob Seely, Tory vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Russia, said: I don\u0027t know if this is a quid quo pro, but I do think it\u0027s surprisingly uncomfortable for a very senior EU leader to be going to Moscow the week of one of its most high profile show trials in the past 15 years.It is bizarre, but it is also not right. Yes the EU has messed up its vaccine policy but to eject your value system straight out of the window so quickly? It\u0027s pretty shocking.MEP Sandra Kalniete, a former Latvian foreign minister and EU commissioner, said Mr Borrell had “whitewashed Putin’s regime”.The EU already has sanctions in place against Moscow for the chemical weapons attack on Mr Navalny and the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.The Spanish diplomat’s embarrassment was compounded when Mr Lavrov accused the EU of being an “unreliable partner” for considering further sanctions.He suggested German Chancellor Angela Merkel was lying when she accused Vladimir Putin of being behind the assassination attempt.An EU diplomat told The , “It was a bad day for the EU. Unfortunately, it was not a good performance by Mr Borrell. He was unprepared.  Mr Lavrov played by his own rules and got everything he wanted.”Mr Borrell said he had told Mr Lavrov to release Mr Navalny and investigate his poisoning in August. Over the last years our relationship has been marked by fundamental differences and lack of trust, he said on the first visit to Russia by a senior envoy since 2017.Mr Lavrov criticised the EU for alleged human rights abuses in Latvia and said that Brussels and Moscow were united in their criticism of the US blockade of Cuba after Mr Borrell admitted the bloc was against the blockade.Mrs Merkel said Germany was prepared to continue sanctions and suggested Berlin would retaliate for the expulsion of its diplomat.She said it was a diplomatic duty to keep open channels of communication with Moscow in a press conference with Emmanuel Macron, who has also called for continued dialogue. With regards to the Navalny affair, I condemn with the greatest firmness from start to finish what has happened” Mr Macron said on Friday. Poland summoned Russia\u0027s ambassador and said it would take “appropriate action”. Sweden warned that it reserved the right to an appropriate response.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government has left britain mercy beijing time running","story":"In the end, it wasn’t the airing of forced confessions, or its manifest propaganda on Hong Kong that did for CGTN, the Chinese state broadcaster. It was the little matter of its licence ownership.Ofcom stripped CGTN of that license this week on the basis that the media outlet is a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), making it illegal for it to use a UK broadcast license. CGTN is still free to publish online, like anyone else, and it never had a vast UK television audience, but the significance of this move goes beyond that. For one thing, it shows one way in which our norms and rules are simply incompatible with many aspects of the Chinese system. More importantly, it illustrates yet again the need for a government-led strategy to defend our society from CCP interference, rather than continuing with the chaotic and dangerous approach of leaving our institutions and citizens to navigate this quagmire on their own.For now, it looks like we’re on our own. With clockwork predictability, Beijing has denounced Ofcom’s decision and threatened retaliation against the BBC. It’s not surprising if Xi Jinping finds the BBC’s recent China coverage inconvenient. The corporation’s reports in the past month alone include a damning investigation into forced labour in China’s cotton industry and new testimony by survivors of Beijing’s “re-education” camp system in the province of Xinjiang describing systematic rape and torture.What is bizarre about this diplomatic spat, however, is that it has been brought on not by a strategic government decision or even a ministerial gaffe, but simply by a regulator implementing the law. Even Ofcom was itself forced to act by an impeccably researched complaint, put in by a campaign group called Safeguard Defenders, which marshalled all the evidence showing CGTN’s true chain of command. Given the incredible persistence of delusions about Beijing in our civil service and No 10, I’m sure the whole thing is giving them night sweats.If they aren’t sweating, they should be. Again and again, ministers have to be cajoled into accepting the reality that the Sino-British “golden era” instigated by George Osborne is not just over – it never really existed. The Government’s reluctance to accept this truth is the direct cause of the rebellion it suffered recently in Parliament, in which a substantial chunk of its own backbenchers backed a move to link British trade policy to human rights. The wrangling over amendments is still ongoing.This isn’t a normal Tory approach to trade, but it underlines how widespread is the anxiety that, if his MPs allowed it, Boris Johnson would happily let Britain drift into an irreversible and catastrophic embrace with China. Describing the attitude setting in among MPs, one organiser puts it like this: “Until the UK changes its approach, every bill is a China bill.”Piecemeal policy won’t work, either. Take the example of the recent measures on Xinjiang announced with great fanfare by the Foreign Office. Dominic Raab stood up in Parliament and declared that British companies will now have to conduct “appropriate due diligence” on their supply chains to make sure they aren’t using forced labour. If it weren’t so disturbing it would be funny. The World Health Organisation can’t even get unfettered access to a seafood market. What chance does a British clothes retailer have of trundling into Xinjiang and asking its suppliers if they use slaves?What’s more, this is just the end of a very long string. Once you start tugging, anything could happen. Take, a recent report by a company called Horizon Advisory, which took a good, hard look at the Chinese supply chain for polysilicon, an essential material for making solar panels. It found that there is evidence of forced labour use by companies accounting for up to a third of the world’s supply. Maybe we can send in Extinction Rebellion to “due diligence” that one.The same sorts of problems are popping up all over the shop, whether it’s UK academics taking cash from Chinese defence conglomerates, local councils making planning decisions on Chinese nuclear plants or banks like HSBC freezing the assets of Hong Kong dissidents. No 10’s failure to devise a strategy that addresses these issues is fast turning from an embarrassment into a genuine threat to our security.There may be help on the way. This week, the US think tank Atlantic Council published a brilliant essay by an anonymous former government official laying out a detailed framework for how the US should approach China. While Donald Trump woke up Washington to the threat, he was incapable of the hard graft required to devise a strategy, forge bipartisan support and recruit allies. What’s needed, the essay argues, is something equivalent to the 1946 “Long Telegram” that laid out a long-term US strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union. If the US were to lead the way, our Government would surely follow.The key point the essay makes is that the West must develop an infinitely more sophisticated understanding of its own and China’s strengths and weaknesses and of Beijing’s complex internal politics. Following that, we need to agree on red lines and be prepared to defend them, as well as identifying major interests, areas ripe for competition or co-operation and plans for how to implement all of this. If we actually did this hard work, we would probably soon realise that our interests are obvious and easily agreed, and many of the remedies may become clear too.For example, it is broadly a good thing that thousands of Chinese students study at UK universities. It is also clearly a threat to our values if those students are segregated and subject to intense surveillance by Chinese government associations and if the fee income they generate is used to blackmail our universities into suppressing debate on Hong Kong. If the Government devised some policies on this, enforced them and educated universities on the dangers, rather than leaving vice-chancellors to stand or fall alone, Beijing would soon learn we are a society with rules, capable of defending itself.Ultimately, No 10 can choose to be dragged kicking and screaming into a chaotic new era, leaving Britain at the mercy of hostile forces, or it can admit we face a new challenge and get to grips with it. Mr Johnson might not like it, but the world has changed since he rode a Boris bike around Beijing to wild applause in 2012.

READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!”When councillor Susan Moore called for civility there were howls of laughter before Mr Brewerton was also removed.There were objections to them being allowed back in as Mr Brewerton’s companion was compared to a laughing hyena.The clip also showed discussion over Mr Tolver’s Zoom username in which he described himself as the “clerk”. Ms Weaver pointed out: “There is no way of stopping him from calling himself clerk. Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on.In a round of television and radio interviews on Friday, Ms Weaver said that if she had known she would be propelled to overnight fame then “I would have gone and got my hair done”.The 62-year-old pointed out that “99 percent of council meetings are not like that” but warned there is “bullying and bad behaviour in local councils”.If nothing else, what\u0027s happened over the last 24 hours has really shown that parish councils are there. It hasn\u0027t shown them in their best light, I get that, but we have got elections in May,” she told ITV.The Government seems absolutely committed to holding those elections. Get involved. If you don\u0027t think what you saw was right, get in there and change it. That\u0027s what I would like to see.There has long been disquiet at the council, and it is understood that the dispute stems from a councillor being expelled for non-attendance.Cllrs Tolver and Brewerton and a third member who was also chucked out of the meeting by Ms Weaver, Cllr Barry Birkhill, were all opposed to that expulsion, it is understood.A letter from the Cheshire East Council\u0027s monitoring officer on the council’s website, which is not dated, details multiple complaints about councillors behaviour”, allegations of unlawful conduct and misconceived and wholly inappropriate” claims that elections should not be held.  Cllr Tolver was on Friday night steadfast in his anger. In a statement, he said Ms Weaver\u0027s illegal behaviour caused the tensions to rise and said he had never seen a meeting “taken over by an unqualified member of the public like this”.He had been kicked out of an earlier meeting by Ms Weaver and claims her actions were an appalling attack on democratic rights.When Cllr Brewerton was contacted by The  a person understood to be a family member said that the police had been informed and “the truth will out”, but refused to elaborate.The minutes of the meeting and the declared interest of Cllr Brewerton were among the pages which had apparently been removed from the parish council website on Friday.But the anger from some at their new-found fame has not dampened their popularity. One of the councillors is understood to have agreed to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper.The video has now spawned tribute songs, “best of” compilations and even a mock-up documentary.Author and presenter Richard Osman said that he was “busily writing Jackie Weaver into the next Thursday Murder Club novel”.Mugs, t-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with quotes from the meeting and Ms Weavers face were selling online. Bookies were offering odds on her appearing on Strictly Come Dancing or I\u0027m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.A parody twitter account joked that Rosemary Shrager would play her in a biopic of her life whilst Dame Julie Walters and Paula Wilcox would play the other female councillors on the call.  Ms Shrager, the chef and TV presenter, responded: “Sign me up”.  It has also put Handforth on the map when the town’s “previous claim to fame was a big M\u0026ampS” neighbouring MP Lucy Powell joked.  But as the world eagerly awaits the adaptation one thing is for sure, the next meeting of Handforth Parish Council will be a sell out, with members of the public around the world already looking up ways they can join.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine seen gibraltar silent sub sniffer kit track","story":"Royal Navy submarines have been fitted with silent ‘sub sniffers’ which can be used to track Russians in the Mediterranean.HMS Talent, one of the Royal Navy’s Trafalgar-class attack submarines, was seen in Gibraltar on Tuesday sporting new equipment on her hull.Experts say the specialised systems are used to hunt other submarines without using sonar, which can easily be detected. The Mediterranean Sea, which can only be accessed through the narrow strait of Gibraltar,  is a body of water very familiar to the Royal Navy. It is an area Russian submarines are known to patrol, along with other Russian navy vessels supporting military action in Syria.As such it could be an ideal testing ground for British submarines fitted with new kit to hunt other submarines. The non-acoustic sensors can pick up tiny radiation signatures from the power plant of enemy submarines as well as small changes in water pressure caused by the passage of a submerged vessel.Richard Scott, naval consultant editor at Jane\u0027s, said: “The navy has had non-acoustic sensors - on trials and in service - for about three decades in different forms. Russian submarines in the Cold War were observed with a host of probes coming out of them and they were regarded as having a lead in non-acoustic technology.Soviet submarines tested many types of Wake Object Detection Systems (or ‘System Obnarujenia Kilvaternovo Sleda’ in Russian, and known as SOKS by Nato) from the late 1960s onward. Submarines are most easily located using sound, either coming from inside a hidden boat or ‘bounced’ off the metal hull from a vessel in pursuit. Omnidirectional receivers pick up these SOund Navigation And Ranging (sonar) emissions which are then analysed by highly trained operators.However, advances in submarine technology have made modern boats much quieter and operators have to contend with other underwater sounds such as marine life and even the movement of the water itself making passive systems less reliable. These competing noises are more pronounced in shallow water, such as the Meditteranean Sea and the coast around Britain.Active sonar, whereby a submarine emits noise in the form of a ‘ping’ which is then returned from the hull of a tracked vessel, will give away the presence and likely position of the hunter.   Pete Sandeman, a naval specialist, says experimentation with various non-acoustic methods for detecting submarines has been ongoing since the Cold War. These include sensors that can find tiny chemical or radiation signatures from anti-corrosive coatings flaking off the hull or byproducts from oxygen generation systems.“Wake-detection, that can sense tiny bubbles left behind in the water column by a submarine, appears the most promising line of development,” he told the .“The reason more non-acoustic systems are appearing on submarines now is likely to do with advances in computing and the need to find a new generation of very quiet submarines that are very hard to detect using passive sonar. “The data from the non-acoustic sensor may become much more valuable when processed using powerful artificial intelligence and possibly integrated with the conventional sonar picture,” he said.Control of noise is critical to a submarine’s ability to hide underwaterAll machinery is mounted on rubber and every effort is taken to prevent noise being transmitted to the hull. The main machinery - hundreds of tonnes of equipment - is mounted on a raft and isolated from the hull to keep it quiet. Submariners talk of ‘layers’ in the water, depending on temperature, salinity and distance from land. Sonar can often not penetrate these layers, meaning skilled commanders can use them better to hide their boats. It is thought wake detection systems can help build a picture of where the layers in the water are. A former submariner told the : “There are layers in the water, mainly temperature, although strong salinity layering does happen in places like the Amazon where it comes into the Atlantic. “There’s a real boundary where you move from salt water into fresh, but the main thing is temperature. If there’s a five degree drop across a very narrow piece of water, when sound propagates against that boundary it tends to bounce within that layer.“So if you’re in a layer and somebody has detected you, and you can move to a different layer so the sound is not being propagated, you can lose the detector. “Sound propagates massively in water and if you can get into those boundaries and use them you reduce your detectability.“It’s all about knowing what’s out there and using that to your advantage.”The latest Russian and Chinese submarines are understood to be causing concern in Nato circles, leading to a greater focus on sub-sea activity.The Russian Navy had SOKS fitted on their Sierra and Akula boats but the technology is very complex and it is difficult to achieve consistent results.Now however, with the proliferation of new Russian submarines, the need for something more than passive sonar has become urgent, which is one reason such systems are being looked at again.In 2019 US Navy Rear Admiral William Houston said the Ohio-class submarine USS Florida had deployed to the Meditteranean Sea “to counterbalance the Russian buildup in Syria,” according to The Drive.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside uks biggest food charity","story":"AdvertorialInside the UKs biggest food charity - which is keeping families fed across BritainBarclays has pledged support to the food redistribution charity FareShare as part of its £m COVID- Community Aid PackagemirrorShareByJemma PattonWilliam Ramsey:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB AdvertorialFareShare is the UK’s largest food redistribution charity One in five children in the UK are currently growing up in a household where food is scarce, and one in four parents skip meals due to lack of money.These stats are no surprise to Kylie Brackstone, Playground Manager at Somerstown Adventure Playground in Portsmouth, which is part of Portsmouth City Council’s Play Youth and Community Service . Before the Coronavirus lockdowns the playground had been feeding children and parents daily. “We’d always have the slow cooker going, especially in the winter, always a stew or a soup, remembers Kylie.Our approach is always very informal, easy access, the children and their parents would know they could help themselves whenever they liked. People then felt secure enough to kind of say ‘I’m struggling this month’ and we could put a little box together for them.”  Although PYC’s kitchens have had to close during lockdowns, they’ve been providing food parcels to families across Portsmouth.Holly Easlick, Health Development Officer for the council, tells us how FareShare – the UK’s largest food redistribution charity – helped: “During the first lockdown FareShare were able to deliver us more food than ever so we were able to get it out to the families who needed it. Kylie stresses how vital this contact with vulnerable families is: “With Covid-, the food was a big thing to help us continue our interaction with the families. Families that struggle with food provision, there are people truly in need.” She adds: “Itaposs also about that weekly interaction. A lot of our families struggle with mental health, so that idea that they knew they could come down every week and get a food package, and also see us, talk to us was one of the most important things.Even though it was just kind of over the gate, we were able to have a conversation and it was a way in to seethere were other ways they were struggling and we could support them.”  FareShare is a network of  independent organisations with more than  warehouses right across the UK. The charity takes food that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors, short shelf le or over production, and redistribute it through a network of , frontline organisations.The food FareShare redistributes is nourishing and fresh – the same as the food you’d eat at home. Homeless hostels, school breakfast clubs, domestic violence refuges, older people’s lunch clubs, food banks and hospices all depend on FareShare’s help. Ninety per cent of these charities have seen demand reach crisis levels since the pandemic started, and they’re preparing for even more people to find themselves in need this winter. Over the coming months, FareShare will also be delivering food to night shelters and school holiday projects to reach even more people who are struggling. This winter Barclays is working with FareShare to help raise vital funds. With approximately .m people in the UK currently living in food poverty, the amount of food that’s currently wasted is shocking. It’s estimated that a third of all food produced is wasted, at a cost of £b.  FareShare is committed to ensuring that food that would otherwise be wasted gets redistributed with frontline charities and community groups. Barclaysapos £m Covid- Community Aid Package was established to help charities continue to carry out the vital work they do. It’s pledging support to organisations that are helping people affected by the crisis. To support this peak in winter demand, Barclays is pledging to donate £ for every £ you donate to FareShare through the link or text number below, up to £m, until  February. FareShare is able to provide up to four meals with every £ donated – with Barclays your £ means up to  meals for those in need.So to help feed someone this winter, contribute via Barclays by going to fareshare.org.uk barclays or texting GIVE , GIVE  or GIVE  to .

Passengers coming into the UK will take both tests during their -day isolation period amid new quarantine measures starting February , reports the . It is also understood the extra rule will be imposed on arrivals from all countries and not just virus hotspots, according to the newspaper. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to announce the plans next week. The measure is aimed predominantly at ing Brits, with arrivals either having PCR kits posted to do at home or given details of their nearest testing centre.When you arrive into the UK you will have to take two tests during your ten-day isolation, a Government source told the Daily Mail. It will be a further level of protection. From the same date, hotel quarantine for travellers from  countries on the ‘red list’ will also be introduced.Theyaposre expected to be met at ports of entry and transported directly in special taxis or minibuses to their accommodation which they will have to pay for. People from red list countries, or anyone who has visited one in the last ten days, are already banned from entering the UK.  The scheme will be for UK residents and nationals “who cannot be refused entry.” Countries which introduced similar schemes have seen far fewer Covid cases. However, the delay in bringing in the measure in the UK is in part down to the Government identying buildings which fit specic requirements, including sufficient ventilation, sources told the Mail.  On January  the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned that reactive, geographically targeted travel bans would not be enough to stop the arrival of new Covid iants. This was because there is a lag between the emergence and detection of new iants so they could be present in countries not on the list. Sage said the only way to “get close” to preventing new strains was to introduce quarantine measures for all travellers entering Britain.

Johnson: Dearly Brexited, we are gathered here to consider the complete s***show of the past year and whoaposs to blame. Let me quote the standing orders. When in trouble, the Prime Minister may apportion blame to the Opposition. If that fails, blame the NHS. If that fails, blame the citizens of the UK.

In a speech last February you said coronavirus would trigger a panic beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage. As per standing order  of a sane and reasonable democracy, will you accept that you have taken more than a year to start being medically rational, and thereby have done real and unnecessary economic damage we could have bloody well avoided Johnson: MRS WEAVER PLEASE. You have no authority here, no authority at all! You are a mere female! Cromweaver: It is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place, which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue, and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew, and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches... Ye are grown intolerably odious to the whole nation you were deputed here by the people to get grievances redress’d... Turn off that shining screen, and lock up their iPads. In the name of God, go!

The fact there were no cobras at those meetings is irrelevant.Shapps: HEE HEEE HEE!Theresa May: New Prime Minister, welcome to the job and may I say how disrespectful it is for SOME PEOPLE to be laughing like hyenas while sitting in my seat  [shot of random head banging on desk]Gove: A STRONGLY-WORDED SUBPOENA!

Boris Johnson pledged to set out a roadmap on how Englandaposs national lockdown will be lted in the week of February , with officials expressing quiet confidence that the PMaposs mid-February target for vaccinating the  million most vulnerable people will be met. The Government revealed that it aims to vaccinate all the over s by early May, as it announced that local elections would go ahead on May . Mr Johnson has pointed to Easter as a point when lockdown restrictions would be substantially lted, saying it could be a very, very dferent world by then. But ministers are being cautious not to raise the hopes of the lockdown-weary public by setting dates, but some scientists have started predicting the path to freedom from restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock previously set four tests for lting lockdown measures. They are:Another major, new iant is not causing dficulties The vaccination rollout is working Hospitalisation numbers are reducing  The number of deaths are coming downThe Prime Minister is pinning his hopes on the continued success of the vaccine programme, but he warned on Wednesday that hospitalisations remain forbiddingly high. However he is under pressure from Tory MPs to lt restrictions as soon as possible - a clamour that is likely to grow in the coming days. Hereaposs what we know so far on how and when the restrictions could be lted. Plans are still being worked out, so we may not find out the full details until the Prime Minister sets out his roadmap later this month. Schools will be the first thing to open  The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that getting pupils back in the classroom is the first priority. March  has been pencilled in for the partial reopening of schools in England, with primary schools likely to be the first to . Pupils in exam years - year  and  - could also go back earlier, even though GCSEs and A-Levels have been scrapped this year. Parents and schools have been promised two weeks notice on when face-to-face teaching can resume.  The idea behind the March  date is it would allow a three-week window from the mid-February deadline for the top priority groups to get the jabs. This would give enough time for immunity to kick in for he most vulnerable. But Mr Johnson is facing pressure from his own MPs and teachers to open schools sooner, with growing calls for teachers to be vaccinated in the second phase of the rollout. Outdoor activities could follow  The next area where rules could be relaxed is outdoor exercise and socialising. People are currently barred from any outdoor meet-ups, except for exercise within their household or bubble, or with one other person. The PM is said to be considering letting team and inidual sports go ahead in the open air, where transmission of the virus is lower. Limited social gatherings outside could also be on the cards, the Times reported.  There could be ato limits on numbers of people who can meet up, similar to the rule of six last year, which allowed you to meet up to five others. Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert on the Govermentaposs modelling group, said the idea of ato outdoor activity was slightly concerning and urged caution. Pressed on whether outdoor socialising next month seemed reasonable, he said a little bit more mixing outdoors might be reasonable but would need very clear messaging from the Government. It is not clear when gyms and exercise classes would be able to resume. Non-essential shops may also start to open  Only essential shops, such as supermarkets, pharmacies and garden centres, have been allowed to stay open during the national lockdown. But it is likely that they will be among the next things to reopen when national restrictions begin to lt. Under the tiers system, non-essential shops were allowed to keep their doors open, with Covid safety measures, except in the toughest Tier  areas. It may depend whether the UK s to a tiered system or the whole country comes out of lockdown at the same time. Open air markets are likely to open before indoor shops. A Whitehall source recently told the : “We have to avoid the situation last time where theof schools meant far greater household mixing across the board. “So that means weaposd be likely to wait at least another month for non-essential retail, and a month beyond that at least for pubs and restaurants. This could mean that shops start to open again in early April, possibly after Easter Sunday on April . But pubs and restaurants are likely to stay closed for longer  Hospitality venues were among the last places to reopen after the first lockdown due to the risks of transmission of the virus. SAGE experts have pointed to May as a possible time for pubs and restaurants to reopen - which could coincide with the bank holiday weekend. If the Government meets its target to vaccinate the over s by early May, this could make it safer to open up hospitality. Even then, pubs and restaurants faced a number of restrictions on how they could operate. Allowing takeaway pints and food could be the first stage of easing restrictions, or allowing al fresco dining. The rules on household mingling will also be a factor, depending on whether you can socialise with friends or people you donapost live with indoors. Mr Johnson is believed to be keen to simply the rules, including scrapping the widely ridiculed requirement for people to have a substantial meal with their pints, which applied in some tiers.

Boris Johnson is said to be targeting early summer for boozers to allow punters back inside, while takeaway pints will be allowed in April, it has been claimed. However, groups will likely still be encouraged to use beer gardens as the weather brightens up, The Sun reports.It comes after the government was heavily criticised over complex rules last year, with pubs in many parts of the country only allowed to serve customers who bought a substantial meal. Downing Street estimations show half of all adults in Britain will have been vaccinated by May and  million over s and the vulnerable by the end of April. The British Beer  Pub Association claims  million pints of beer have been wasted since the pandemic started, setting the industry back £ million. Whitehall sources told the Sun the plans were in early days.

Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and others are said to be concerned that alcohol hinders the possibility of effective social distancing.

Ministers are discussing extending the school day so that children who have missed out on vital teaching during lockdown can be put up to speed. The Prime minister is being pressed to consider after-school classes that would be run by volunteers, according to The Sun. Education Committee chair Robert Halfon told the paper that ministers were discussing the idea. He said: “We should extend the school day but not necessarily ask teachers to do it. “It could be funded by the catch-up programme and use civil society groups to provide sports or other support. “It would hugely improve the mental health of children — they’ve been locked up so long.” The Tory MP is also calling for education professionals to be drafted in to help kids catch up. Summer holidays are also being targeted as an area which could be changed but this is said to be less likely. Last summer, some catch-up school programmes were put up to help kids who fell behind using the governmentaposs £billion Covid catch-up fund. This was recently extended with another £million and a national tutoring programme. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its plans on easing lockdown later this month. Boris Johnson pledged to set out a roadmap on how Englandaposs national lockdown will be lted in the week of February , with officials expressing quiet confidence that the PMaposs mid-February target for vaccinating the  million most vulnerable people will be met.The Government revealed that it aims to vaccinate all the over s by early May, as it announced that local elections would go ahead on May .

In a damning new report, Anne Longfield warned of “missed opportunities” to protect vulnerable young people, with , children - one in  of English teenagers – already falling through gaps in education and social care. Vulnerable children are harder to identy due to the pandemic – with a % drop in referrals to children’s services in November. And with schools closed, bored and lonely children are “increasingly at risk in parks and takeaways, with predators waiting to pounce”, she said.  The majority of councils are failing to get a grip on the problem, with more than seven in councils failing to quanty youth violence in their area, the report found. Only  in  local authorities tracked risk factors linked with exploitation – such as school exclusion, going missing, drug and alcohol abuse or living with a family member convicted of an office.  The vast majority of councilsran drug awareness courses, but only halfreported having a public health drug policy for children and young people.  Ms Longfield said: “Predators who seek to exploit children for financial gain will use sophisticated methods to target, groom and coerce children.   “They are ruthless in their efforts to keep children in their thrall, subjecting them to unspeakable abuse, threats and intimidation. “If intervention comes when children are already entangled in these dangerous enterprises, it is dficult to reach them.” She added: “Tragically, until there is this joined up public health response to gangs that identies and helps all those children at risk as early as possible, teenagers will keep dying on our streets.”"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine visas could allow brits","story":"NewsVaccine visas could allow lockdown weary Brits to travel abroad this summerMinisters and government officials have spent weeks denying plans are being drawn up for documents showing who has been inoculated and allowing them to travel abroadmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video tories-vaccine-passports-other-countires-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Ministers and government officials have spent weeks denying plans are being drawn up for documents showing who has been inoculated and allowing them to travel abroad. But today it was reported a certication system is being worked on. Tourism chiefs in Greece said UK holidaymakers could be welcomed to its hotspots later this year. Greek Hoteliersapos Federation President Grigoris Tasios told the Times: Greece has long been a favourite holiday destination for the British. “But with the rate of inoculations in the UK largely outpacing all others across Europe and beyond, British travellers will be among the safest to travel here by as early as May. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said it would be up to countries where holidaymakers were arriving to decide on travel passports. It is often the case that the entry requirements for countries are for vaccines or inoculations, and that is not an uncommon practice,” he told the BBC. We will work with international partners to help facilitate their border arrangements and their immigration arrangements.He added: “The decisions that inidual countries make about their own incoming arrangements is obviously up to them. We are incredibly proud of the speed and the breadth of our vaccination rollout and of course, I think the whole world hopes, that the vaccination programme will be a way of getting back to normality. Travel industry chiefs welcomed the possibility of vaccine visas allowing tourists to head for foreign beaches. An Association of British Travel Agents spokeswoman said: “It is sensible to have the option of some sort of proof of vaccination, because that evidence, alongside testing, is likely to be part of the way to re-opening travel. “Waiting for the full rollout of the vaccination programme to be completed in the UK before people start to travel overseas would mean another summer season lost to the pandemic.“We need a reopening strategy that keeps up with the developing medical situation and with medical understanding, as well as recognising other countries may have dfering policies on how and when they accept vaccinated travellers.” A TUI spokeswoman said: “We welcome any effort to simply the process of travel and enable more people to travel again safely.” Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said Labour “will look at proposals around helping to allow people to travel safely, but this must be led by the science”. A No  spokesman confirmed the issue of vaccine passports was being kept under review.  He added: There are still no current plans to roll out vaccine passports. “Going on holiday is currently illegal. We have always been clear that we will keep the situation under review.” An EasyJet spokeswoman said: “We want to work with Government to put in place a roadmap of how to progressively and safely unwind restrictions.We know that people want to travel this summer, when it is safe to do so, and so while some restrictions remain in place, vaccine passports could play a part in enabling more people to travel again to countries requiring proof of vaccination. It is critical that this is implemented in a simple way to ensure it is easy for passengers.” Oxford jab is equally good on UK iant The Oxford vaccine is as effective at fighting the more contagious UK iant as the original virus. Findings by the Oxford Vaccines Group offer hope that vaccinations will rapidly reduce cases. The vaccine, estimated to be “high % or %” effective, also prevented severe disease.  Data from  trial participants who tested positive from October to January  was analysed. Although those with the Kent iant had fewer antibodies, Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said: “The findings are very reassuring.” Meanwhile the Government has announced a deal with the firm CureVac to reformulate vaccines against emerging iants. It comes as public health officials try to stop new mutations getting out of control in northern England.

Researchers at Warwick University used simulations to model what could happenBritain is unshackled in the coming months, before presenting their findings to SAGE. The paper, published on Friday, said despite nearly  million people across the UK having so far been inoculated, the unprecedented roll-out is insufficient to allow for ato normal before the end of the year. The scientists warn such a move could be catastrophic and leading to thousands more hospitalisations and deaths. Have you been affected by Covid  Let us know in the comments This is because there will still be a substantial amount of people who refuse or cannot have the vaccine, meaning transmissions could quickly soar. While none of the jabs give complete coverage against the virus. The paper saysthe R rate were to remain at . and three million doses were being given each week and  per cent of those invited for a jab accepted, another wave could still hit before winter this year.If the Rule of Six, social distancing and face masks in shops and public transport, as well as a curfew were in place, from September, another wave could be avoided, it adds. Downing Streetaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies was presented with the findings on January . The document said: With the new aggressive Covid strain, likely transmission efficacies prove insufficient to prevent further infection outbreaks across the population. This means that the proportion of iniduals that do not accept the vaccine together with the proportion for whom it is ineffective in protecting, may still account for signicant further severe disease even after the program is completed. We see that even with the highest possible uptake and fastest vaccination program, full relaxation by the time schoolsin September would still result in signicant further disease.

Chris Irvine, , from outside Larne, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, is hoping to pay off his mortgage so he can leave the house to four-year-old Naomi. In less than  hours, a fundraising page set up by sister Heather White has raised more than £,, leaving Chris gobsmacked.Mum-of-one Heather, , told BelfastLive she wanted to do what she could to make her dying younger brotheraposs dream come true.It is unbelievable, I had put it up in the frame of mind that anything would help, she said.

In the first couple of hours it went to a grand then two, then three, I just thought it was unbelievable how generous people were and how touched they were.

Heather admitted her brother, a former Carrick College student, was not in a great place but seeing how much buzz and chit chat has come from the fundraiser his spirits have been raised.  He was thinking about not seeing Naomi going to school, it was heartbreaking, continued the mum of Poppy, aged three. Heather said Naomi is her brotheraposs whole world and said his face when he sees her is unreal. Since she was born all he talks about is Naomi, he is devastated, she added. His daughter was Chrisapos first thought on being diagnosed in  and he worried he wouldnapost be there for her, including missing her wedding and seeing her have kids of her own.  Doing all those little things that he wonapost see, Heather said. Speaking from hospital, former loss prevention officer for Next, Chris said he is desperate to avoid seeing his daughter having to go through the nightmare of renting. It would mean the world to leave something for my daughter as I have fought for my entire le to rise above that mediocrity of renting and getting to that stage of mortgage, which in todayaposs day and age is a nightmare, especially with the current climate of Covid etc, he said.  It would be amazing to leave Naomi with something for the future to build on, especially with it being her first home. The generosity of people has been amazing, I canapost thank people enough, every little bit helps towards the cause, I never thought it would reach such a figure as it has, he added. Sadly, Chris and Heather lost their mum Gillian Naomi Irvine less than three years ago to cancer at the age of . She was first diagnosed in  with cervical cancer after missing a smear test - with the news coming just three months after the death of Heather and brother Samuelaposs dad following a coronary attack. Chris had been feeling run down when his sister chased him down to the GP on his birthday on May ,  after he started vomiting constantly. After an ultrasound that July, it was revealed he had a large mass on his liver before further tests showed it was the rare fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. It had spread to his lymph nodes which ruled out surgery but he started chemotherapy and was  rounds in when Covid struck last March. The oncologist said donapost be alarmed but we donapost usually see people with your type of cancer, as in they are gone before they even realise they have it, said Heather. Given that it is so rare they donapost have that much research or trails or anything to go with. Chris was admitted to hospital numerous times for infections which stopped the chemotherapy. He started to experience a lot of discomfort and a scan in November  showed the disease had spread to bones in his spine and he had a large fracture causing the pain. Then eight days after his daughteraposs birthday in December he had another scan, this time indicating more spread to the lower and upper part of the spine.

Lauren Ham, from South Wales, desperately wanted to give the tired looking bathroom an overhaul in the new family home she shares with husband David and stepdaughter Ella. But when a professional quoted her £, for a full bathroom re-fit, she decided to do it herself and it cost her just £. The DIY novice, who works as a case management assistant, used supplies from Argos, BQ and Dunelm for the impressive transformation.Lauren, told money-saving community LatestDeals : We moved into our home at the end of August this year in what was the dreariest wettest day in history, or so it felt.It was a very long and stressful process from offer accepted to moving in day, further exacerbated by the restrictions of a national lockdown and the delays moving within a chain can bring. We first saw the house back in March and instantly fell in love. This house is just perfect for us and ticked all of the boxes we had in mind for our dream home together. We have been married three years but this was to be our first and forever home. Despite the property being perfect for the familyaposs needs the couple compromised on one thing - the tiny bathroom. Itaposs a spacious three-bed, three-storey townhouse with a generous sized garden, Lauren said. The only thing that we compromised on was the size of the bathroom which was just over .m by .m. We are fortunate to have a little en suite too, but the bathroom is my sanctuary and I knew I’d struggle with a small one with no natural light. It’s situated right next to the airing cupboard which contains the hot water tank so it gets extremely warm in there. We’d had a few quotes for work which were fairly reasonable, but after spending much more than we had intended on other jobs in the home we just didn’t have the budget left. I accepted it was dropping down the list of priorities and would be something we’d tackle next year. But Lauren soon started on remodelling the bathroom herself using months worth of plans sheaposd drawn up and a colour scheme sheaposd spotted online. For this bathroom, I wanted the tiles to be light and fresh to complement the blue, and chose a pale metallic effect vinyl tile to bounce the light from the spots around the walls, she said. For me, the colour palette elegantly reflected the traditional basin and bath taps. The original suite was in perfect condition and we absolutely loved the traditional features. We only had to change the taps on the basin as the old ones had stopped working when we moved in. I remembered years ago seeing a full wall mirror in a show home bathroom and loved how effective it was. “Having no window here was the perfect opportunity to try it and we are thrilled with the illusion of light and space it offers the room now.  When Lauren pulled up the lino to see what was underneath the job became more demanding. She said: Having no intention to do anything this side of Christmas with the bathroom, the one evening last week I decided to pull up the lino to see what was underneath out of interest. That was my mistake because once I’d done that there was no way it was going back down. Over a period of five days, we stripped the floor, sanded it back and primed it. “We stripped the sealant from the bath using a Stanley kne and white spirit and an awful lot of elbow grease. This was probably the hardest part and something I wouldn’t do myself again in a hurry. It was inches deep under the base of the tiles and back-breaking work. I have to admit, I did cry and wish I’d never started! Once this prep was done I spent some time researching tile paint. I was conscious I’d read so many horror stories and seen countless pictures of tile painting gone wrong, but with the best reviews and lots of handy tips, I settled on this brand and had nothing to lose, or basically no other choice by this point! I scrubbed the tiles with sugar soap, any bumps were sanded back with soft grit sandpaper and we got to work with a foam roller using V Satin White Tile Paint from BQ.  You need to leave exactly six hours between coats, which when you’re impatient, is quite the task. My husband took coat two as I couldn’t summon the wherewithal, and we closed the door on it until the morning. The result was outstanding. This paint dries brilliantly. The coverage was excellent after two coats but we decided on a third to ensure it would be long-lasting. Lauren explained how she managed to keep the cost of creating her dream bathroom space right down. As complete DIY novices working full time we had some help from some very trusted tradespeople to complete some of the other tasks above our skill set, she said. We were originally quoted approximately £, for a re-tile and floor with sealing the bath and sink. The cost to transform the bathroom recently came in at just over £ for paint, flooring, wall art, help from trades for the work we couldn’t do and the large mirror. The bath shelf and bath tray were £ and £, the white soap dispenser was £ and the soap dish was £, all from Dunelm. I bought these before we moved at the beginning of the year as I had this vision that I wanted to create when we could afford it. They do still stock these now.  I feel the wood tones complement the light design and soften the room. The small mirror above the sink was £ from Argos along with the under-sink cabinet which was £, Lauren added. The large mirror we measured and was custom-made by a local glass supplier for £ and delivered for no charge. We fitted it ourselves using mirror adhesive. It dries within  minutes. “The blush towels and flannels we already owned from ASDA, the wall prints were £ for three from Etsy, the wooden frames were £ each from the Frame Company and the green reusable bottles were £. for two from ebay. “The floor was primed underneath with Zinsser BIN Multi-Surface Matt Primer. No underlay was required as the floorboards were chipboard and in perfect condition. We still have most of the tin left, this stuff is wonderful! I’ll be priming everything in future. “The peel and stick vinyl floor tiles were £. a pack from BQ. The wall paint was Dulux Denim Drt Bathroom, and was mixed by Valspar as our local BQ were out of the original brand . It cost £ for one litre. “The woodwork paint cost £ for two litres and was Dulux One Coat Satin White. “The tile paint was V Satin White wall tile and ling paint from BQ, applied with a small foam roller. We used three light coats with six hours of drying time between coats. It cost £ for two litres.”  Lauren is delighted with the finished project which has saved her more than £,. We are thrilled with the final result,” she said. It’s a room we stop to look in every time we walk past. Although small, it feels calming, light and fresh. I love the warmth that wooden accessories lend, I’m a nature girl at heart and love bringing it into my home. All in all our bathroom renovation came in at just over £ for labour, materials and accessories. I think these DIY projects during a time of worldwide pandemic are a tonic for the soul. My husband and I have been fortunate to continue to work mostly throughout but not without financial burdens as le has changed for us all. Lauren has some sage advice for those hoping to undertake a home improvement project of their own.

The Plas Panteidal residential and holiday estate in Gwynedd, North Wales, was once a thriving and absolutely lovely place on the banks of the Dyfi estuary. But now the water supply is contaminated with E coli and unfit for drinking, trees are in danger of falling onto homes, the electricity grid is close to collapse, the access road is marred with potholes and unfit for vehicles, and raw sewage once flowed down a hillside. On top of all of this, the  permanent residents who refuse to leave have to make a six-mile round trip for water or find it by other means - one even collects it from his roof gutter to drink, NorthWalesLive reports. Despite being asked to pay £-a-year in maintenance fees, everyone is forced to shower using spring water tainted by sheep and cattle muck from a muddy farm field. Do you have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror. For the past decade they have been travelling three miles to nearby Aberdyfi and back to stock up on bottles of water. The estate’s water supply originates from a mountain spring below an excrement-covered farm field. The siteaposs faulty sewage treatment plant was fixed after human waste seeped down a hillside, across a road and into the Dyfi estuary, but even now its aeration pumps are not working. Couriers refuse to deliver to the site due to potholes and rubble along the steep and windy access road.Locals are so desperate for proper amenities they are willing to fork out more than £ million of their own money to fix the problems. Some have formed the Plas Panteidal Associationand offered to create a not-for-profit management company to take over the running of the estate after Trehaven Leisure Ltd went into voluntary liquidation last year. The group submitted a bid for £ to liquidators KJ Watkin  Co. Brian Kelly, an Aberdyfi community councillor, said: “When I first moved here  years ago it was an absolutely lovely place to live with a growing and thriving community. “It now looks run down, the utilities are falling into dereliction and people here are getting desperate. “Our biggest worry is  Covid reaches us and we have to self isolate – it will make fetching water very dficult. “We would have to rely on neighbours bringing it to us – or even having to mail order it to the estate.” He said the water supply was confirmed to be contaminated with E coli and cryptosporidium, a parasite which can respiratory and gastrointestinal illness. For much of the past decade public health officials at Gwynedd Council have decreed no one on the estate should use the water for drinking, for brushing teeth, preparing food or cleaning open wounds. Instead the water is used only for showers and flushing toilets.  “The “not fit for consumption or food preparation” notice has now been in place for more than five years.” Retired couple Larry and Jane Simpkin moved to the estate in  in blissful ignorance, but they soon had neighbours banging on their door telling them not to drink the tap water. Larry, a former advanced medical technician with the NHS, and Jane, a former NHS receptionist and health care worker, have had sleepless nights and bouts of anxiety. They make the long trip to get water once a week, filling up seven five-litre bottles every time.Describing the process as degrading, Larry, , said: “People walk past as we’re refilling the bottles.  “They give you a look asto say, aposwhat on earth are you doing apos It’s a very strange feeling. “Sometimes I feel as though we’re living in a third world country. It’s like those adverts you see on TV with charities asking for donations for drinking water projects in African villages: while I realise we’re much better off than them, we have been fetching water for years and we are supposed to be living in a civilised country. “We are like a forgotten community – no one wants to put it right.” John Starbuck has a collection of almost  two-litre bottles neatly stacked on shelves in his bedroom.  The -year-old, who is a lab technician at the local high school, said: “It takes me an hour or two to take them to my friend’s house, fill them up and re-stack them in the bedroom. “I don’t ever regret buying a home here – it is a lovely place to live. I just wish the problems could be sorted. I don’t understand how things were allowed to get to this stage, how we as a community have been allowed to slip through the legislative cracks.” He claims the local electricity grid is close to failure. Wooden junction boxes are rotting away, wires are running through branches and live cables have been exposed to the elements. Plas Panteidal has  properties. Of those, about three quarters are privately owned. Until September last year, the rest belonged to Trehaven Leisure, which has run the site for  years. It went into voluntary liquidation last summer.  About two thirds of the housing stock are holiday lets or kept as second homes, leaving  permanent residents living in about  homes. For about  years private homeowners have battled to force Trehaven Leisure Ltd to upgrade the site’s amenities. Despite being asked to pay £-a-year in maintenance fees, they endured conditions that one holiday review site described as a “reminiscent of a building site” with an “overpowering smell of animals”. Any new owner will have to take on six public health charges issued by Gwynedd Council for breaches in water supply regulations. A further three charges have been levied by Natural Resources Wales for unauthorised discharges from the sewerage treatment plant.  There are more than £, of unpaid electricity bills owed to Scottish Power and at least £, in legal costs. Thataposs before the £. million remedial costs are factored in for new water and sewerage plants, new water storage tanks and an upgraded access road. Cllr Kelly, who chairs the PPA, said: “That doesn’t make it look like an attractive proposition to any buyer. Except of course to the residents with their vested interest in living there safely.” Much to the amazement of residents, other “interested parties” are said to be in the mix to acquire the site. Specialists hired by the PPA to assess the work that needed doing refused to inspect the site’s metal water storage tanks as they were too rusty, liable to collapse and simply too dangerous.  Council officers, MPs and Senedd Members have all visited the site but the impasse remains. Philip Muddiman, director of Trehaven Leisure until it was dissolved, blamed a small cabal of residents for spreading discord, accusing two-thirds of not paying site maintenance fees for at least five years. Instead they have been redirecting fees to a holding fund held by their solicitors for future use, claiming services were being neglected. Mr Muddiman said he felt “sorry” for those residents who carried on paying their fees. He said: “They are up the creek without a paddle at the moment.

Lucci Smith, , who could have spared her son pain and suffering but not saved his le, was handed a two-year community order for cruelty to a child. She was out on the school run when her boyfriend lost his temper with the infant and attacked him, Cambridge Crown Court heard, reports CambridgeshireLive. Mitchell was also handed a -year concurrent sentence for cruelty or allowing serious physical harm to a child - with  days taken off his sentence for time served.  Teddie was just  weeks old when he was assaulted by Kane Mitchell on November , , in St Neots. Mitchell was not the baby boyaposs biological father but had been living with his mother, Lucci Smith, and her other children in the family home. While Smith was out on the school run, Mitchell had a sudden temper and frustration with Teddie causing the baby boyaposs fatal injuries.During the pairaposs sentencing at  Cambridge Crown Court  today, February , Mr Justice Knowles acknowledged that while Mitchell did not intend to kill Teddie, there was nonetheless an intention to cause really serious harm. Teddie, who was born August   died in hospital  days after sustaining the fatal injuries. Mr Knowles summarised the injuries in his sentencing, explaining that there had been a previous assault by Mitchell. He said: Teddie on that occasion received a fracture to his right clavicle and fractures to two left ribs.  On November , by then  weeks old, Teddie received  rib fractures, a fracture to his left clavicle, fatal skull fractures, brain, spinal, and eye injuries. The rib and clavicle fractures were caused by Mr Mitchell grabbing Teddie and squeezing him with so much force that the ribs and clavicle went beyond their natural pliability to the point of fracturing. The fatal injuries to the head involved the violent striking by Mr Mitchell of Teddieaposs head against a hard or unyielding surface. The fatal assault took place while Smith was out, taking her other children to school. After she ed it became clear to her throughout the course of the morning and early afternoon that something was wrong with her baby.  However,  was not called until pm that day. Mr Knowles outlined how by .pm Smith was expressing the opinion to her mother that aposTeddieaposs really illapos. She then called the GP at around .pm, where it was made clear to her that she needed to call  urgently. However, Mr Knowles explained: Even then she delayed doing that until she had been to the school and collected her other children. On theirto the flat at  oaposclock, Teddie had stopped breathing.  was then called. Mr Knowles went on to say: Teddieaposs injuries and suffering were as a direct result of the actions of Mr Mitchell about which, in the light of the juryaposs verdict, Miss Smith was unaware and had no foresight of. Her failure to obtain earlier medical help could not have saved Teddie. It could have spared him some pain and suffering. Evidence from the trial showed that Smith did care about her childrenaposs wellbeing and loved them explained Mr Knowles, and she was capable of being highly competent when it came to their physical care. But, he continued, there were nonetheless times, and this offence is one of the results, where she did not stand up for the children because of what she wanted from her relationship with Mr Mitchell. In its own way, that failure accounts for her delaying on November  and allowing Mr Mitchell to deflect her actions and any attempt on her part to focus on Teddieaposs needs. At the same time, the situation on November  was serious. It was obvious to her that something was seriously wrong, and like no other occasion it required the action and focus she was capable of giving.

The then-Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya with Prince Philip and a team of staff at the time, and her husband had the heartbreaking job of giving her the news. Not only did the young princess have to come to terms with losing her dad, she also had to take in the fact that she was now the Monarch - something that would completely change every aspect of her le. But moments after being given the le-changing news, the future Queen walked over to staff and apologised to them. Recalling the heartbreaking day on February  , Elizabeth’s lady-in-waiting Pamela Mountbatten says her boss was completely calm. The royal couple and their staff were in Kenya at the time, but the unexpected tragedy meant the Princess had tohome immediately to take care of arrangements and start her role as monarch. Writing in her memoirs Daughter Of Empire, she says: She remained completely calm and said simply: aposI am so sorry. This means we all have to go home.apos  The team set to work planning their hasty journey back to Britain on the royal BOAC Argonaut, which had to be delayed for several hours because of a storm. Ever aware of her public duty, Elizabeth immediately discussed the practicalities of herto England. But she also asked for an hour alone in her room.

The pavements outside Victoria station and Westminster Cathedral were hotspots for homeless people just  months ago - due to the constant stream of pedestrians. But for the likes of Rorey Ennis, who canapost be trusted in hostels, it means loneliness and little chance of food or spare change. The -year-old, originally from Birmingham, said he survives day-to-day, reports MyLondon. Sat in front of a Pret a Manger beside Victoria’s main entrance on what in normal times would have been a busy Wednesday afternoon , Rorey explains this part of London is now eerily sparse. Are you homeless and sleeping rough  Contact us at webnews@mirror   It is more lonely than it used to be, he says. You spend days waiting to speak to someone. Originally from Birmingham, Mr Ennis has been sleeping rough since I was  years old, and has been in London for four years. I mostly hang around Victoria and Westminster and stayed here through all the lockdowns, he explains.  I usually sleep in my mate’s tent by the cathedral. There are hostels, but I don’t go to them, I can’t be trusted in a property. I’m surviving by just doing it day by day. Sometimes people will pop into Pret to get you something. At .pm over in Piccadilly Circus, a rough sleeper who asks not to be named says he arrived in London from Cardf two weeks ago. “I don’t get any benefits, says the -year-old. I rely on getting my food and money from donations. Today I’ve had a panini and a sausage roll and two coffees. I go to public toilets when I can, but they close at night. Like Mr Ennis, he says there are not many rough sleepers around Piccadilly Circus – an area where heavy footfall once made it an attractive location to pick up donations from passers by.  He continues: There have been outreach people and that’s it… They tell you where to go for housing or where to get food and a tent or clothes. I keep myself to myself and I sometimes see more rough sleepers around Charing Cross station. At night time I’m mostly outside. Since I’ve been in London I’ve been able to sleep in a hostel twice. They’re often full. Asked whether he’s felt scared of catching Covid-, he simply replies: F*** the pandemic.  At about .pm, Boyd Seagal is waiting in The Strand with a dozen other homeless people, including his partner, for a group of volunteers to arrive who will set up tables and lay out free food. The -year-old says: My partner and I have been homeless together in London for about a year. I have moved around a lot but I have been homeless at dferent stages since I was six years old. I left London and carried on to Mansfield and Nottingham and then Chesterfield, Derbyshire and Scotland. Mr Seagal suggests an answer as to why the capital’s historic centre appears to have fewer rough sleepers than might have been expected. Recently my partner and I have been coming to Charing Cross every day, he said. We walk from Wandsworth and all the way back. We have been put in separate rooms in a hostel in Wandsworth for  days. We started there two weeks ago. You get showers and bits and pieces and a chance to do your washing. A study by the charity St Mungo’s and the Greater London Authority shows that the number of people sleeping rough in the borough of Westminster fell markedly between July to September and October to December. The number of rough sleepers counted by outreach workers during the last quarter of the year was , which was  fewer than the previous quarter. This figure was also lower than when the same study was carried out in October to December  - when  rough sleepers were spotted. Petra Salva, from St Mungo’s, said: Since March, our teams in Westminster – in partnership with the local council - have been working round the clock to make sure as many people as possible are provided with accommodation so they are protected from Covid- as well as the other risks associated with being street homeless. And we know from [the data] that a signicant reduction in the number of people sleeping rough in Westminster has been achieved. However, this is not a static issue and there are people still coming to the streets who need and deserve immediate protection and long-term support. Westminster Council currently has more than  supported accommodation beds in use for homeless people, and a further  beds in two assessment centres. The council says it has helped  people into accommodation since March . Councillor Heather Acton, cabinet member for communities, said: Our outreach teams continued to work day and night over the Christmas period and will do so over cold winter spells. They will provide essential support tailored to each inidual finding themselves living on the streets in Westminster. Not only will this help them to access safe accommodation, but also essential mental health, drug and alcohol addiction services, work skills training and ultimately employment. Thus breaking the cycle of rough sleeping, offering long-term solutions rather than quick fixes.

The sheet was discovered by Rosa Beckerton’s husband Peter, , while he was refurbishing an old piece of furniture for a client. It is dated February , , and appears to be written by an -year-old girl imagining the state of the world in . She correctly predicts a huge sht in technology and even forecasts the Zoom revolution. Describing her husband’shome from work she writes: “’Hello dear,’ he said to me. ‘I’ve just got to ring up my friend on the telephone’.What do you think about the schoolgirlaposs predictions  Let us know in the comments“’Well you’d better tidy yourself up a bit,’ I said. “In  the telephone was a square box thing with a resiver [sic] on top of it. “But now it is still a resiver [sic], but you can see the people you are talking to, for there is a screen where you can see the people. It is a bit like a television.” Upholsterer Peter found the note stuffed down the back of a sofa which was sent to him for restoration after being bought second-hand.  Rosa, , from Peterborough, Cambs., decided to make the it public in case the author, who would now be aged around , is still alive. She said: “When my husband showed it to me I couldn’t believe it. I thought oh my god, look at this. “It was just so interesting, because looking at it today she’s got a lot of her predictions kind of right - but in her childish innocent way she thought it would all happen in ten years.  “I just wanted to share it in the hopes that maybe the author might see it and recognise it. “My husband has found all sorts of rubbish down the side of sofas and furniture before - but never anything as interesting as this.” The letter is unnamed but comes complete with a teacher’s corrections and comments in red pen - including the verdict ‘Good’.  It begins: “The year is , the time is half-past moon dust. Here I am twenty-one years of age, sitting in a cushion of air. “I remember when I was  years old and I was at school, things have changed since then. “For instance, the television has changed. “In  it was a square box with knobs in front of it. Now it is a big screen with knobs on your chair arm to switch it on and off.” The schoolgirl imagines that she is a married bank worker. She says in times past she would have “prepared tea” ready for her husband to come home. But she adds: “All we have is a piece of chewing gum to eat. You may think that we have not enough to eat but you are wrong, because this piece of chewing gum is food.

Themba Cabeka experienced temperatures of -C and fell partially unconscious due to lack of oxygen during the harrowing , mile trip from Johannesburg, South Africa. The -year-old stowaway was almost killed himself after being thrown on the London airportaposs runaway on landing - resulting in his leg having to be amputated. He was then placed in a coma for six months, reports MyLondon. You can donate to help Themba at his GoFundMe page here. Themba fled crime-ridden Johannesburg in June  along with friend Carlito Vale, dreaming of a better le after sleeping rough for five years. Neither could afford to pay for a flight of visa to the UK and after reading up on aeroplane design, Themba decided the best place to hide would be the space around the wheels. The pair jumped over a fence at the airport and climbed into the wheel compartment of a plane being prepped for flight.Once inside they were left clinging onto two metal bars inside the cavity.  I was not afraid of falling, because I had faith, said Themba. During the flight, the metal bars became so searingly hot he was left with permanent burns. But in the other extreme, as temperatures plummeted, he only had two pairs of jeans and three jackets to keep him warm. Once the wheel compartments had closed, both stowaways found themselves in pitch black darkness for hours, with the deafening noise of engines to listen to, but Themba said he remained relaxed.  I fell asleep because of the lack of oxygen, that’s why I didn’t see my friend when he fell out, he said.Carlitoaposs body was found on a roof below the Heathrow flight path. Recalling their last conversation, Themba said: Carlito said ‘we made it’. I said ‘Of course we made it, man.apos Those were the last words I heard from him, because I passed out. He admitted he thinks about their last conversation daily, and that he struggles to look in the mirror as a result.  Unfortunately, he’s not here, so I’m by myself now. They still haunt me but I have to keep on going. Every time I face the mirror it feels like I’m missing something. Everything is dferent, this isn’t the way it was supposed to go, I think about him so much. Themba only woke up when his body bounced off the tarmac, having fallen out just before the plane reached the runway. I fell out onto the runway and my leg snapped, he said. Lying on the floor, broken and barely conscious, Themba was then apprehended. He said: “I woke up and all I saw was two people shouting ‘He jumped out of the plane!’. They came and arrested me, and took me to the hospital. And from there, because of the lack of oxygen and cold from the flight, I passed out in a coma for six months. A short while after waking up from the coma, he was detained at the immigration detention centre for another six months.  And despite his perilous journey, he was denied asylum but was granted right to remain. He spent a night sleeping rough on the capital’s streets, before staying at a homeless shelter in Elephant and Castle. He was then moved to Liverpool, but claims there were drink and drug paraphernalia everywhere and so he fled and roamed the streets again.Gabriel Frood, , from Crystal Palace, who was studying in Liverpool at the time, saw him sitting in the cold, and stopped for a conversation. He took Themba in and set up a GoFundMe, which has already raised £, of a £, target. Themba insists that despite the trauma, his journey was worth it, but he wouldn’t repeat his trip.

The man, who posts on the account @originalcobblers, shared the trick in a video which has since amassed more than , views. In the clip he shows people what to do when your zip stops closing and you only need two things to mend it - a pair of plyers and a small hammer. He explains how he often gets customers askingthey can have a new zip because theirs is no longer closing, but actually you donapost need to pay for this. Now a lot of the time you can fix this kind of thing at home with a few very basic tools and Iaposm going to show you quickly how to do it, he says.What we do,you put the zip itself on something hard, give it a hard background. The zip runner itself runs on two plates, top and bottom, they run parallel and after the zip wears a little while, they open up so instead of the teeth interlocking, one sits on top of the other and they donapost close. Our aim today is to tap the back of the zip back into its original position using a pair of plyers on the very back of the zip, so right on the very back either side, a small hammer, we give it a little tap right on the back of the zip runner, not too hard because we donapost want to break it even though itaposs broken, becauseit needs replacing we can. But we always like to try this first... look at that. As he talks he demonstrates how itaposs done on a boot and as he finishes, he pulls the zip closed as heaposs easily managed to fix it without having to replace it.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital.

Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The cost of the items was £., but postage £.!How this can be justied is beyond my reckoning. I have purchased items online where the postage exceeds the cost of the item.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome. Once I qualied, I went around a bit, to Africa, west and east, and the West Indies, but Jura was better than anywhere I went. I hope the people of Jura see this.Leslie McArthur, Carluke, South Lanarkshire.I have contacted our roads department about the icy and, at times, ungritted pavements in my council ward.Many of my justiably concerned constituents have been in regular contact with me on this matter.With all that is going on, whether it#s the latest lockdown or a decreasing local authority budget, our hard-working roads workers are thinly stretched and do not have an easy task. However, when it comes to our pavements and roads, safety must always come first.Our pavements must be safe to walk on all year round.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands.The Scottish Government spin machine’s use of phrases last week like #encouraging progress# about the works at the Rest and Be Thankful cannot disguise its failure to make any real progress towards a solution.At an online briefing session last month, I questioned Transport Minister Michael Matheson on why it says it could take at least five years before it even starts work on a proper solution.He waffled on about planning permission, environmental impact assessments and compensating landowners. This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charities urge government to invest in walking","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather. Campbeltown and Hearts will make a third attempt to meet on Saturday first, and, weather permitting, the kick-off will be at  o’clock.A favourable balance amounting to £,  shillings and d was made by Dunoon Town Council from the crops grown during last season in the Burg Parks. The income amounted to £,  shillings and d and the expenditure to £,  shillings and d.The large steam yacht Beryl, which belonged to the late Lord Inverclyde, and well-known on the Clyde, has been converted into a cable-laying steamer, and is now the property of the Commercial Cable Company, London. The vessel, which has been renamed George Ward, has left the Clyde for the Thames.The principal celebration of Burns’ anniversary in town was in the form of a concert, held in the Victoria Hall on Tuesday night, under the auspices of the local branch ILP. There was a fairly good audience, and a party of four singers and one reciter from Glasgow presented a programme that was well-received and much enjoyed. Castlehill Kirk folk had a Burns’ night in Kinloch Hall on Monday night."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any relaxation of this could have a huge impact in making those figures rise.And it is not a competition # devastatingly, more than , people across the UK have now died with Covid-. We are all in this together and it is as a nation that we need to overcome this unprecedented challenge.At least our young people were able to put the pandemic to the back of their minds to enjoy the snow for a couple of days last week # moments of excitement must be few and far between at the moment, so it is fantastic that they were able to enjoy the snow safely."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thank you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging time.By Jingo, Keith Abendroth has some brass neck in blaming the catastrophe facing Scottish fishing businesses on the dastardly EU. His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world. May we rise to that call, as the new president rises to his."},{"url":null,"title":"walk raises more than 2000 for children 1st","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.#Now, though, I am hearing from fishing families of long standing, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people in total, thaturgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.#This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single, family-operated vessels, smaller fleets, artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.#As a council, we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.#Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.#We are also speaking with local producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that some of these valuable products reach buyers.#He added: #Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and sped up. These products need to be prioritised over less time sensitive products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.#In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.#I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A new-build, fit-for-purpose hub will be used as a meeting place, a thriving place for all ages, groups and clubs to come together in a stunning environment.SID believes that a community hub will play a pivotal role in the area#s long-term recovery from the pandemic, joining the dots between people that require support – connecting them to a range of services to promote inidual and community wellbeing.SID already has £, secured in match funding from Glenmorangie, the owners of the nearby Ardbeg Distillery. This existing commitment demonstrates the strong private sector partnerships in place and their support for the island#s communities.Hamish Torrie, CSR director from the Glenmorangie Company, said: ‘We, the Glenmorangie Company, have been working for many years on the development of this project with SID and the South Islay community.#We are delighted that SID has secured the funding which will, at last, enable the playing fields project to move to the next stage of its development. The community hub will be vital in sustaining the fabric of south Islay for the future.#SID now needs to secure a further £, in match funding to reach its target to deliver the full project. Part of this will be secured through the launch of a community shares initiative within the coming weeks.This project has been in development for a number of years and is anxiously awaited by the community which has shaped it over the years.Local development officer Alyson MacGillivray said: #SID and the community of South Islay have been on a long journey to get to this point. We are so excited to share this very exciting news with our community, particularly after the challenging  months we have all endured – some positive news is just what the community needs at this time.#SID’s chairman, John Findlay, said: #This is a fantastic project that will benefit not only South Islay but the whole of the island. It will give the community a real boost particularly during these challenging times.#I would like to take this opportunity to thank the SID staff: Alyson MacGillivray, local development officer Bonnie Wood, project manager and Fiona Aitchison, finance and admin officer, for all their hard work on this project and in securing substantial government funding.#My thanks also go to the SID board of directors who, through their voluntary roles, have supported the staff every step of the way.#Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council and councillor for the Kintyre and the Islands ward, said: #This is tremendous news for Port Ellen and indeed Islay as a whole. This will be a wonderful and much-needed facility for the island and my thanks to SID for all its hard work thus far.#Fellow Kintyre and the Islands councillor Anne Horn added: #It is fantastic news that SID has been successful in securing a grant from the Scottish Government Regeneration Capital Fund to enable the long-awaited development of the pavilion into a community hub.#This will be a fantastic asset for Port Ellen and for the whole island of Islay. Very well done to everyone for their hard work seeing this plan come to fruition.#South Islay Developmenthas been involved in the development of Port Ellen and its surrounding area since .The organisation was originally established to help address some of the long-term employment and poverty issues in the area and has seen signicant success during its time in operation.A range of capital and revenue projects has been undertaken including development of the only filling station in the area, new motorhome pitches and the harbour pontoons and office in conjunction with partners.Fèis Ìle, a week-long celebration of Scotland’s most distillery-packed island with whisky, music, dancing and more, has had to be cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid- pandemic.Organisers had their fingers crossed that it would be possible to hold the  event between May  and June , but that has proved impossible.In a statement, they said: #With deep regret we announce that this year’s festival is cancelled.#Keeping everyone safe is our top priority. Eventravel to Islay is allowed, the ceilidhs, tastings and large events that make the fèis what it is, will not be able to take place.#We also need to allow for the fact that people need to be able to make their plans to travel and stay.#The dates for the  festival are from Friday May  to Saturday June  and, regarding those who already hold tickets, fèis organisers confirmed they will #be in touch soon about refunds, or transferring to #.The statement concluded: #Islay and its businesses would love to welcome you back when restrictions allow.

John Reid and Alex Harvey judged the tractors.Two pairs of horses competed for the first time since .TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOKinloch Park trees face the chopA number of historic trees in Campbeltown are facing the axe.A recent survey of trees belonging to Argyll and Bute District Council has revealed as many as  are in poor condition and may need to be felled.The sycamores at Kinloch Park are amongst the worst hit. The survey, by a private consultant, revealed  trees were causing concern.A number of trees around Kintyre Park have also been identied as suffering from internal fungal rot. The other  trees causing concern are spread around the town. They include at least two at the council offices in Dell Road. The trees at Kinloch Park have suffered damage to their bark over the years and this is thought to have contributed to the rot.Councillors were expected to meet officials to discuss the situation on Wednesday. Councillor George McMillan told the Courier: ‘It is a great pity about the trees that will have to come down. The trees at Kinloch Park have been there as long as anyone alive can remember.’The council#s policy is to replace any trees which have been felled. Councillor McMillan said he hoped it might be possible to phase the felling over two years.The trees were planted shortly after the park was created in the early s by infilling the shallow mudflats between Campbeltown and Dalintober.FIFTY YEARS AGOQuay mishapWestern Ferries# Campbeltown-Ireland vessel the Sound of Islay was delayed on Monday when a large articulated lorry slipped while being reversed on board.The cabin unit of the lorry, which is owned by local contractor Mr William McMurchy, was hitched to a trailer loaded with timber.

No-one was injured.The lorry, driven by Mr Bruce McMurchy, was later winched off the Sound of Islay.Operations to free the obstruction were hampered by the state of the tide, which was ebbed at the time.The ferry left for Red Bay on Monday afternoon.New houses completedCampbeltown’s Princes Street redevelopment housing scheme has been completed, three months ahead of schedule.The first house key will be handed over next Friday.An official of Campbeltown Town Council said the council was satisfied with the workmanship of the contractors, Ferguson and Martin, the Campbeltown Building consortium.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGODistrict doings # CourDance # What was generally regarded as the finalof the season in this district was held in the recreation hall on the evening of the th ultimate and compared favourably with any similar event which preceded it.Fortied by tact and experience, the committee displayed unusual talent throughout the proceedings and the programme submitted was of a ied and interesting nature.Of a special interest among the vocal items was a pleasing rendition of ‘Let the rest of the world go by’ by Mrs Hendrick, who had a rousing reception, and was the recipient of merited approbation.The usual visitors were present from distant districts and Tarbert and Torrisdale sent representatives of the ‘fair sex’ which gave Carradale well-grounded reasons to ‘look to its laurels’ and it is generally conceded it takes something over the ordinary to occasion that.The catering was in the capable hands of Mr Walker who, with Messrs Cameron and Crichton, rose to the occasion as never before in their respective positions and no laudatory adjectives are required now in Kintyre to describe how Mr Henderson discharges his duties as MC."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Indeed the #evil# Tories are currently in negotiations with the USA, Australia and New Zealand for trade agreements which again would not have been either allowed or possiblewe had been tied to EU regulations.Had the SNP secured independence, it remains to be seenthe EU would have accepted Scotland into the EU, given the financial deficit it currently endures and continues to do so thanks to the current pandemic.Perhaps I should remind Mr Wilson it is the UK government that has managed to secure Scottish jobs using the furlough scheme and secured Covid- vaccinations for all of the UK which seems to have rattled the EU cage that Mr Wilson also occupies.I do agree with him, however, had Scotland been an independent country then his submission of being linked to Somalia and Kazakhstan would be near the truth.Finally, my suggestion to Scottish fishermen was stated in good faith and a possible way out of problems they are experiencing with the EU at present when there was no need to alter the arrangements in place prior to the UK leaving the EU.Knowing from previous items published by the Courier on behalf of Mr Wilson, this is the only time I intend to respond and will continue to polish my brass neck!The vote to leave the EU took place in June , four and half years ago # four and half years in which to start making plans for changes to counter loss or reduction of the existing market for fish products in Europe.I haven#t read of any such plans but, of course, that will be the fault of Westminster the government there should have found new markets for Scottish fish. Doubtless, the government in Holyrood, that is perpetually demanding more powers be devolved to it, was far too busy organising Indyref to spend time looking after the livelihoods of Scottish fishermen.It was obvious that concessions had to be made by both sides in any trade deal, post-Brexit, and it was inconceivable the EU would accept any deal that totally blocked EU boats from our waters instantly. However, Alan Reid and Ron Wilson, it is not bureaucracy on this side of the Channel that is slowing the movement of goods to Europe # that blame lies entirely with a vindictive EU, determined to punish Britain for having the temerity to leave a failing, despotic authority.Ron Wilson, you claim the time is coming when Scotland will reap the benefits of EU membership. Can you explain to me how a country with a massive deficit, . per cent of GDP before the pandemic hit and astronomical now, can even apply for membership, when to qualy a country has to bring its deficit below three per cent Add to that the fact Nicola Sturgeon has affirmed an independent Scotland will retain the pound sterling as currency and EU rules state that a country in monetary union with another country, outside of the EU, cannot under any circumstances join it.Instead of complaining, give thanks that the people of Scotland are being vaccinated now, not in four months# time at best, had we still been dependent on the EU to supply the vaccines.It is being reported, both by opposition MSPs and the national press, that Scotland#s vaccine strategy is being outpaced and starting to seriously lag behind the other three UK home nations and that the SNP has no desire to convene a vaccination task force nor take up the offer of additional British military personnel, to further assist NHS Scotland.Yet, in this time of national emergency, is it not extraordinary that the SNP, Scotland#s devolved administration, has set up a task force to campaign for independence.Rick Warren wrote in The Purpose-Driven Le: #Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but rather thinking less about yourself.#Can Scotland#s domestic government, the SNP, think less on independence and more on beating Covid- and our schools, hospitals and jobs The bins on Kilkerran Road were not collected on Friday last so I left the bin as it would normally be collected the following morning, even though on a weekend.When midday on Saturday came and went, I checked the council website to find out that a vehicle breakdown was the cause of the non-collection and the bins would be collected when a vehicle was available.I left the bin out fully expecting it not to be collected before Monday. To my amazement, at .pm on Saturday afternoon the #freighter# came trundling along and emptied all the bins along Kilkerran Road.This is truly remarkable to have the bins collected not only on a Saturday afternoon but on a freezing cold day into the bargain.These council employees on bin collection, grounds and gardens maintenance deserve every praise and thanks that we the public can bestow.These are the front-line people who keep our town clean and tidy, cemeteries in prime condition and they are often taken for granted.Next time you see them, take a minute to say thanks. They deserve it and more.I have been visited by a Gigha milk #fairy# # or should it be brownie I have been the very appreciative recipient of a large bottle of delicious Wee Isle Dairy milk on a number of occasions. It has appeared asby magic on my back door step.I would love to be able to say thank you to the kind person who has thought of me at this time of lockdown and shielding # thank you Gigha milk fairy, you’ve made me smile!"},{"url":null,"title":"loris lockdown campaign against litter louts","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are delivering the vaccination across a large and challenging geography, during winter, while simultaneously coordinating iable supply of vaccine products.#The challenge really cannot be underestimated but it is thanks to all the staff involved with this programme and the tremendous effort they have put in that we have been able to deliver the vaccine to, as it stands now,  per cent of our population.#Given our remote and rural geography, the majority of the delivery of vaccine to the public will be coordinated by our GP practices, which are ideally located and experienced to do this, given they support our flu delivery programme so well every year. We will, along with Highland and Argyll and Bute councils, provide any additional resources and support that they need to do this successfully.#For our staff in more remote and rural areas, the vaccination is being coordinated by local teams. In Inverness, we are currently using the Centre for Health Science as a location for larger scale delivery.#Dr Davidson explained that one particular challenge was the contact and scheduling of non-NHS frontline staff for vaccination. NHS Highland has a dedicated team in place to support this in the south and mid areas of Highland where the number is largest.He said: #Feedback from colleagues, both those who are vaccinating and those who have been vaccinated, has been positive. We’re also hearing good feedback from those who have been vaccinated by our colleagues in general practice.#We know everyone will be keen to get their vaccine as quickly as possible but would ask that you all please be patient.#We are working our way through the priority groups and you will be asked to attend for your vaccine by your GP practice when it is time for your vaccine. Please don’t call them, they will contact you directly for your appointment.#Dr Davidson added: #Delivery of the vaccine has been exciting to see but it is important to remember that this is only one part of how we can win this fight against Covid-.#Protection for an inidual following vaccination may take weeks to develop and the extent to which vaccination prevents spread of Covid is still unclear. That is why it is so important that, as well as taking up the opportunity to get vaccinated when you are contacted, that we still continue to follow the guidance on how you can keep yourself and others safe.#Please follow FACTS: wear a face covering, avoid crowded areas, clean surfaces, keep a two metre distance and, what I would really like to stress, the importance of self-isolating and booking a testyou have symptoms.#"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In winter, there is the prickly holly bush. Another evergreen is a camellia whose leaves have a shiny, smooth surface and, of course, there is rosemary with its stems of small, slender, fragrant leaves so valued as a herb in the kitchen.Perhaps leaves are like people. We can sometimes encounter some prickly characters who leave us taken aback and hurt by their harsh words.On the other hand, some people have a gt for smoothing out dficult situations and whose personalities just seem to shine.Then there are people who at first sight seem insignicant but on getting to know them bring fragrance and blessing.Soeverything in the garden is going to be lovely, we need to learn to respect each other and realise we are all dferent, dferent in beliefs, colour, personalities and political convictions.Former Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks described that respect as #the dignity of dference#. All major religions teach the importance of understanding one another and practising tolerance of dferent views.Christianity’s great exponent St Paul gave us this advice: #Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one anotherany of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

under the rail bridge on the townrsquos Spott Road to stop the animals from roosting there.Concerns had been raised that birds were swooping from under the bridge and startling drivers, while the animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous and all out of proportion.ldquoNor should the council be thinking of installing netting, as we know many birds can become trapped in netting and suffer horribly before dying.ldquoAlternative solutions

nets cause nesting and visiting birds the most horric distress and injury before death by hanging, starvation or dehydration.Guy Merchant, of Bird Control Consultancy Services International , told the Courier that carrying out a cull would be ldquoa waste of time and money.Similarly, he suggested that putting netting under the width of the bridge could create other problems, such as trapping live birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community Council last month, it was revealed that work under the bridge was due to take place in mid-February.East Lothian Council said that the bridge was lsquohomersquo to ldquohundreds of pigeons which are

How can anyone doubt the threat this poses, and go around feeling insouciant and safe  At a time when every shop door handle holds the menace of a grenade, such an outlook is unfathomable.Yet it is not as uncommon as you might think. Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out. Behind all this lie malevolent manipulators, intent on...well, quite what they hope to achieve by terrying or killing us off remains unclear, but the fear remains potent.Astonishingly, not all Covid naysayers come to their senses when they fall victim. Last autumn, as cases in the US soared, there were reports of victims gasping for air in the emergency room, yet still insisting that Covid was fake. That really does take the breath away. ROSEMARY: In praise of JennersSomehow, though, it feels worse that anyone here could also deny it. It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum. We can mock thwarted Trump voters who continue to believe that the election was rigged, despite not an iota of evidence to support that conclusion. Unlike Covid, where the facts are omnipresent, the US election result has been contested without any foothold in reality. Believing the Democrats cheated says more about protestersrsquo state of mind than about what the ballot boxes contained.And yet, their certainty and grievance are real therersquos no denying that. Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections. Who knows what makes people enter a parallel world to the one beneath our feet. Personally, however, I find the idea that facts and evidence no longer matter even scarier than Covid.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray.

First: the expertsare going to be subject to what is now known as The Govian Response, or ldquoWhat do experts know anyway  The report will also be subject to the Look Over There! Response, which involves ignoring the central conclusions by talking about something  instead.This, in effect, is what Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Economy Secretary, did when she was presented with the findings. ldquoAs an independent member of the EU, she said, ldquofree from the damage of Brexit, Scotland would be part of the huge single market, which is seven times the size of the UK.But that completely ignores what the LSE report actually said ndash what they call the independence paradox. No one denies that Scotland,it rejoined the EU, would be part of a huge single market, but what Ms Hyslop ignores is that the EU is a much less important trade partner for Scotland than the rest of the UK and would remain so for a long time to come, even after rejoining the EU. MARK SMITH: The dilemma every unionist is about to encounterIt is this fact that sets up the paradox. Yes, rejoining the EU as an independent country would boost trade with the EU, but it would also lead to an increase in trade costs with the rest of the UK. What this means is that, in order for Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence would have to destroy a sufficiently large share of our trade with the rest of the UK to make the EU Scotlandrsquos most important partner. This is the paradox: for joining the EU to be economically desirable, independence would have to damage our current economy.Sadly, a lot of that would happen naturally, which is the other part of the report that jumps out at you. When neighbouring countries, or regions, or countries in a close union, set up borders between each other, trade between the two starts to decline big time and this is what would inevitably happen to Scotland for reasons that arenrsquot just economic. Look at this bit of the report: ldquoborder costs result not only from economic policies, such as tarfs, but also from cultural and social dferences between nations that reduce the effectiveness of international communication or lead consumers to prefer domestically produced goods and services. MARK SMITH:Why support for independence is up hellip and the three groups of voters who are still resistant to YesThe logic of that is undeniable ndash you put up a fence, itrsquos harder to talk to the guy on the other side and miscommunication develops. The bit about consumers preferring domestically produced goods and services is also disturbing, isnrsquot it  I can see it now: ldquoBuy Scottish! ldquoBuy English! And the English would have much less to lose ndash trade between RUK and Scotland accounts for .% of RUK output compared to % of Scottish output.The SNP would saythat the lost trade with the rest of the UK would be made up by increased trade with the EU ndash just as Brexiteers said lost trade with Europe would be made up by trade with the rest of the world. But the LSE report makes the reality of that clear: the rest of the UK would remain our biggest trading partner for a long time to come, except that, under independence, the trade would be in terminal decline.In a way, I think thatrsquos the hidden sadness of this new report. No doubt, some of the economic damage of independence would be countered by increased trade with the EU, but those cultural, social and personal dferences the report mentions are a dferent matter altogether. How would we deal with those  How would we deal with the fact that a once-close relationship was becoming a little more distant and dficult every day Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, has insisted she would not apologise for prioritising vulnerable groups, telling MSPs earlier this week that % of elderly care home residents had received their jag.On Thursday, Downing Street, quizzed about the timescale of the UKwide rollout, repeatedly declined to define when spring would end during a briefing for journalists the season ends with the summer solstice on June .However, this morning, the Cabinet Office announced the Government intended to vaccinate all of the first nine cohorts by May.It explained: ldquoThe UKrsquos vaccination programme is planned to have reached all nine priority cohorts by May, meaning the Government can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence and maintain the choice for voters between voting in person or remotely.However, two hours later Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman repeatedly refused to agree the May timescale put out by the Cabinet Office, insisting the commitment was to have offered vaccinations to all those in the first nine cohorts by ldquothe spring and that further details would be set out in the mid-February review.When the spokesman was pressed on why the Cabinet Office knew when spring was but Downing St did not, he replied: ldquoThe press notice was issued in error and I believe the Cabinet Office have now withdrawn this. As we have previously set out, our ambition is to offer all priority cohorts vaccination by spring and that remains our position.Later during a daily briefing with journalists when it was pointed out that the Cabinet Officersquos erroneous announcement was still online, the spokesman paused and then said: ldquoI was wrong in my initial answer in relation to the Cabinet Office press notice. It isnrsquot actually being withdrawn.Askedit was, therefore, now the case that all nine priority cohorts would be vaccinated by the beginning of May, he replied: ldquoAgain, as the PM has said our priority is to offer all the priority cohorts vaccination by spring. The precise timeline will be set out on February  when the current target of vaccinating groups one to four expires.Pressed that No  was now saying, on the one hand, the Cabinet Office timeline was correct but, on the other, it would not confirm this was the case, the spokesman said: ldquoErm, Irsquom saying, erm, erm, what the PM has repeatedly said, in terms of what the ambition is, erm, erm, for offering priority roll-outs for vaccination and thatrsquos by the spring.He pointed out the official timeline was dependent on the availability of supply but the Government was ldquoextremely confident in the success of our vaccines programme and remain on track to meet this ambition.According to Whitehallsvaccines delivery plan, some  million people across the UK are estimated to fall into the first nine groups.The Government is on track to vaccinate the first four cohorts by February  ndash including NHS and care home staff, care home residents, and all those aged  and over.So far, more than .m people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.Categories five to nine include all those aged  and over, as well as adults aged - in an at-risk group.Prioritisation for the rest of the population has yet to be determined."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-fife-centre-first-scottish-government-asymptomatic-testing-expansion","story":"The site at the Maxwell Centre in Cowdenbeath will allow people who do not have coronavirus symptoms to be tested, with no advance booking needed.The Fe site is the first to open since asymptomatic testing was successfully trialled in Johnstone in December.Further proposals for Ayrshire  Arran, Dumfries  Galloway, Greater Glasgow  Clyde, and Grampian have been agreed, and discussions are underway with a number of other boards and local authorities for agreement in the coming days.:Covid- patient wakes from coma to discover hersquos going to be a grandfatherAround one in three people with Covid- does not show symptoms but can still pass the virus on to others.The Scottish Government launched trial asymptomatic testing schemes in several areas towards the end of , but earlier this week Nicola Sturgeon said discussions were taking place for a wider rollout involving most of Scotlandrsquos councils.Rapid community testing was announced for all English local authorities in January.At the coronavirus briefing on Friday, Mr Swinney said the Cowdenbeath testing site would be followed by a further four across Fe in the following weeks.Lateral flow tests will be used at the centres, but any positive cases will be confirmed using the more sensitive PCR tests.Mr Swinney said: ldquoThe targeted expansion of testing in these communities will help more people find outthey have Covid, eventhey donrsquot have symptoms.ldquoIt will help them to knowthey or their contacts need to self-isolate and will therefore play an important part in helping us to stop the spread of the virus.Eight sites have been approved so far, he said, with a further  expected to follow later on Friday.NHS Fe said the Maxwell Centre site will be open from am to pm Monday to Friday and am to pm Saturday and Sunday for people living in Cowdenbeath, Lochgelly and Lumphinnans.Results are normally delivered within a few hours by text or email.:Vaccination centre on wheels delivers jags to regions most vulnerableA post on the health boardrsquos website said: ldquoBy getting tested at one of our community testing sites, you can find outyou have the virus andyou are positive take immediate action to stop the spread of the virus to others by self-isolating.ldquoYoursquoll also have access to the kind of confidential support you might needyou have to self-isolate, including advice and information on accessing dferent financial support alongside practical measures such as food packages.Data from the existing asymptomatic community testing sites is expected to be published on Wednesday next week.:Inside the mass vaccination centre where Army gives Covid- jabsPublic health minister Mairi Gougeon said: ldquoIncreased testing in this way will help us find and isolate more cases by targeting resources with communities where there is high prevalence, helping us to identy more cases of the virus and giving us all a better chance of stopping it from spreading.ldquoHowever, a test only tells uswe are positive at the point in time that we are being tested.ldquoIt does not mean that we can stop following all of the rules and guidelines which are in place to protect all of us.Those who do have coronavirus symptoms, or are self-isolating as a result of being a close contact of a positive case, should still book a PCR test in the normal way."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-cannot-safe-hold-scottish-elections-may","story":"For the last year, the First Minister has urged people to ldquowork from home where possible.

Many of us remember the proposal round about  to double the subway with another loop out to Parkhead in time for the Commonwealth Games, and we are well used to seeing politicians and civic leaders getting on, or merely straddling, a bicycle when a new active travel initiative is announced.Sadly, we rarely see them walking the walk. How many of our politicians and leaders commute by train, by bus, by bike  They can all make the excuse that they have so many meetings, so many places to go that they really do need that private car, along with its expenses and private parking at City Chambers, or wherever they work.If public transport is going to work then we need changes from the top, with politicians and others travelling out to Castlemilk and Easterhouse, and to the well-heeled areas of Kelvindale and Pollokshields, by bus, subway metro, train or perhaps even the bike.Patricia Fort, Glasgow G.THERE ARE MANY CAPTAIN TOMSI NOTE with interest Rebecca McQuillans article .There are many Captain Toms of both sexes, in care homes, living alone and soldiering on, or with family, stoical, kind, modest and unsung.Captain Tom caught the nationrsquos heart and raised many millions of pounds.

Yet, as the hounding of Andy Wightman has shown, this party exists solely at the pleasure of Patrick Harvie and his obsession with sexual identity. A lot of public money is spent each year keeping this group of self-indulgent performance artists in a job and expensive office suites just so Holyrood can look erse and inclusive. KEVIN McKENNA: Third World needs vaccineItrsquos in the recent behaviours and conduct of the SNP, though, that the contamination of public le is most grievously evident. Their leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and a host of her most unquestioning acolytes have manipulated the transgender issue and deployed it to squash all opposition in the party, especially those who have dared to criticise its glacial pace towards a second referendum on independence.If you retain any doubts about how far this party will go to weaponise any seemingly innocent cause consider its new Equalities Mechanism. This lists a bewildering suite of physical and mental impairments that qualy as lsquodisabledrsquo for the purposes of securing preferment on the partyrsquos Holyrood list of electoral candidates. If it was an organisation other than the SNP, yoursquod be inclined to view it as a genuine attempt at widening access. In this party, though, at this time, you know that it will be used to reinforce the credentials of a favoured few.What lends a sinister edge to the party within a party which has begun to emerge in the SNP is the malevolent intent of some who have hollowed it out. It risks permanently disfiguring the legacy of Ms Sturgeon.This is what can happen when a party has been in power too long and there is no meaningful opposition. When Ian Blackford, its Westminster leader, gets to his feet and opens his mouth to squawk another little bit of Scotlandrsquos reputation for integrity and eloquence slinks away mortied to die.Of course,you measure this on numbers alone you might be gratied by that run of polls indicating persistent support for independence. Letrsquos be honest here: such is the toxicity of Boris Johnson and the Faragists who have occupied the UK Conservatives that Osama Bin Laden would have fancied his chances against them in Scotland.Itrsquos a massive grt and an expensive con trick played on the Scottish people who were assured  years ago that Scotland would become home to a new kind of politics. In this, the interests of ordinary workers would be paramount in the long-term goal of redistributing wealth and tilting the scales in favour of the many. In , though, we find that the dial hasnrsquot moved at all. To cover its failures the SNP ndash in power for  of those years ndash has opted instead for government by announcement and a series of applause breaks.It has become home to a self-indulgent class of political hustlers leeching on power and putting their stage-managed whims ahead of real issues by using their superior connections and networking skills gathered on dozens of approved leadership courses. KEVIN McKENNA: SNP duping supportersTwo decades of devolution have produced this land of make believe where nothing is as it seems and all the main players are actors who have forgotten what it was they once actually stood for. Civic Scotland has thus become a chilling re-working of the Truman Show. In this version, we are all the schmucks, believing that what we experience each day is real and that the men and women who shape our lives really are working for social improvement and a fairer society.Underpinning all of it is a press and media where too many journalists are eager to touch the hem of power in the hope of a cosy, well pensioned adviserrsquos job or a position in one of Holyroodrsquos pet lobbying firms. Theyrsquod rather be exchanging Christmas cards and affectionate DMs with the FM and her Stepford cabinet. Defending her at every turn is preferable to holding her to account.This political land of moonbeams and unicorns doesnrsquot actually celebrate dference but imprisons it. Only a state approved and orthodox ersity is permitted, underpinned by a lexicon of words and phrases to sort out the wheat from the chaff. When Irvine Welsh had Renton spit those immortal lines in Trainspotting at Corrour station  years ago he couldnrsquot have known that they have become prophetic. ldquoItrsquos a s***e state of affairs to be in, Tommy, and all the fresh air in the world wonrsquot make any f****** dference!The sweetness of independence will be soured knowing that in order to achieve it we had to keep this shower of inauthentic charlatans in large salaries, swollen expenses and gold-plated pensions to achieve it.

The Northern Isles continue to see a lower prevalence compared to the Scottish mainland, and it is in everyone’s interest to keep it that way.“I have been making the case for testing ahead of travel to the islands for weeks now.

There’s a whole chain of businesses in Orkney negatively affected by this.“It beggars belief that, during a pandemic and with an economic recovery effort underway in the islands, our own local authority would bypass Orkney businesses in this way, threatening local jobs in their own community.#What happened to their ‘buy local’ ethos  There’s also the issue of sustainability to think about and the impact of shipping stone all the way from Oban to Orkney, when it’s available right here on our doorstep.#Hard questions need to be asked about how a situation like this could possibly arise, particularly during a pandemic when the economic welfare of our community should be a top priority.“I’m fully aware that, by drawing attention to this issue, I’m probably doing my own business no good at all in terms of future orders from Orkney Islands Council, but this is much, much bigger than Orkney Aggregates.#This is about proper, transparent procedures and the massive, negative impact this questionable decision will have for our community.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So Irsquom going to act. Irsquom going to act fast. Irsquod like to be doing it with the support of Republicanshellip theyrsquore just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go.The jobs report landed shortly after Senate Democrats cast a decisive vote to muscle the Covid relief plan through the chamber without Republican support, a step toward final approval next month.Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, her first.President Bidenrsquos speech solidied a marked sht in tone and strategy for a president who entered the White House pledging bipartisanship and met on Monday with  Republican senators pushing a slimmed-down  billion dollars alternative.President Biden concluded in his Friday speech that aid at that level would only prolong the economic pain.Senate Democrats applauded after Ms Harris announced the chamberrsquos - vote on the budget measure at around :am.The action came after a gruelling all-night session, where senators voted on amendments that could define the contours of the eventual Covid- aid bill.Following Senate approval, the House passed the measure - on Friday afternoon, also without a Republican vote.The coronavirus aid package can now work its way through congressional committees with the goal of finalising additional relief by mid-March, when extra unemployment assistance and other pandemic aid expires.It is an aggressive timeline that will test the ability of the new administration and Congress to deliver.ldquoWe have been focused like a laser on getting this done, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after leading Democrats in the House met with President Biden on Friday.ldquoWe hope to be able to put vaccines in peoplersquos arms, money in peoplersquos pockets, children safely in schools and workers in their jobs.

Thatrsquos a fact.The unemployment rate fell to .% from .%, but there was a decline in the number of people who were either working or looking for a job in a sign that people are dropping out of the labour force.

As well as delivering goods and services that we all need, those same firms provide crucial employment for other Shetlanders.And as money spent locally is more likely to stay in Shetland, helping other companies and their employees rather than multinational corporations or shareholders outwith the isles, it’s a win-win situation.Economists call it the local multiplier effect. We call it common sense and everyone can do their bit simply by doing more shopping locally.Large and small businesses across the isles need our support at what is a tough time due to the uncertainty caused by coronavirus. But shopping locally is not about spending out of sympathy. It’s about supporting each other, finding what you need in your own community and helping it thrive.There’s not much you cannot get in Shetland. From top-notch food and drink to expert advice, stylish and weatherproof clothing to perfect perfumes – local businesses can provide it all.Times are changing and most people rely on digital services and online deliveries for some items. There is nothing wrong with that – but it is worth remembering the vast range of Shetland-based businesses that are here to help.Many companies are able to match online prices and customers get the added bonus of not having to worry about delivery delays. Plus there is the advantage of having someone close at hand to help with any follow-up queries.Shetland is rightly proud of its enterprising spirit and Shetlanders should be proud of the businesses that thrive here.Despite the dficult circumstances, that is as true today as it has always been and supporting Shetland firms is more important than ever.As a locally-owned, published and printed newspaper The Shetland Times certainly thinks so. That is why we have been running a #shoplocalfirst campaign over recent months.Our community can support Shetland businesses by shopping locally more often. It’s easy, reliable and good value.So whether it is goods or a service that you require think about what is on offer on your doorstep and Shop Local First...Nominations have started arriving for the the Shetland Community Spirit Awards which were launched last week.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3603301.jpg--.jpg?1612448490000\n","title":"iron ore mines and ghost railway stations just part of the dungonnell trail","story":"ONE of the Ballymena area’s best kept walking ‘secrets’ is found in the hills above the village of Cargan which is the population centre for the beautul wider area known as Glenravel. Skerry Road East, perhaps the least busy road in Northern Ireland, is part of the Dungonnell Trail but it also runs past the evidence of this area’s industrial past.If you’ve ever driven out of Cargan and on towards Cushendall and Waterfoot you will have seen the signs of railway lines in the valley below.The article below, which sets this story in context, first appeared in its entirety in The Glynns Volume and is currently hosted online via the website of the Glens of Antrim Historical Society. It is drawn from the ‘Iron Mines of Glenravel’ by Kevin J. O’Hagan“Within the last two years an extensive and valuable iron mine was discovered at Glenravil about  miles from Ballymena by James Fisher Esq. of Cleggan Lodge near this town and of Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire. Under the energetic management of this enterprising gentleman it was opened about  months ago.”So read the editorial of the Ballymena Observer, Saturday, July th, , commemorating the opening of the first of the Glenravel iron ore mines.Just three weeks earlier Mr. Fisher himself had given an open-air party for about fty gentlemen friends on the mountainside near the mine. It was an unusual repast, but no more unusual than the event it commemorated for here, in one of the bleakest, most barren and out-of-the-way places in the country, rich seams of iron ore had been found and mud-stained miners were raising  tons of top quality ore per week.This situation could hardly have been envisaged a few years earlier, not even by Fisher. Others before him were aware of the existence of iron-bearing rock but failed to exploit it or to locate the richer seams.The first had been Nicholas Crommelin, who, in , in his task of settling the area and building the village which bears his name, found a sample of the ore.He had it analysed by Professor John F. Hodges who found it to contain from  to % peroxide of iron. Crommelin’s enthusiasm got the better of him and he set about building a furnace to smelt the ore using the local peat for firing.He made repeated attempts to smelt the ore and succeeded in obtaining some metallic iron but the dficulties were so great that he abandoned the idea altogether.His furnace still stands near the village of Newtowncrommelin, a monument to his endeavours.Some years later Hodges was again called to examine some specimens in the possession of Edward Benn, the Glenravel landlord.These were obviously much richer specimens than Crommelin’s for Hodges was now convinced that valuable deposits lay hidden in the Glenravel mountains.Benn had his ore smelted by a local smith, John McAlister of Legegrane, who managed to produce a small sample of iron.This was then taken to Rowan’s foundry in Belfast where it was mistakenly identied as having been produced from the best Swedish ore.This was praise indeed but it seems strange that Benn himself took his discovery no further.Perhaps he was deterred by the failure of ious other projects with which he was connected — the distillation of alcohol and the distillation of paraffin — and was reluctant to invest money in any new venture.At any rate, it wasn’t until the arrival of James Fisher on the scene that mining the ore became a serious proposition.Credit for the initiation of the successful exploitation of the mineral wealth of this area is traditionally given to the parish priest of the time, Rev. Wm. John Macauley. He was a keen rambler and interested in geology and he was aware that the home-based linen industry, by which the majority of his parishioners lived, was in decline owing to the rise of the large spinning mills.His parish included the Braid and no doubt because of this he became acquainted with James Fisher who was then residing at Cleggan House, the property of Lord O’Neill.When a parishioner showed Father Macauley a piece of red rock he had found, Mr. Fisher was immediately contacted for Fisher already had mining interests in N. W. England, an iron ore producing region.The pair of them then set off on an exploration trip to Ballynahavla, near Cargan accompanied by two other men, one of whom had found the ore in the first place.They went almost directly to the spot and lting back a piece of overhanging turf discovered a seam two feet thick. They at once proceeded to Glenravel House to see Edward Benn who encouraged them to investigate further and gave Fisher permission to dig for a year at a rent of pound. The stage was thus set for one of the greatest industrial booms of the century which was to last nearly  years.In  Fisher began by outcrop digging or opencast mining at a place known as the Gullets, on the slopes of Slievenanee, and in the first six months was able to ship , tons of ore to England worth about pound per ton. It was not long, however, before he realised that more and better ore lay within the outcrop and he began to drive adits.The first underground mine to be opened was aptly named the Glenravel mine, situated in the townland of Legegrane on the south slope of Slievenanee.This was in January . Soon, other enterprising gentlemen began to take note, among them Silas Evans who laid the foundations of the Antrim Iron Ore Company which quickly took up large parcels of the country.There was a great influx of people into the area and several mining villages sprang up, chief among them Fisherstown, named after James Fisher, but now with the uninteresting name of Cargan.The ordinary farm workers of the area took to the novel type of employment and soon acquired the new skills of mining.Wages of  - per week in  rose in  to  - and  - per week for underground workers and to  - and  - per week for surface workers. By  there were about  men employed directly in the mines and  horses were being used in carting away the ore. To facilitate this Fisher had built his own tramway which ran from the Gullets to Parkmore, a distance of two miles.There was as yet no narrow-gauge railway from Ballymena.Most of the miners were labourers and small farmers and the owner of a small farm could even do part-time work at the mines when farming conditions permitted.This helped to supplement his farm income. This new-found source of wealth led to a rather unruly sort of le and drinking sprees and brawls were common.Fisherstown was so wild that children were not allowed on the street when the miners were in town — a situation more akin to the Wild West in the goldrush days.At the start of mining operations levels were driven generally two or three at a time. A connecting passage was then cut to join these levels together to provide a cir-culation of air to the miners and to disperse explosive fumes.From this stage the mine was extended horizontally generally following the ore seam and this gave rise to the term — the Longwall method — literally along the wall of the passage. As soon as a sound roof was met with, side roads were driven right and left and from these the working areas branched off approximately  yards apart. In these areas the miner excavated the ore with a pick and shovel in a cramped and awkward position lying on his side. He removed the ore and waste rock in a wide circular sweep andthe roof was thought to be unstable or unsafe he left pillars of rock standing to support it. This method of mining was known as the ‘room and pillar’ and many examples of it are still visible today in these mines.Probably early in the process rails were laid into the mine to provide a means of removing the waste rock as well as the ore. For this reason the main adit was driven  feet high by  feet wide to accommodate a double line of rails. Alternatively,a single line was considered sufficient or the level was for ventilation only, e.g. an air drt, it was driven only  feet wide. As the workings progressed the waste rock within the mine was used to block off workings which became exhausted or to support the roof in place of the ore which had been removed.The miners worked on a sht system so that they would not be mining ore all day.This meant that they worked half the day in the mine digging ore and the other half on the surface loading it or doing some other job. They would be replaced at the ore face by other miners who had been on the surface during the morning sht.The hours in the Glenravel mines were  a.m. to  p.m. By the early ’s several mines were being worked — Fisher at Slievenanee, the Crommelin Mining Co. at Tuftarney, the Antrim Iron Ore Co. at Cargan and Dungonnell and Mr. Charles Chambers and the Evisnacrow Iron Co. at Evishnacrow. Mining had also extended to other areas, namely Parkmore, Glenarf, Rathkenny, Carncormick and Broughshane.Up to this time the mines had been worked solely for iron ore. Aluminium was still a virtually unknown commodity and it was only in  that it was realised it could be obtained from bauxite.In fact, these minerals, aluminium and iron, are two of the most common elements of the Earth’s crust between them making up nearly % of the total composition. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the ores of these metals, bauxite and iron ore, formed by the prolonged weathering of basalt lavas, are found side by side in the Antrim hills.It was Professor Hodges again who, probably because of his familiarity with the ores of the district, discovered bauxite in the Cargan Mine in .This discovery added more interest and potential to the mining industry and boosted out-put from the mines for several years. During these years too the narrow-gauge railway had arrived, reaching Cargan in May  and Retreat in October . Branch lines were laid to the ious groups of mines and these facilitated the ore being removed quickly from the mines to Ballymena and thence to Larne for shipment.The Wire Tramway, an overhead bucket system built in  for transporting the ore from Cargan to Red Bay, had come and gone, having been sabotaged on the night of Sunday, July th  and never repaired. Nevertheless, mining then even as today was dependant on an efficient means of getting ore away quickly. The railway encouraged expansion in the mining industry and made the ore more valuable because it was more accessible.However, in the early ’s, due to a slump in the iron industry in Britain and the exhaustion of the better-classores, production started to dwindle. The production of bauxite continued and some mines went over completely to the mining of bauxite e.g. Tuftarney and Evishnacrow mines, the latter being worked up to . Iron ore production carried on at a reduced pace in most of the mines and towards the turn of the century the Crommelin company even opened a series of new mines along the east side of the Skerry Water and two bauxite mines on the west side.In general, however, the number of working adits steadily declined and desperate ef-forts were sometimes called for to prolong mining, e.g. at the Cargan Mine where numerous volcanic dykes displaced the ore seam, the miners had to bore their way through  feet of solid rock in an attempt to locate the seam but had to give up. Three of the five adits were soon to be closed but in , in attempting to reopen one of them, an additional problem was encountered for the mine was by this time flooded.In , a prophetic writer, R. A. Watson, in an article in the Dublin University Magazine, made the comment that it would take some hundreds of years before these ore deposits would become exhausted, but sadly prophesy and actuality are seldom one and the same. All mining enterprises have to be abandoned sooner or later either because the deposits are exhausted or their extraction no longer pays. Mining, therefore, must eventually disappear from any area since it is only a temporary form of occupation. It is a natural progression. It took Nature millions of years to produce these minerals and what the miners removed in a few short decades cannot be replaced.The mines eventually closed and no one is really to blame. Various factors contributed to the decline, one of the main ones being the unfavourable dip of the ore seam which often caused flooding.Fisher’s mines, the original Glenravel Mines closed on --  because the best quality ore had been worked out and the second quality was considered uneconomical to work. Adits  and  of the Evisnacrow Mines were last worked on -- and closed because of the company’s inability to work them at a profit.The British Portland Cement Manufacturing Co. took over the bauxite mine here in  but the bauxite proved unsuitable for their purpose and the mine was abandoned on --. The Dungonnell Mines were subject to flooding but they were abandoned in  because of disagreements between the mining company and the leaseholders. The Crommelin Co. too was plagued by flooding problems as well as the ore failing but still managed to excavate an exten-sive series of workings at Skerry East, many of which are still accessible.Quite apart from these reasons there are three other factors which contributed to the closure of the mines.Firstly, there were no smelters in Co. Antrim and the ore had to be shipped to mainland Britain.Secondly, the quality of the iron ore was not good enough for smelting on its own — it had to be mixed in the furnaces with other richer, imported ores. The bauxite, too, was not entirely suitable for the manufacture of aluminium and only a small proportion was used for this purpose. Imported bauxite was cheaper and more suitable and so the demand for Antrim bauxite declined.Thirdly, the high cost of transport from the mines to the smelters and processing plants left little profit for the mining companies.Although the mining industry in Glenravel appeared to have died prematurely it was not forgotten. With the outbreak of World War Two a new crisis loomed in the shape of U-boats and it became increasingly dficult to obtain foreign bauxite.In  Lord Beaverbrook announced to the nation that there was a scarcity of aluminium, and aluminium was a vital ingredient in the manufacture of war planes.By this time Germany was producing about % more aluminium than the USA because of her control of Aluminium-producing countries. So it was that interest in the Antrim bauxites was rekindled and this led to re-investigation of local reserves. In  new bauxite mines were opened at Newtowncrommelin known as the Skerry Mines.Other abandoned workings were reopened for their bauxite content and many Glenravel miners and sons of miners were recruited to work in the new mines. Many travelled daily to work in the vast labyrinth at Lyle’s Hill, Templepatrick.The Skerry Mines closed early in  and mining as an industry finally ceased on --.

The contractors, Garden Escapes, will be arriving on site on Wednesday  February to commence work.This is the first of three replacement play parks that will be completed under Council’s current round of investment in play. Work will also be commencing shortly at Legg Park, Carrickfergus and at Ballygally play park.Further investment has also been secured which will see an extension to the play provision at Millbrook Play Park that will include a number of new, inclusive pieces of play equipment, thanks to funding from the Department for Communities.Championing the vital role that play parks have on the health and wellbeing of young people in the borough, the Mayor of Mid and East Antrim has welcomed news that works are commencing at Ballykeel.Councillor Peter Johnston said: “Access to quality play parks has an important role for the mental, physical and social wellbeing of all of the children in Mid and East Antrim. “Establishing better quality play parks is part of our wider ambition to ensure that communities have a real sense of identity and place, and that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy them. This Council is determined to supply and look after our parks for future generations to enjoy.“I am delighted that so many people engaged with Council’s online surveys last year which have helped inform the design of the replacement play parks at Ballykeel, Legg Park and Ballygally and I look forward to these designs coming to fruition.”All four projects are due to be complete in spring .

Heres how you can make it and what you need to serve it up!  Pancake mix - serves   egg  cup of self raising flour  potato peeled and grated   bunch of spring onions Salt and pepper  cup of milk  For the salad  bag of mixed leaf salad salad  cherry tomatoes    red onion sliced  packet of smoked salmon   Cream cheese mix  tablespoons of cream cheese  tablespoons of wholegrain mustard  To make the pancakes Transfer the grated potatoes to a dry tea towel and squeeze any excess water out. Transfer to a large bowl. Break in the egg and mix well, add the flour and mix again. Slowly add spring onion and gradually add milk . Heat a large non stick pan to the stove bring up to a medium heat. Drizzle in a little oil . Add approximately one tablespoon of the mix and cook for approximately three minutes each side until golden brown. Repeat For the poached egg bring a small saucepan with   pint of water to the boil, add one tablespoon of white vinegar or the juice of one lemon and a pinch of salt. Whisk it together - this will create a whirlpool effect. Add in your egg and take off the heat. To make the salad Place the mixed leaf in a large mixing bowl along with tomato and red onions and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle a little olive oil through the salad. For the cream cheese mix, quite simply mix together! Add a little salt pepper to taste of your liking. The presentation In a large bowl or plate place the pancake at the bottom of the dish. Arrange your salad . Neatly place on the smoked salmon and while this is being done the egg will be cooked. Lt it out with a slotted spoon and dab onto a sheet of kitchen paper - this drains off any access water. Place it on top of the salad, add the bit of baby spinach and some black pepper... and enjoy!

Although the registration forms stated that only £ would be refundedthe assessment was cancelled, the AQE Board and its membership of  local grammar schools decided unanimously that an additional exceptional ex-gratia payment of £ should also be provided, given this year#s unique circumstances.

Times have changed.It has been a dramatic  months in the le of education, but at the heart of it today stand virtually empty school buildings.Corridors echo with the occasional sounds of solitary footsteps. There is no hustle and bustle of pupils rushing between classes, little general chatter between friends.School has become very much a lonely place in what has been a year of isolation for so many.Around  pupils arrive for the day at the gates of the school each morning.We#re running at around % of our normal numbers, said Stephen Taylor, who after six years as principal at the Downpatrick college, almost feels like he has gone back to school himself to learn a new set of skills in how best to manage the education of a young person.There are no calls of stop running in the corridor as pupils race to beat the first bell. The clatter of the locker room has fallen silent. There is no queue of buses for the morning drop-off.I#d love to get those days back, said Stephen. We may not have thought it at the time, but things were much easier where we were.These days most pupils are dispersed around the country and keeping track of all the needs, questions, even simple things like checking how they are, is a logistical nightmare.It#s quiet, said Stephen. You can#t get past that fact. I#d love to have the school full of activity, but that#s just not the way things are right now. The buzz has gone.It has all turned into a fine balancing act, walking the tightrope of keeping everyone as safe as possible by following restrictions, but also making sure the pupils get what they need despite being out of sight. Out of sight maybe, but not out of mind.It#s not just the pupils we need to look after, said Stephen. It#s the teachers too. They all have their own concerns at home. Many of them are working in isolation. It can be a lonely job, so we meet each week, share thoughts and ideas, keep each other motivated and generally help each other out.Staying on top of communication has probably been the biggest hurdle. We try to stay in touch with pupils and parents as much as possible. That may mean phone calls once a week to make sure the pupils are coping, or to parents to seethere#s anything  they need.The school has now decided the best way forward is to make sure as many pupils as possible have access to remote devices, so the decision was made to dip into the pockets of the diminishing budget. Some £, has been spent on providing Chromebooks to supply as many pupils as possible with a direct link to school le.We looked at the bigger picture and thought this was the best solution both for now and for the future, said Stephen.From the start of next September all pupils entering Year  will have access to a Chromebook to aid their learning.Something will have to give where.It#s hard to see us welcoming back every pupil in the immediate future, he said. It#ll take a lot of time before we can go back to where we were. Making sure everyone has the access they need to learning made the decision to invest in technology an easy one.We were finding access to online learning was becoming a game of pass the parcel for families who had more than one child.We regularly survey parents on how things are going, he added. Around % of pupils are engaging with their school work between pm and midnight.The amount of work being asked of pupils has improved, but it was the school on its own, providing for its own.The pastoral side of school le hasn#t been overlooked either.We made the decision, again from our own budget, to employ a full-time youth worker to help pupils not only in what they face in school, but outside the school environment too, Stephen added.Practical support is there now, and will still be there when the pupils finally get back through the doors. That will also allow teachers to teach and not have to deal with other issues that can affect an education.It#s naive to think all schoolchildren will be back in September. It#s going to be blended learning for some time. That#s why we#ve had to safeguard the future and we#ll be seeing the effects for years to come.Next on the to-do list is making sure all teachers know what is expected when grading this summer#s exam year students.Stephen added: With pupils away for so long, the amount of evidence is much less this year. And there#s more pressure on the horizon.When I started here six years ago there was underfunding. Teachers are a resilient bunch, but we#re all going to need help from the community around us.Some foothills on the path through Covid have been conquered. A mountain range lies ahead.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadArrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Dynamics have changed, says DUP#s Foster on NI protocol benefits remarksLatest EducationAQE presses on with plans for November transfer testConvicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority NI students to get £ Covid- paymentNI student medics to miss out on £k Covid recognition bonus given to health service trainees Latest from Belfast Roy Hodgson: Top-half finish will be a tough ask for Crystal PalaceMyanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad is not an essential journey, the Garda said in a statement.The force saidenforcement is required a fixed payment notice for € will be issued to each person who is in breach of the regulation.The new rules mean the Garda can turn back day-trippers from Northern Ireland.Under the Republic#s current Covid- restrictions, travel is restricted to within km of a person#s home except for essential reasons.People travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad may also be liable for a € fine.On Friday night, unionist politicians said the Garda action undermined Irish Government claims the border could not be policed.East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said: This is a bit awkward for Simon Coveney and the #no hard border# sledgehammer brigade. Seems like the RoI government is taking a decent go at hardening the existing international border between their country and Northern Ireland. It would seem the Republic can enforce a north-south border when it suits - which once again blows apart their arguments about the NI Protocol and it also demonstrates how hollow their antics have been for the last four years. The Irish position was never about the Belfast Agreement or peace. It was entirely self-serving. The border deniers will have been left scratching their heads on this one, the MP said.UUP MLA Doug Beattie said the Garda move was a game-changer.We have been told for four and a half years that not only can we not have a hard border, we cannot have a single camera on the border, he said. Within the past week we have seen that the EU is prepared to instigate a hard border and today we find the Garda are ready, willing and able to secure the border from am on Monday. This is an absolute game changer and means that the entire Brexit negotiations took place under  pretences. Given the fiasco that the Protocol has turned out to be, it is now time to reassess the situation. A border was put in the Irish Sea to placate those who promoted veiled threats of a potentialto violence should the hardening of the land border be considered. That has now been exposed as a sham. We must now negotiate an agreement which restores the trading links with the rest of the UK and undoes the damage done to the Belfast Agreement by the Protocol.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signatures, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest Coronavirus#I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Isle of Man celebrates: NI expats enjoy the end of pandemic restrictionsCovid has completely changed my le for the worse, says mother-of-twoQuarantine all arriving in NI without delay, says top expertAndree MurphyOpinionPolice have now got huge credibility headacheLatest from Belfast Myanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positionsMarcelo Bielsa believes Pablo Hernandez still has a lot to offer Leeds,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But closer to home, just  minutes# flying time from Belfast, the Isle of Man is celebrating its own victory. This week the island, which has a population of , people, became the first place in the British Isles to completely end its coronavirus restrictions.The lting of the rules came less than a month after several new cases were detected on the island, prompting a -day #circuit breaker# lockdown.After more than six months without social distancing measures, a cluster of positive coronavirus tests was detected and the Isle of Man went into its second lockdown on January .The island has not had any unexplained community cases of the virus for over  days and that means its  pubs, schools and shops have now reopened, people are able to leave their homes with social distancing and the wearing of face coverings scrapped.In total it has had just  cases since the outbreak of the pandemic and  deaths. Lockdown rules were strictly enforced, with people jailed for breaching the regulations. Restrictions have been entirely lted, after what the country#s Chief Minister Howard Quayle called its supportive, patriotic public.He has praised islanders for their collective determination and community spirit in helping eliminate Covid-.The island has long been a popular venue with Northern Ireland travellers, especially the road racing fraternity who flock there every year for the biggest event in the sporting calendar, the Isle of Man TT.For those from Northern Ireland who have chosen to make the island their home, there is a sense of euphoria but also a feeling of sadness when they look to home and see that it is nowhere near that same point. While le has now ed to normal on the island, its borders remain closed to outsiders, so the chance of a trip back across the Irish Sea for people like retired businessman Robert Saunders is some way off yet. Robert , who is originally from Bangor and moved to the island  years ago, is among those living close to its capital city, Douglas. He says he is elated that his adopted homeland has eliminated Covid for a second time. The father-of-two believes sticking to the rules has been key to the island#s successI feel sorry for bigger nations that aren#t out of the woods yet and for people who flaunt the rules, Robert told the Belfast .Hereyou didn#t do what you were told, you went to jail. There is real elation on the island this week and almost everybody feels that our government has done a really good job in getting us to this point. We#re just missing not being able to get away as we#re not allowed to leave for the moment but it#s better to stay safe. It#s great to be able to go to places like the supermarket without a mask and feel normal again. Now we#re just focused on getting our vaccines because the roll-out hasn#t been as quick as Northern Ireland. Mary Moodyand her family made the move to the Isle of Man from Magilligan outside Derry  years ago. Like many people, it was for work because the place was booming, Mary explained. Before that I never even knew where the Isle of Man was and my family were in a bad way about us moving away but looking back it was the right choice. Le might be back to some normality for the mother-of-two, a manager at Lloyds Pharmacy, but she says her heart goes out to those in Northern Ireland who have some way to go yet. It#s terrible that things aren#t going quite so well back home in terms of conquering the virus, Mary added.The key for us has been closing the borders and keeping people out. We all stuck to our guns too and now we#re lucky that le has ed to normal.People in Northern Ireland just need to take a leaf out of our book and knuckle down, stick to the rules and they#ll get there too. Everyone is in great spirits here this week and looking forward to getting out this weekend. For me, the best thing was getting to see my family again last night. I#ve really missing not seeing my three grandchildren, especially as another one is due in June.For Belfast native Patrick Moloney , getting his hands on an Ulster fry is first on his list when he gets back home again. Now running his own electrical company, the father-of-three says making the move  years ago was the best decision he has ever made. While things were grim in Northern Ireland when I left, I still like getting back to see my brothers and sisters. As soon as I get off the boat next time I#ll be straight into one of the city centre cafes for a fry-up and a big mug of tea. But things seems to be very bad there at the minute and I really don#t think it has been drilled into people enough how serious a situation it is. Like his fellow islanders, Patrick praised how the government there got a grip on the virus.Everyone has done an excellent job and people were on the ball the whole time so we know we#ve been very lucky here, he added. For anyone who stepped out of line, there was no such thing as a fine - it was straight to prison for up to six weeks and I think that was the only way to deal with them.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadArrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Dynamics have changed, says DUP#s Foster on NI protocol benefits remarksLatest Coronavirus#I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Covid has completely changed my le for the worse, says mother-of-twoQuarantine all arriving in NI without delay, says top expertAndree MurphyOpinionPolice have now got huge credibility headacheLatest from Belfast Roy Hodgson: Top-half finish will be a tough ask for Crystal PalaceMyanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The petition was launched at am on Thursday and in just over  hours hit the threshold to require a parliamentary response.Mrs Foster said: “As one part of our five-point plan to scrap the Protocol, I applied for and secured a Parliamentary e-petition. It is a symptom of the concern, that in just over hrs k people across every constituency in the United Kingdom have called on Parliament to trigger Article  and deliver unfettered GB-NI trade.Whilst we have reached the k trigger, I encourage people throughout Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom to keep signing and keep registering your support for our campaign to free us from the protocol. The campaign has not finished. We need to keep going. The First Minister continued: We have made the case to the Prime Minister and now the people have made a very public appeal to the Government of their country to act. This is not the time for more words and drawn-out processes. This time for affirmative action to ensure that there is an unfettered flow of goods within the United Kingdom single market.YES!

Northern Ireland#s decline compared with a % year on year fall across the UK which marked the worst January since .It is now six years since car sales here had signicantly increased - a trend which would hit the second-hand market. He added: The fall in new car sales over the last few years, and particularly last year, will reduce the supply of vehicles into the used car market.  was the last year that NI posted a meaningful increase in new car sales with registrations down % since then. It remains to be seen whether the new car sales market can reverse its recent decline in  and climb the priority spending list for consumers.Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said selling online had not been enough to halt the drop in new registrations.Lessons learned from the first lockdown have seen traders bolstering their e-commerce propositions to meet the changing purchasing habits of the consumer, selling cars via delivery and on a #click and collect# basis, but their valiant efforts fell short last month.As well as a desire to see forecourts reopening sooner rather than later as we move further into , sellers will also be looking to those consumers who have built up savings during the pandemic to start committing again to big ticket purchases like a new car.Although the industry is still producing high quality vehicles and is doing its best to stimulate demand with attractive financing deals, concerns still abound re the infrastructure needed to support dferent fuel types.Ms Johnson said more charge points were needed for a rise in sales of alternatively-fuelled cars.She added: Consumer demand for the next generation of vehicles with low or zero emissions is undoubtedly muted due to the underlying caution around the well-publicised roll out of charging points - particularly in rural areas. Northern Ireland has the lowest number of charging points per capita than any other region in the UK, so it is clear more must be donesales are to gather pace in the next few years.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said it was a bad start to the year for the industry, which lost £.bn in sales last year. He added: The necessary lockdown will challenge society, the economy and our industry#s ability to move quickly towards our ambitious environmental goals.

The -metre private landing strip at Slemish Airfield was constructed in  and is operational with  flights permitted annually. The first landing took place in July.The proposed new LED lights, which are cms off the ground, can be activated by the pilot when five miles from the landing strip and would operate for  minutes.The application was made by Ernie Graham and his we Dr Karen Graham. They built the luxurious Slemish Retreat and Spa near the landing strip in the picturesque Braid Valley.The proposal has resulted in  objections on potential impact on wildle and concerns over noise. Planning officers have said they are confident these issues have been addressed.Speaking remotely at the meeting, TUV leader Jim Allister said: I think the treatment of objectors by the Planning Department in the council has been quite shameful.He claimed that a request for a Zoom meeting in December with objectors was ignored. He criticised what he described as procedural unfairness saying that each party must have the right to be heard.Mr Allister proceeded to describe the application as creeping development.He suggested that it is being sought in a bid to facilitate night-time flights.This is an idyllic part of the Braid Valley. It is farmland. What are night-time flights going to do  Think of the impact on livestock.I urge the committee to refuse this brazen application.DUP MLA Paul Frew told the meeting that he considered the proposal to be industrialisation of the Braid Valley.He questioned why lighting had not been part of the original application.I would urge the committee to think of the flora and fauna, river basin, issues around milking cows and sheep with lambs, he said.Larne Lough DUP councillor Paul Reid said that he had lived a mile-and-a-half from Belfast International Airport previously and not one sheep ever ran when a plane came into land.Carnlough Road resident Judy Irwin, who lives opposite the runway, highlighted what she described as a massive shocking change in the local area.She maintained that multi-coloured runway lights are essential for health and safety, they should have been included in the original application.Carrickfergus Ulster Unionist councillor John McDermott pointed out that the lights are a safety feature and would not affect wildle.Braid DUP councillor William McCaughey stressed that the application has been made in the interest of safety.To date, two daytime flights have been redirected to this airstrip due to poor visibility and light, he stated.This airstrip is integrated into the landscape in such a way it is barely distinguishable from the ground without the landing perimeter being highlighted.He went on to say that the landing strip lights will only be visible for  minutes per flight.I do not see it breaking any regulations. I welcome the recommendation to grant approval of this application.Engineer Ivan Scott, who has been involved with the scheme since the start, said: It is for private purposes. The client has a dwelling adjacent to this site. The purpose of the lights is to ensure the perimeter of the airstrip is clearly marked for the pilot#s approach. It is a grass airstrip.He stressed that the lights would be at ground level and not lamp posts.Proposing approval of the application, former RAF Wing Commander and Alliance councillor Noel Williams said: We are not talking jumbo jets going into Belfast International type lighting.Nine councillors voted in favour of the application with one against. The council#s solicitor stated that the correct procedure for dealing with objections had been applied.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signatures, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest Northern IrelandMan jailed for squirting accelerant on neighbourMan who assaulted nurse twice is sentencedSuspended sentence for one-punch attacker#I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Latest from Belfast Myanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positionsMarcelo Bielsa believes Pablo Hernandez still has a lot to offer Leeds,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mind you, sleep is a thing of the past...With hectic work schedules that saw Holly in England and Connor in Northern Ireland, the new parents are both finally in the same house, in the same country, at the same time.We missed each other a lot when she was in Manchester and I was in my Newry apartment broadcasting across the UK, he said.Then sometimes I had to go to Manchester and Holly was in Northern Ireland we were like ships in the night.She came home for maternity in the second week in December and we#ve been setting ourselves up since then now it genuinely feels like we#ve got there.They are now settled in their new house in Holywood, Co Down, during lockdown three of this pandemic, just an hour away from their supportive family network.The couple, who met when they were both working on the breakfast programme on Cool FM and got married in Portugal in , didn#t know in advance what gender the newborn would be.Connor confided that they actually thought it was going to be a girl.My best friend had a wee boy at the start of the first lockdown, my sister had a boy  weeks ago and one of our best friends, an Irish couple living in England, had a boy as well, he explained.We just thought the law of averages would suggest it was going to be a wee girl but no... out he popped with his big shovel hands!Being there for the birth was a special experience, although Covid- restrictions meant that Connor couldn#t visit Greyabbey native Holly went she was first admitted.I was literally sitting in the car park of the Ulster Hospital for two days, he said.We were actually communicating on FaceTime when Holly was told it was time...so I dashed inside to meet her around pm, and the wee man joined us at .pm.About  minutes later I had to leave, and I was told that my we would see me in two days. That was hard... I was sitting alone on the couch, missing my we and not getting to know my newborn.He has nothing but praise for the amazing staff at the Ulster whom he can#t thank enough.It is early days, but already Fionn has changed Connor#s perspective on le.The other day when I was out running and all I could think about was getting home to seethey were okay, he said, adding: That run was much faster than normal.He will soon be back at Broadcasting House in Belfast and is buzzing about touching base with the listeners on The Connor Phillips Show, which resumes this Monday following his spell on paternity leave.I#m lucky that I#ve never had that Monday feeling that a lot of people have with their jobs, he said.Then again, come Wednesday, I might be saying something dferent when I#m missing the wee man.Connor has made the prestigious mid-morning radio slot his own since last May, having become the long-term replacement of close friend Stephen Clements who died suddenly on January , .The pair had known each other since their Cool FM days, and stepping into Stephen#s shoes was a surreal, bittersweet experience.He had realised a dream by getting his own BBC show, but both he and Holly - who had worked with the -year-old father-of-two on Children in Need just weeks before his death - had lost a dear friend in tragic circumstances.That was a horrendous time, Connor said.It#s been just over a year since he died, but talking about it doesn#t get any easier.I#d known Stephen since . Holly had worked with him too and he was a good friend to both of us.The day he died... I#ll never forget how much it hit Holly. And me. It was awful. I can#t even imagine what his family went through.Perhaps part of Connor#s charm - and one of the reasons for his show#s success - is that he strives to keep his friend#s memory alive.I regularly pay tribute to Stephen, he said.We dedicated our th show in September to him and, on his anniversary we dedicated that show to Stephen as well.We#ll continue to do that, because it#s important that people don#t forget how brilliant a broadcaster he was, how wonderful a human being he was.There#s some great work being done in his name by the Stephen Clements Foundation.He added: It#s still tough to talk about it, but it#s important that we talk about any of the issues people may have. It#s important thatanyone is struggling, they know they can reach out and talk to people.Connor believes another reason for his show#s popularity is that he shares a lot of his predecessor#s style.When we worked on commercial radio, they used to be afraid to put us on at the same time because they#d be scared that we might say something a little risque, he said.Stephen had the same comic timing asGerry Anderson you never knew what he was going to say next.With little Hamilton-Phillips calling the shots right now, Connor doesn#t know when his we willto work but the unflappable duo will have plenty of volunteers when it comes to looking after the little one.We#ve got a great network of support, Connor said.My parents [Maureen and Terry] and Holly#s parents [Kim and David] and our families all live within an hour of us.They will need a little more childcareConnor realises his next ambition: to work with Holly on TV. He hopes that may happen this year.Neither of us were ever handed anything in our careers we#ve worked our backsides off, he said.We have a strong work ethic. We love what we do. We met doing the jobs that we do.We love each other because we have very similar personalities, and we always support each other.When asked about a little brother or sister for Fionn, Connor said he will be happy whatever happens.And, as the two-week-old bundle of joy continued to sleep blissfully in the background, the new father added: We just feel incredibly lucky to have this wee man with us.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadArrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Dynamics have changed, says DUP#s Foster on NI protocol benefits remarksLatest Northern IrelandMan jailed for squirting accelerant on neighbourMan who assaulted nurse twice is sentencedSuspended sentence for one-punch attackerLights sought for tiny airfield where planes were erted #I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Latest from Belfast Roy Hodgson: Top-half finish will be a tough ask for Crystal PalaceMyanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now he has decided to tackle the man he considers the greatest to have ever played the game.The book, which has the backing of the Best family, features wide-ranging interviews with George#s loved ones, team-mates and friends.The foreword is provided by George#s brother Ian and brother-in-law Norman McNarry.Much has been written about Best#s rise from the Cregagh estate to the top of the footballing world. The controversial star was followed by the media throughout his le, his every move documented in column inches. Mr Barton said he wanted to get away from the stories of drinking and womanising and concentrate on George Best the footballer. Best died as a result of alcoholism in November . Before his death he asked that people remember me for my football.I#ve talked to so many people while writing my other books, many of them tell stories about George Best, it#s just mesmeric from my point of view, said the author. I#m a United fan, I#ve seen all the tapes and everything of George, and I always felt that George was the best player we#ve ever had.I feltI was going to do something about him I#d have to come up with something dferent than everything that#s been written.I thought the one thing that was missing, as stupid as it sounds, was a book about George the footballer. He said he doesn#t shy away from the negative aspects of George#s le when it pertains to football.They are such prominent things in his le you can#t completely pretend that it doesn#t exist, that wouldn#t do his story justice, he explained.Mr Barton referred to the story of the hotel bellboy who delivered champagne to Best#s room and found him with a scantily-clad Miss World on a bed covered with his winnings from the casino. The bellboy asked Best: #Where did it all go wrong # Mr Barton said it has become a bit of a punch line, but he hopes to understand Best#s mindset.The writer said that during his research he discovered the true story behind the star#s exit from Old Trafford.He left the club in January  amid a turbulent season that saw United relegated just a few years after their  European Cup triumph. Mr Barton used information published in this newspaper at the time to uncover the story. It#s never been documented before, it#s been said he came into the stadium drunk, but I have found a lot of stuff that rubbishes that story and clears George#s name, he said.It#s dficult to say when it#s your own work, but I think it#s the biggest untold story in United history.My motivation was not only to tell the story about George, but make sure that I was being true to him. Rather than just telling a story about a famous player, I wanted to make sure I was being loyal to the way he would have wanted it to be told.With his birthday coming up I imagined the book would be a positive celebration of George#s le, and I think I#ve achieved that.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadArrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Dynamics have changed, says DUP#s Foster on NI protocol benefits remarksLatest Northern IrelandMan jailed for squirting accelerant on neighbourMan who assaulted nurse twice is sentencedSuspended sentence for one-punch attackerLights sought for tiny airfield where planes were erted #I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Latest from Belfast Roy Hodgson: Top-half finish will be a tough ask for Crystal PalaceMyanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last night Sir Tom#s memory was marked with a national clap.In Belfast, the Lord Mayor opened an online book of condolence.

He became the epitome of all that is good and noble about how we have come together in a common cause of defeating Covid and supporting our health service and our health workers, he said.However, a row broke out after Sinn Fein did not pay tribute during a meeting of Fermanagh and Omagh council.The Belfastcontacted Barry McElduff, the party#s group leader on the council, but he refused to comment.It drew criticism from DUP councillor Errol Thompson, who said: Captain Tom was someone who fundraised for our country as a whole and a lot of that funding came towards our own Trusts here. The Western Trust received £, from his efforts and the Southern Trust received £,. What a treasure he was. It is disappointing and I know other people who would call themselves nationalists or republicans actually did pay tribute.He added: They [SF] probably had their own reasons for doing it.During the meeting, Ulster Unionist councillor Victor Warrington said: The man was a great inspiration at the start of this pandemic, with his efforts of doing the walk to raise millions for the NHS. He had a great le of  years and would have had some great stories to tell. On behalf of my party, I want to express our sincere sympathies.This was followed by a tribute from Mr Thompson of the DUP.Independent councillor Emmet McAleer said: The money that Captain Sir Tom raised during his activities was absolutely inspiring.Independent councillor Josephine Deehan told members she was greatly saddened.Another independent, Donal O#Cofaigh, referred to Sir Tom#s inspirational efforts.SDLP councillor Paul Blake said he was a real inspiration, adding: We owe a great debt of gratitude.Yesterday, hours before a national clap in his memory took place, the House of Commons fell silent in tribute to Sir Tom.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the centenarian had dedicated his le to serving the needs of so many others. He said: We all now have the opportunity to show our appreciation for him and all that he stood for and believed in. That is why I encourage everyone to join in a national clap for Captain Tom and all those health workers for whom he raised money at pm this evening. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Captain Tom#s contribution - having raised more than £m for the NHS during the first coronavirus lockdown - will be formally marked, possibly with a statue.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signatures, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest Northern IrelandMan jailed for squirting accelerant on neighbourMan who assaulted nurse twice is sentencedSuspended sentence for one-punch attackerLights sought for tiny airfield where planes were erted #I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Latest from Belfast Thomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positionsMarcelo Bielsa believes Pablo Hernandez still has a lot to offer LeedsAndy Farrell urges Ireland to lay down Six Nations marker against Wales,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had enjoyed a chequered career in rock, playing with bands such as Thin Lizzy, Skid Row and G-Force, and as a solo artist collaborating with BB King among others. Gary#s sister Patricia , herself a musician, said she was taken aback by the support for the campaign after a concert to fundraise for the statue sold out in . It is thought the statue, for which almost £, has been raised by fans, could become a feature of a major cultural celebration in the city being planned for . Further concerts have been postponed because of the pandemic but she said the family and fan-led campaign will press on as soon as possible. We#ll get there, we#re not going to stop, she told the Belfast . There are so many people who bought tickets to the gig last year. We couldn#t believe the love for him.Ms Moore, who was  years younger than her famous brother, said she was his biggest fan. My main memories are of gigs, watching him play, which was just magical. I was eight years old when I first saw him play at Colston Hall. He was walking around holding my hand afterwards and it was just magical. I was in awe and people were asking for his autograph and he was signing people#s arms, she said. Although Ms Moore was born in Weston-super-Mare in England, she said she has great memories of a close-knit family of five children.He was so good to me as a brother, he used to phone me up when I was down and cheer me up, she said. Gary#s death came as a shock to his entire family, particularly his mother, she added. It will always hit a raw nerve. I listen to him every day, which my sister found hard for a long time but now she listens and that#s why we want the statue. Although Gary left Belfast at a young age, he had a great love of the city and his family there, she said.Green councillor Brian Smyth said he would welcome a statue of one of Belfast#s most famous musical sons. [He] has left a lasting legacy not only in Belfast, but across the planet. This is also a timely reminder of how important music is and how we value our musicians, when there is a real challenge to the arts sector in Northern Ireland.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signatures, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest Northern IrelandMan jailed for squirting accelerant on neighbourMan who assaulted nurse twice is sentencedSuspended sentence for one-punch attackerLights sought for tiny airfield where planes were erted #I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Latest from Belfast Roy Hodgson: Top-half finish will be a tough ask for Crystal PalaceMyanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said that she had received support from Alliance, Green, and People Before Profit councillors.I absolutely believe in the right to protest. I don#t think anybody should be persecuted or punished. But women who have suffered miscarriages, and their families, have a right to be protected from having to view such upsetting images in our city centre, she said. All groups, whatever they are campaigning on, should have to adhere to a certain code before they are allowed to set up stalls on streets.Ms Whearty, who runs Cafe Cuan in Belfast with husband John Paul, verbally challenged members of the anti-abortion group#s stall in an incident in Cornmarket in June . She was later charged with unlawfully assaulting Maria Maynes and Lucy Kelly. It happened after she went into town after giving birth to her son Flynn  weeks earlier. I saw these words #Abortion Won#t Unrape Her# and these shockingly graphic images of foetuses in ious stages of development, she said. I#d a miscarriage the year before I conceived Flynn, and it was a very protracted and bloody experience. Seeing those pictures on the stand in Cornmarket brought it all back to me. I felt completely overwhelmed. I had a heated discussion with those on the stall about the images. At one stage, it was alleged that I had spat at them. I categorically deny that.Two months later, I was charged with technical assault. I cannot fault the PSNI - they have a job to do, and they treated me with respect at all times. But I believe the PPS#s decision to prosecute was wrong.Ms Whearty, a frequent BBC NI commentator, lost all her broadcast work following the charges. I#ve been completely vindicated by the dismissal of the charges. I did nothing wrong. Belfast City Council needs to take action to set terms and conditions for those setting up stalls in the city centre.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signatures, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest Northern IrelandMan jailed for squirting accelerant on neighbourMan who assaulted nurse twice is sentencedSuspended sentence for one-punch attackerLights sought for tiny airfield where planes were erted #I#d love to have the school full of activity... the buzz has gone#Latest from Belfast Roy Hodgson: Top-half finish will be a tough ask for Crystal PalaceMyanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandThomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The current guidelines will continue to apply until such time as revised guidelines are approved, they added.Sipo also claried that a donation in kind still counts as a political donation under their rules. The matters referred to by the Seanad in its query, such as the conduct of research, provision of social media services or employment of staff funded in the north and employed in this jurisdiction, could potentially fall within the definition of donation.The report was sparked by a motion tabled by Fine Gael Senator Barry Ward asking that Sipo investigate the donation bequeathed to Sinn Fein in Mr Hampton#s will. Mr Ward raised concerns about Sinn Fein using the €m donation to fund activities in the South through its offices in Northern Ireland.I#m delighted Sipo recognised that Sinn Fein should make a clear statement on what their finances are and how the are spending it in both jurisdictions, Mr Ward said. However, I still have signicant questions about the €m donation, he added.A Sinn Fein spokesperson said: We will be happy to provide a consolidated version of these to Sipo when their guidelines are updated.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signatures, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest Republic of IrelandIreland now ‘best in Europe’ at suppressing third waveJournalist threatened after probe into KinahanOrder demands axe of protocol as DUP petition reaches ,BBC Panorama team threatened following Kinahan programmeLatest from Belfast Thomas Tuchel not looking ahead in Champions League chasePep Guardiola expects response from wounded LiverpoolJurgen Klopp hopes new defenders can release midfielders back to best positionsMarcelo Bielsa believes Pablo Hernandez still has a lot to offer LeedsAndy Farrell urges Ireland to lay down Six Nations marker against Wales,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The site has lain empty since  but in recent days trees and weeds that had grown over time were removed. A planning application was previously lodged for the construction of  residential apartments which will comprise of  one bed and  two bed apartments. The site was granted outline planning approval but there is an application before the council for ‘Reserved Matters’ - aspects of a proposed development which an applicant can choose not to submit details of initially. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, full planning permission has not been granted at this stage. If approved, people will be able to gain access to the apartments from Foyle Roadand John Street.  There will also be a ground floor parking area that can accommodate  cars. The accommodation is viewed as a good location for non-car use and car ownership will be being actively discouraged at the site. A Travel Plan will be promoted by a ‘Travel Coordinator’ who will promote other forms of transport. A document accompanying the application, states: “The measures will encourage the use of sustainable modes, reduce dependence on the car and therefore contribute to reduced car growth in car journeys, increase the use of healthier alternatives such as walking and cycling, and contributing towards making a safer, healthier environment around the development.” googletag.cmd.push A report also highlights the servicing arrangements for the building which sits close to the bottom deck of the Craigavon Bridge. It identies the challenges posed by vehicles collecting or delivering goods to the apartments but deems these activities to be ‘low-impact’, aside from removal vehicles, which was categorised as ‘medium impact’ – but something that will happen ‘once a year’. The site was formerly occupied by Hamilton  Sons factory which was demolished in . At the time there were concerns about the stability of the building, which had been derelict for years. Foyle Civic Trust was disappointed by the decision, saying that everything should be done to save the industrial heritage of the city.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Extremely quiet. The other places Ive visited have been quiet, but not to this extent. Just like it takes your eyes a while to adjust to new light,you wait long enough, things come into focus. A Claudy Fuels lorry roars past and when it clears, there is movement. A young boy in Banagher gear emerges from the Spar shop clutching a plastic bag. He hasnt far to go, and with a quick look either way, darts across the road and disappears into a house on Feeny Road. At its heart, Feenys main thoroughfare is a residential street, and the people who live there are staying at home. googletag.cmd.push Walking up the hill towards the GAA pitch, the sun briefly illuminates figures at windows. An elderly man squints against the sun as he peers out his window. I catch glimpses of home-schooled children appearing at the windows as I make my way past. The distinctive air brake of the bin lorry comes at regular intervals. One woman rushes from her house with a bin in tow, spinning it on the kerb before retreating back into her home. Covid- messaging on the gates of Fr McNally Park. Smoke from internal fires wafts through the air as I reach Fr McNally Park, where the sun is breaking through the haze to create a spectacular backdrop. googletag.cmd.push The pitch is the first place of note you reach when you enter Feeny. It acts almost as a gatekeeper for the village, but its own gates are open. There dont appear to be any walkers on the grounds though, and I head back towards the centre of the village, where cars are parked around its hub the pharmacy, supermarket and chippy. A man stops me in the pharmacy car park, askingI know where he can find the boy that does the tarmac – McCloskey. Its as near to the needle in a haystack conundrum as you will find. I wish him luck.     Outside Feeny pharmacy, a makesht shelter has been erected to facilitate a socially distanced queue, but there is none today. Local pharmacist Declan Bateson believes people are taking things seriously. Owner Declan Bateson tells me this lockdown has been much quieter than its predecessors. “After Christmas, its been quieter. People are taking it seriously and have seen the surge in the hospitals,” says the  All-Ireland winner. “In the run-up to Christmas it was very busy. Retail shops were closed for a while and with the pharmacy being allowed to stay open, it meant we were busier. “GPs have tightened up who can come and theyve had a lot less people going through their doors, which means a lot more people coming through ours.” The pharmacy is at the centre of the village, both physically and metaphorically. Although he brushes off the notion of a pastoral role with modesty, its clear this is the case. “With the elderly living alone and feeling a lot more isolated, we are one of their few points of contact,” he says. “We know everybody who comes into the shop, we know their families and we can ask after them. Were part of the community. “We do try and reach out and have those chats, seethey are doing okay, orwere delivering to them we can have a chat on the doorstep and see how theyre keeping. “Its always felt that way though. Its a small village, there are a couple of pubs, a local shop with the post office, ourselves and the doctors. “The pubs have been closed and the doctors have been less available, so ourselves and the shop next door have probably been pivotal in keeping people going.” All over, this lockdown has been very dferent to its initial version last Spring. Covid has come creeping in to the Feeny community like many across Ireland. “We got lucky the first time round, there were no surges here, but in September and October you began to see local people testing positive. Reality dawned on people that this was serious,” he says. “The lockdown before Christmas frustrated a lot of people, but in hindsight it was a mistake to let things open up again in the run-up to Christmas. Its cost lives. “We would have had the odd doubter of Covid coming in during the summer months, but we dont seem to have them coming in any more.” Wise words greet customers at Sizzles in Feeny. Next door, in Sizzles chippy, they are cleaning in preparation for the evenings business. The door is open for ventilation when I askanyone is around to speak. Grainne plays the role of gatekeeper, listening to my reasons for disrupting their Thursday afternoon, before owner Marlene appears from the kitchen, satisfied with my explanation. “There is no fortune being made, but at least were surviving and looking forward to getting back to normal,” she tells me. “You always worry, because you think will this week be okay  Its stressful for anybody, but I feel sorry for people in the restaurant game. “I always want to work, but sometimesthe government says you cant, then you cant. Youre always concerned about your staff and customers.” Marlene echoes Declans analysis of how the virus has crept up on the people of the village. “At the start it didnt really sink in, until people started to get unwell. You just didnt want to see loved ones get taken to hospital and you were watching horror stories on the news of it being fatal,” she says. “The summer was great because you were home early in the evenings and there was nice weather. Its tough now on peoples mental health, trying to stay positive. “Since the schools closed, its hard for childcare as well. It affects the whole community, but keeping going is important.” There is a big push to improve broadband in the area at present. It is clear the business owners in the centre of Feeny feel a wider responsibility than simply providing a service. Marlene says its hard to lt peoples spirits in such emotionally sanitised circumstances. “Everybody expresses theyre fed up, and were all in the one boat, but you cant spend a lot of time because we can only allow one person in at a time,” she said. “It removes that bit of banter between people, but thats the times were in. You still have people who want to come in and stand and you feel bad askingyou can bring it out to them.” “If one of us went down though, thats the whole team down and it has a knock-on effect.” Birds are dancing back and forth across the Feeny Road as I make my way back towards the car. I note the name of the pub – Sperrin View. I take a moment to savour it, looking down Glenedra Road as the sun breaks over the Sperrins. Its a pity no one will be able to experience it for a while. On the way back out the road, I stop off at Banagher Glen, on the off chance any walkers want to share their lockdown experience. Im halfway down the narrow road when Im waved down by two perplexed looking men standing outside a van. “Do you knowThomas Murphys gravel pit is anywhere round here ” asks one of them. I shake my head. Its probably time I went home.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over £, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.- Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Oisin Moran,Derry,StirlingGAA,Scotland,Aaron Conway\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In part two of our look at the Derry influence on Stirling University, Michael McMullan looked into the experiences of Magherafelt man Oisin Moran and Craigbanes Aaron Conway as they kept the club on track.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary.

The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over £, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.- Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Oisin Moran,Derry,StirlingGAA,Scotland,Aaron Conway\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In part two of our look at the Derry influence on Stirling University, Michael McMullan looked into the experiences of Magherafelt man Oisin Moran and Craigbanes Aaron Conway as they kept the club on track.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary.

As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over pound, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.  - Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This column also feels there would be some mileage in Prentys thoughts, which he said would stop what he called the runaway train that is the inter-county game. While he cites costs as one of his reasons, and it is an issue, I think a more streamlined county scene would allow club and county to dovetail nicely together. googletag.cmd.push Albeit forced on us by Covid-, the split season has already been a great move by fixture chiefs in the association. It enables club and county to have their dedicated piece of the pie, something Shane McGuigan outlined in a recent interview. It allowed players, in his experience, to be fully in the room when the county or club is taking preference. No more would it be a case of just having one eye on the prize at stake. And the club game delivered by the lorry load. It offered a product that the national print and broadcast media embraced. Club players were now front and centre. Just as they should be. googletag.cmd.push On the county scene, we will park the overusedDublin are miles ahead narrative for now. The  season gave us Cavan, a story that so many of us can be inspired by. But with a shortened championship, it allowed us to escape the kerfuffle of the Super s. However, we paid the price with two landslide semi-finals. Tyrone, Donegal, Galway, Cork or Kerry would have added more substance to the last four hands grasping for Sam Maguire. Its up to them to get themselves back out of their province. Until Leinster can get back to the level Dublin are at, we are always going to have a lopsided championship.     Thats why I feel John Prentys thoughts need proper consideration. Its time the GAA took a truthful look in the mirror. And reflect where it will be in five years time. Almost five years ago now, I had a conversation with a club manager. One of those off the record what do you think of the game type of chats. As we tried to put the world to right, he said one thing that summed up our conversation. We agreed that an All-Ireland winning manager lting the lid on his teams path to success, revealing just two collective training sessions per week as the core to their championship fine-tuning would be a game-changer. It wouldnt be long until every manager would follow suit. The sheep mentality in us latches onto winning trends. Kieran Donaghy was in the inter-county wilderness, a midfielder on the fringes of Kerrys starting , until Jack OConnor threw him in at full-forward during a qualier game against Longford. It worked a treat, in that Jack had the players to leave the ball hanging over his head and make him the ideal target-man. Donaghy became highly effective in Kerrys system. Soon club managers were throwing every big man they would find, not making the cut at midfield, onto the fringe of the square. Players were put in goals for their kicking accuracy to be the next Cluxton. After Alex Fergusons use of super subs Sheringham and Solskjaer to land the  Champions League, certain players were soon called impact men, left on the bench so a manager could finish with a stronger team when he started when the defenders legs began to tire. People are easily influenced. Mick ODwyer and Kevin Heffernan always ramped their training upthey lost out to each other in the s tussles between the teams. ODwyer was reported to have trained the Kerry team  days in a row, to find an edge. Thats why it would be a breath of fresh airDublin and Limerick, the GAAs current benchmark, were to strip back their management teams and train collectively for two pitch sessions a week. With an increase in the number of gyms in clubs across Ireland on the up, would it not make better sense for county players to conduct their strength and conditioning work among their grass-roots. Counties who have invested a small fortune developing state of the art facilities will be pulling their hair out, but there are benefits to be had from a change in tact. Firstly, it would save the county board an extra couple of nights of travelling and feeding expenses. The players would have a greater bond with their club, who have spent money to kit out their facilities. Every county player would be given a programme to follow and be tested at ious key intervals. Lets face it, the players who really want to succeed will follow the plan. They could even educate their club friendship group on the basics, so there is a trickle down effect. And they can revolve the gym session around their work, family and getting home to watch Liverpool or Man United slug it out on the telly. The multiple lock-downs have shown us that video analysis meetings could all be done remotely via zoom. Counties could streamline feedback to last shorter and done from the players sofa. All of a sudden, the inter-county scene – while still offering a high level of preparation – is no longer equivalent to a second job, with the amount of travel and collective time a player has to commit to. Imagine this was of Peter Keanes tale after Kerry could manage to win Sam later this year and everyone followed. It would leave team expenses more manageable to county treasurers. Players would be able to fit in study, a family le and overtime at work. If this was the case, would the sixMayo players have retired  I think it would allow players to have a longer playing career, it would mean that less players would be fast-tracked in from minors. It would allow students to get a proper crack at playing for their Fresher and Sigerson teams. The club and county U competitions would find a proper home. As a result, the inter-county game would be closer to the amateur side of the scale than elite. The knock-on is having a better balance all round – both in the countys bank account and the players lestyle. And they will still get the buzz when they run out to test themselves against the best every other county has to offer. I have never met John Prenty, but I like his idea. It makes so much sense.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this article, he pays tribute to his friend and former colleague, Doctor Tom McGinley, who died last week. --------------------------------------------- Recent days saw the passing of a greatly loved and appreciated ‘son’ of the city. Though a deeply sad time for his family and the many thousands who benefited from his prolonged services to the terminally ill and their families, it is also a time, soon, to begin to celebrate the le of someone who will, it can be said, never be forgotten, and whose legacy is very personal to many. googletag.cmd.push When the book, BUILDING BRIDGES, the story of Foyle Hospice, was launched in December  it was dedicated to the people of the north-west corner of Ireland who have, in myriad ways, contributed to the success of Foyle Hospice to Dr Tom McGinley without whom it could not exist, and to Deirdre, his beloved we, whose wholehearted support allowed him the time and the space to fulfil his dream. Tom always related the ongoing success to the ‘people’ who generously donated and volunteered in many ways. Every great project starts with a ‘thought’, a ‘dream’you will. But how many have the driving force, the determination, as well as the time and energy to make that dream come true  Very few I guess. googletag.cmd.push Tom was one, who forced his way through all challenges, not without pain himself. Many were the ups and downs. The challenge was triggered when, in the ’s as a GP in a large and busy City Practice, he was treating a young man terminally ill with bone cancer. Morphine was considered a very dangerous drug which could not be given too frequently. Tom realised that treating those with a terminal illness was not easy or advanced in those days. This problem sank into his soul and, while still working as a full-time GP, he decided to study anaesthetics to learn about pain control.     By the end of the s and into the ’s he suddenly heard that the new Northern Hospice was raising money in the North-west. He said “We need a hospice – and we need it now.” The pace picked up rapidly. He founded the Foyle Female Five a race for ladies which raised many thousands of pounds. A small steering committee was started, by Tom and myself in the autumn of  which was soon joined by Dr Ailbie Bierne, Hugh McElhinny, Ken Goodall, and Grainne Nugent. An official Guildhall launch took placein January  with a goal to raise pound, - .  A centre was bought in Crawford Square and a Home Care Service started in . Fund-raising accelerated and the search for a suitable site was the next huge step. This was to support the home-care with ‘inpatient back-up beds’. Tom agreed that the Foyle Bridge should be the symbol for the hospice – which assisted patients and their families across three bridges, the one between le and death, the one that traversed the border between North and South, and the one which broke barriers between Catholic and Protestant. He was firmly told by a priest at the time, that the new hospice had to be Catholic in character, while a Protestant group complained that it would be too nationalist. We secretly decided one night to build it in the middle of the bridge! The triumphant goal of opening the Inpatient Unit came on a Thursday in June . A large group from all levels of society were invited – too many to accommodate inside. Prayers were said to prevent rain. Well, it did rain on the Monday, the Tuesday, the Wednesday, but on the Thursday the sun shone all day. Radio Foyle broadcast the ceremony live. On the Friday it rained again! A problem had reared its head prior to the opening. The decision to ask someone to ‘cut the ribbon’ was not an easy one, as you would guess. Would we ask a politician  A church leader  A film star  Given the social milieu we all lived in, the task was not easy. The perfect solution suddenly occurred. Tom agreed would invite two children, whose mothers had passed away from cancer. One was a Catholic and the other a Protestant. They would cut the ribbon together.  Since then the hospice has grown, the virgin gardens have bloomed more beautully every year. The services of the Hospice have expanded and developed. In  a new day centre was opened onsite, expanding services yet again. The fund-raising centre was also on-site, headed by Ciaran McGinley. Towards the end of , Dr McGinley felt that due to health reasons he must step down. The Board reluctantly accepted his decision and fully appreciated his reasons. Tom had dreamed a dream. He had become the driving force towards founding the Foyle Hospice. He had been Medical Director, chairman of the Board as well as acting as CEO. History has been made, his accolades well earned. Tom was awarded a Papal Knighthood for his work, received Freedom of the City, and many other awards. There is a statue placed close to the path between St Columb’s Park and the Foyle Bridge right beside the courageous flier, Amelia Earhart. More than all of these awards, however, are the thoughts and prayers of those many thousands of patients and families who, over many decades, have benefited from the services of a dream come true. The poem, Ulysses, by Alfred Lord Tennyson, ends with the following: “To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.” Tomaacutes McGinley gave us a dream, and then left it with us.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tom always related the ongoing success to the ‘people’ who generously donated and volunteered in many ways. Every great project starts with a ‘thought’, a ‘dream’you will. But how many have the driving force, the determination, as well as the time and energy to make that dream come true  Very few I guess. googletag.cmd.push Tom was one, who forced his way through all challenges, not without pain himself. Many were the ups and downs. The challenge was triggered when, in the ’s as a GP in a large and busy City Practice, he was treating a young man terminally ill with bone cancer. Morphine was considered a very dangerous drug which could not be given too frequently. Tom realised that treating those with a terminal illness was not easy or advanced in those days. This problem sank into his soul and, while still working as a full-time GP, he decided to study anaesthetics to learn about pain control.     By the end of the s and into the ’s he suddenly heard that the new Northern Hospice was raising money in the North-west. He said “We need a hospice – and we need it now.” The pace picked up rapidly. He founded the Foyle Female Five a race for ladies which raised many thousands of pounds. A small steering committee was started, by Tom and myself in the autumn of  which was soon joined by Dr Ailbie Bierne, Hugh McElhinny, Ken Goodall, and Grainne Nugent. An official Guildhall launch took placein January  with a goal to raise pound, - .  A centre was bought in Crawford Square and a Home Care Service started in . Fund-raising accelerated and the search for a suitable site was the next huge step. This was to support the home-care with ‘inpatient back-up beds’. Tom agreed that the Foyle Bridge should be the symbol for the hospice – which assisted patients and their families across three bridges, the one between le and death, the one that traversed the border between North and South, and the one which broke barriers between Catholic and Protestant. He was firmly told by a priest at the time, that the new hospice had to be Catholic in character, while a Protestant group complained that it would be too nationalist. We secretly decided one night to build it in the middle of the bridge! The triumphant goal of opening the Inpatient Unit came on a Thursday in June . A large group from all levels of society were invited – too many to accommodate inside. Prayers were said to prevent rain. Well, it did rain on the Monday, the Tuesday, the Wednesday, but on the Thursday the sun shone all day. Radio Foyle broadcast the ceremony live. On the Friday it rained again! A problem had reared its head prior to the opening. The decision to ask someone to ‘cut the ribbon’ was not an easy one, as you would guess. Would we ask a politician  A church leader  A film star  Given the social milieu we all lived in, the task was not easy. The perfect solution suddenly occurred. Tom agreed would invite two children, whose mothers had passed away from cancer. One was a Catholic and the other a Protestant. They would cut the ribbon together.  Since then the hospice has grown, the virgin gardens have bloomed more beautully every year. The services of the Hospice have expanded and developed. In  a new day centre was opened onsite, expanding services yet again. The fund-raising centre was also on-site, headed by Ciaran McGinley. Towards the end of , Dr McGinley felt that due to health reasons he must step down. The Board reluctantly accepted his decision and fully appreciated his reasons. Tom had dreamed a dream. He had become the driving force towards founding the Foyle Hospice. He had been Medical Director, chairman of the Board as well as acting as CEO. History has been made, his accolades well earned. Tom was awarded a Papal Knighthood for his work, received Freedom of the City, and many other awards. There is a statue placed close to the path between St Columb’s Park and the Foyle Bridge right beside the courageous flier, Amelia Earhart. More than all of these awards, however, are the thoughts and prayers of those many thousands of patients and families who, over many decades, have benefited from the services of a dream come true. The poem, Ulysses, by Alfred Lord Tennyson, ends with the following: “To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.” Tomaacutes McGinley gave us a dream, and then left it with us.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans involved the construction of  houses at a riverside site at Rossbay off the Limavady Road. Residents in the area had raised a large number of concerns in relation to the plans, including road safety and congestion issues. The plans were first submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning department in . They involved the proposed construction of  houses and eight bungalows on the land overlooking the River Foyle. After detailed examinations, the councils planning department recommended that the plans be approved. googletag.cmd.push However, the final say on planning applications rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and there was a y discussion on the plans for the Rossbay site. Representatives for local residents opposed to the development and the company behind the housing plans were given the opportunity to address the meeting. The meeting was told that although  objections had been received in relation to the plans, they involved multiple submissions from  properties in the surrounding area. This was the largest number of objections that the council has ever received in relation to a planning application. googletag.cmd.push After the ious arguments were put forward at todays meeting, DUP councillor Hilary McClintock proposed that the committee go against the recommendation of the councils planning department and refuse permission for the Waterside development. Her proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and supported unanimously by all the councillors who were eligible to vote at the meeting. If so wished, the developer can now appeal the councils decision through the Planning Appeals Commission.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Magherafelt-based Stephen Atherton, of John J McNally  Co Solicitors, has taken a judicial review into the restrictions on behalf of an eight-year-old footballer. The decision was taken after the Department conceded Mr Atherton had an arguable case. Signicant progress was made today in our challenge against the continued prohibition on children’s outdoor sport, said Mr Atherton. At the th hour, lawyers acting on behalf of the Department of Health conceded that we have presented an arguable case before the Court and the challenge will now move to a full expedited hearing on March . googletag.cmd.push While pursuing the review, Mr Atherton has again called on the Executive to lt the restrictions on youth sport immediately. Whilst we are obviously delighted at this development, we are acutely aware that the current restrictions imposed by the Executive, at the behest of the Department of Health, are inflicting signicant physical and emotional harm on children, particularly in the absence of school attendance, he said. Accordingly we call on the NI Executive to allow all children toimmediately to the sporting arena, where they will find comfort, challenge and respite in physical exertion and the company of their friends. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He had a terric interest in football, not only of Glen and Derry, but further afield and attended All-Ireland finals in Croke Park. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the passing of Freddie Joe Tohill,” read a statement on the clubs Facebook page. Glen committee members at the  All-Ireland Final in Dublin : Danny McKenna, Pat Convery, Freddie Joe Tohill and Frances Kielt googletag.cmd.push “Freddie Joe was our oldest living past player. He served us well, both as a player and Club Officer. Condolences to his family at this sad time. A le very well lived. Ar dheis Deacute go raibh a anam uasal.” The comments below the message tells the story of his legacy. One word cropped up time and time again – gentleman. At Mondays requiem mass, streamed live from St Patricks Glen, Parish Priest Father Paddy Doherty spoke of the many many people who wouldve been present, only for the current Covid- restrictions. Fr Doherty also thanked those who sang. It was fitting, as Freddie was a great singer and a member of the choir. googletag.cmd.push His talents didnt end there, he had a tremendous interest in local drama. He was regularly involved in plays and pantomimes when Magheras National Hall was in its pomp. Freddie Joe was the beloved husband of the late Annie Elizabeth and loving father of Terence, Fred, Anne and Maureen, and a dear brother of Noel and the late Sean, Colm and Maureen. He was brought up in Maghera, at the corner of Main Street and the Coleraine Road. There, his father Fred had a butchers shop and Freddie Joe, with his brother Sean, learned their trade. Freddie Joe then took over the shop, which was later moved to Upper Main Street, on the site of Eurospar, where it stood until its closure.     He was very popular in the community and among the other business owners in the town. On the field, in the shop and throughout the community, Freddie Joe was popular. His le was one that was well lived.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Fitzsimons is well-known for his walking tours in this area.ldquoI came up with the idea of doing the coastal path and following the pilgrim path to the holy well, he said.ldquoThe reason we did that was because of the outstanding natural beauty that is there.

A number of residents were also forced to leave their homes.The mortar was discovered at the side of a busy road close to the entrance to Tievenadarragh Wood and after it was inspected by Army Technical Officers and declared safe, the device was taken away for detailed forensic examination.A number of politicians have expressed concern that this is the third device of its kind linked to dissident republicans which has been discovered in the area over the past two years.Previous devices linked to the terror group have been discovered just a few miles from Seaforde at the Priestrsquos Road and Drumcaw Road near Clough.PSNI District Commander, Superintendent Norman Haslett, has confirmed that the device discovered at the Newcastle Road was a suspected component part of a mortar, but did not contain any explosives.He said that while it was too early to attribute ownership to any particular grouping, he believed that dissident republican terrorists were responsible.Mr Haslett said the matter remained under investigation and appealed for anyone who can assist police with their enquiries to get in contact with them.Politicians have roundly condemned those responsible for leaving the device at the side of one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis, said there was no justication for the actions of those responsible.Mr McGrath described the discovery of the mortar component as ldquovery concerning and said the repercussions of the weekend incident could have been devastating.He declared: Such devices are a thing of our past and have no place in our modern country. The inconvenience and impact of this incident on the local community will be considerable and I condemn those that placed that device.ldquoThe fact that the Newcastle Road had to be closed for a number of hours last Saturday evening is both infuriating and depressing. Infuriating because some iniduals wish to bring violence upon us and depressing at the thought of what might have come to pass,the device had not been found and dealt with.Mr McGrath, who thanked the emergency services for their swt response to the security alert, said those responsible ldquohave nothing to offer our society and are utterly contemptible.Condemning those responsible for the ldquodisruptive security alert, Ms Rogan described what happened as ldquoreckless activity.She declared: ldquoThe arearsquos district police commander has confirmed that a component part of a mortar device was found which could have been more sinister. Whoever was responsible for leaving this device and causing this disruption has shown complete disregard for the local community. There can be no justication for this type of reckless activity and those responsible need to cease these futile acts.Cllr Lewis said leaving a device at the side of the road ldquodemonstrates the stupidity of those responsible.He declared: ldquoTerrorism always finds a cause to attach itself and those seeking to ignite chaos and mayhem should reflect on the long-term realities of their aims. Tit-for-tat violence reenergises age-old conflict and no one will benefit from rising tension and public disorder.ldquoThose responsible are Neanderthals, plastic soldiers with romantic fantasies of days gone by. Just what are they trying to achieve Cllr Lewis said residents were ldquorightly alarmed at what happened last weekend, confirming that he is angry that a third mortar-type device has now been found in this part of the district in the past two years.He added: ldquoIt is time for the police to act. I want to see searches, investigations and arrests. I fear that dissident republicans are armed and dangerous and weapons in the hands of those who lack intelligence could quite possibly result in the loss of le.ldquoThis is  not  and those behind this incident need to pack up and go home.

This was the easiest one we could do in terms of social distancing, something which people and families could do together safely.Suzanne, who is a keen runner, has been a member of the Glees for many years, starting off with juniors.ldquoAround  people have signed up for the fundraiser to date and we would be delightedothers would come on board to join us, she continued. ldquoPeople have to do something every day, that is why we chose February as it is the shortest month.ldquoWe have set a target of pound, but did not knowthat was unrealistic or not, but are delighted with the support that we have received to date. We only started on Monday and the support from members and families has been unbelievable. Parents of the Junior Glees are also on board andwe pass our target that we be fantastic.The Junior Glees provided a virtual performance before the end of last year which was headed up by Society members Emma Nugent and Emma-Jane McKnight and was warmly received.ldquoOur committee has been working tirelessly to try and put something in place as the Society is under so much pressure as we canrsquot perform. We are responsible for looking after and maintaining the Annesley Hall and have applied for a few grants which we hope will come though, said Suzanne.ldquoLong before we ever get to the stage of starting rehearsing again we have a lot of work to do including providing sanitising stations and temperature check equipment, while all sinks will have to be replaced to include automatic taps. We also have to provide new auditorium seating, which can be wiped down, and hope we can secure grant money to cover these costs.Suzanne said the February fundraiser will be used to cover the hallrsquos day-to-day running and maintenance costs and that every penny raised will be put to good use.She continued: ldquoWe hope that by the end of the year we will be back in the hall. We are going to push as hard as we can to ensure that we can go back and that the required changes have been made and the hall will be ready.ldquoIt is our plan that we will have all the work that is required completed by the end of the summer so we can hit the ground running. That is why we have applied for grants and launched our fundraising initiative.Suzanne said the dream is to have the hall open again and the Glees rehearsing.She added: ldquoWe may even be able to stage concerts that we have pre-prepared before and perform before small audiences but will have to wait and seethere will be restrictions in terms of audience numbers. At this stage, no one knows.ldquoIt would be amazing to have the hall open again and performing in front of audiences and we would like to think we would be performing shows by Christmas,not sooner.Society members, friends or families, including the Gleesrsquo junior company, who wish to take part are asked to contact Suzanne on  .She added: ldquoWe are asking that as many people please take part at their own pace and have friends and family sponsor them or donate what they can.ldquoWe have created a JustGiving page to share on social media s and would ask people to share their photos or maps of their routes each day to raise awareness, posting on their own social media pages and the Glee Singers Facebook page.Anyone wishing to support the Newcastle Glees with their February fundraiser are asked to visit their JustGiving page at https:www.justgiving crowdfunding newcastleglees.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-Providing.jpg","title":"Providing special needs teaching during lockdown  ","story":"A SPECIAL needs teacher has used the lockdown to create a unique woodland play and outdoor classroom for children who benefit from a range of sensory experiences.Judith Riddell is behind the Empowering Little Minds consultancy in Drumaness and is currently working on a one to one basis outdoors with children with special needs, particularly boys and girls with autism.With the help and support of her husband David, Judith has worked since last March to create a unique and stimulating outdoor woodland classroom that was specically designed to provide a tailored approach to each child.Children aged from three up to  can explore a range of sensory activities on Judithrsquos private woodland and find out what helps them calm down and get to a place where they are able to learn and interact better.The desire to work one to one with children in an outdoor setting has become more important as the former teacher at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick adapted her business to suit lockdown restrictions.ldquoI had to mody my whole business since the first lockdown after I had self-funded creating my indoor classroom, explained Judith. ldquoI look on it as a positive spin-off from the lockdown as I was closed for nine months. It was something in the back of my mind to do but lockdown made me do it a lot earlier.She started up her consultancy business just over a year ago and has had to ldquothink outside the box since last March when social distancing became a new norm in the pandemic.ldquoWhen I first started the business, I wanted to empower children and their parents who would get an extra boost of some specialised training from me, she said. ldquoSometimes itrsquos hard for children to get all of their educational needs fully met in school.ldquoWhen I work one to one with them, itrsquos amazing to see their progress, even in such a short space of time. You see them really start to fly once their sensory system calms down and they are ready to take in information.Challenged by how she could still run her business during lockdown, Judith decided to put the eight acres of woodland she and her husband owns around their Crawfordstown Road home to good use.ldquoWe took over one acre and created the woodland classroom which can be accessed by a lot of willow structures that I created myself. Therersquos a massive tree house, things to swing on and climb on for the children to enjoy before they go into the woodland classroom which has everything an indoor classroom would have, she said.ldquoItrsquos actually great for both parents and children as they can listen to the birds and enjoy the woodland while their children are involved in learning activities.Judith has  years of experience of education special needs children after graduating from Cambridge University.ldquoI was always passionate about working with children with special needs and when I came back home I was fortunate enough to start working in Knockevin rather than starting in primary schools which I fully expected to do, said Judith.ldquoAfter a while I went to work in Bahrain to set up a school for special needs children on a three-year contract. I came back home just as things began to kick off in the Arab Spring and ed to work at Knockevin.ldquoI decided to set up my own practice in  as it was time to give some empowerment to parents as well as children. It gave me a chance to work with all aspects of a childrsquos development rather than working with one class for the whole year.Judith specialises in working with children aged -. She is also a training consultant for parents to help them understand their childrenrsquos sensory needs and working with staff from health organisations.Judith explained that while working with children with special needs is more complex and involves eight senses mdash not the five senses that we are all more familiar with mdash it can be very rewarding.ldquoAny child whorsquos born does not come with a training book, said Judith. ldquoSpecial needs children have very specic needs and you need to be able to read them in order to cater for that need.ldquoWith the coaching style I use, itrsquos about empowering parents to understand which sensory need their child needs to be fulfilled. With special needs children, you have to fill up with their sensory cup with all eight senses before they can start to learn, When the three extra senses are stimulated, they can be super-calming for everyone but particularly for children who canrsquot communicate their needs.ldquoWhen I coach parents, I explain about the three other senses, and tell what Irsquom doing and why Irsquom doing it to calm their child so that they then can keep using the same strategies at home. As the child learns to self-regulate more, the strategies change and the child is helped along the way.Despite having the space to accommodate more children after lockdown and when group activities are allowed again, Judith is focussed in developing her consultancy with the child always in mind.ldquoThe whole essence of the business is that it does not become a massive enterprise, she stressed.ldquoItrsquos about providing a more quiet, intimate area for the children so that they can feel safe and secure and itrsquos not overly busy. While I can expand and offer more sessions as the days gets longer, the woodland classroom will never be too busy.For further information visit www.empoweringlittleminds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-NewcastleSPORT.jpg","title":"Royal County Down comes out top  ","story":"ROYAL County Down has been recognised as the most picturesque golf course in the world.The famed Newcastle links came out on top of a study by the Surprise Shop website, which looked at  of the most stunning courses from around the world.The  found that Royal County Down was the subject of , Instagram posts.

Please try again later.Submitting...Back then Ulster had industries not only to protect but ones that were a cause for envy, a feat made all the more remarkable considering our land’s lack of natural resources in terms of steel and coal. Now, these industries have been replaced by others. Perhaps neither as impressive nor as lucrative as the iron-wroughts of the past but still they are a source of daily bread. However, for people such as myself this source is now at risk. Whomever was tasked with representing Northern Ireland’s interests at the Brexit trade talks saw fit to acquiesce in Northern Ireland’s removal from the single market for services. In layman’s terms this means that contractors, freelancers, specialists and consultants who have their practices based in Northern Irelandare potentially barred from trading in the EU . If this comes to pass then I will have to take my practice out of Northern Ireland and base it in a country that can allow me to work with the EU . Though not immediately apparentit will certainly be felt by those whom manage my affairs in Northern Ireland and of course Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will no longer be entitled to its percentage of my company’s earnings. This act could be replicated a thousandfold as northern based consultants have to move their admin where. I would ask that those who claim to stand for NI’s best interests go back to the drawing board and see to it that NI can be re-inserted into the single market for services. Rather than being a place that consultants will have to relocate from NI could instead become a place that consultants relocate to, as such a development would not escape the attention of consultants and service providers in GB who find themselves similarly cut off from EU work. Surely it is in our interests to have thousands of companies set up shop in Northern Ireland, pay tax here and utilise local services  There needs to be more examination of the actual consequences of our Brexit arrangements and proposals rather than acting out of blind zeal, which, I fear, has been the guiding hand of too many of those involved. If people find themselves more easily moved by rhetoric and fervour rather than daily bread issues then perhaps they could honourably choose to stand aside in favour of those whose vision is less clouded  Neale Weir, Castledawson, Co Londonderry——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I would categorise the album’s genre as a kind of mix between indie folk and dream pop. “The title ‘Destroyer’ came from a personal point of view. Depression and mental health is a big theme on the album and intends to allude to the idea of one’s own worst enemy who causes their own problems - your own destroyer.”Abraham’s Daughter was released in May  to much acclaim in the Belfast music scene and Conn also has some classical piano compositions and short film scores under his belt to date.“I take inspiration from a lot of dferent musical styles such as my background in classical and jazz piano, but my main influences now would include David Bowie, Sufjan Stevens, Phoebe Bridgers and Fiona Apple.”For the self-produced album, the versatile former Larne Grammar School pupil had to teach himself how to record, mix and master the audio for its release. “It was completed in just over a month, save for the two tracks recorded in March for the Abraham’s Daughter EP which reappear on this album, which was recorded by my university classmate Lewis Murray.”The experience of playing the piano for nearly two decades - including successes at Larne Music Festival - and performing at classical concerts across Northern Ireland should also stand Conn in good stead as he pursues his dream during the pandemic.---Click here to read: Larne musician’s new stage show for when the curtains go back up.--Thank you for reading this article.

It’s obviously feeding this public and political concern with the agreement.”When askedhe blamed ministers for that, he said: “Ministers, politicians generally. “I don’t know whether that was deliberate or whether it was wishful thinking or whether it’s people not understanding the full implications of what was being agreed.”Sir Jonathan, who resigned over the Prime Minister’s moves towards breaking international law “in a limited and specic way”, urged ministers not to make the same mistake again.“The idea that as soon as the going gets tough we threatened to tear up the agreement that we’ve only just recently reached or endorsed would be wrong in principle and a breach of international law,” he said.“It would seem to me to completely undermine any notion of trust and confidence in the UK as a trading partner, whether with the EU or with anybody . So I really hope that’s not what anybody means.”The News Letter put Sir Jonathan’s comments to the Northern Ireland Office and askedthe Secretary of State continues to insist that there is no Irish Sea border.In response, the NIO did not answer that question but said: “As we have always said, the Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed with the overriding objectives of protecting the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and recognising Northern Ireland’s status as an integral part of the UK.”Earlier this week Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove abandoned claims by Boris Johnson that dficulties with the border were “teething problems”, admitting that some issues were structural problems.:U-turn by Boris Johnson as he moves from denying Irish Sea border’s reality to attempting to delay some of its checksSam McBride: Read the small print – the Irish Sea border may be impossible to remove, evenMLAs vote it downBritish diggers and farm machinery now banned from Northern Ireland without soil-free ‘wash certicate’, due to Irish Sea borderGardeners snagged by farcical new Irish Sea border rule as British soil is banned from Northern Ireland because of Brexit – and harmful peat is promotedNI gardeners lose hundreds of seed ieties as major company Suttons withdraws fruit and veg seeds due to Irish Sea borderSam McBride: Shackled to Brexit, Arlene Foster can’t admit that it has been disastrous for Union – but Irish Sea border is radically reshaping NIIrish Sea border which Secretary of State Brandon Lewis claims doesn’t exist empties shelves and ends business in Northern Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

Heres how you can make it and what you need to serve it up!  Pancake mix - serves   egg  cup of self raising flour  potato peeled and grated   bunch of spring onions Salt and pepper  cup of milk  For the salad  bag of mixed leaf salad salad  cherry tomatoes    red onion sliced  packet of smoked salmon   Cream cheese mix  tablespoons of cream cheese  tablespoons of wholegrain mustard  To make the pancakes Transfer the grated potatoes to a dry tea towel and squeeze any excess water out. Transfer to a large bowl. Break in the egg and mix well, add the flour and mix again. Slowly add spring onion and gradually add milk . Heat a large non stick pan to the stove bring up to a medium heat. Drizzle in a little oil . Add approximately one tablespoon of the mix and cook for approximately three minutes each side until golden brown. Repeat For the poached egg bring a small saucepan with   pint of water to the boil, add one tablespoon of white vinegar or the juice of one lemon and a pinch of salt. Whisk it together - this will create a whirlpool effect. Add in your egg and take off the heat. To make the salad Place the mixed leaf in a large mixing bowl along with tomato and red onions and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle a little olive oil through the salad. For the cream cheese mix, quite simply mix together! Add a little salt pepper to taste of your liking. The presentation In a large bowl or plate place the pancake at the bottom of the dish. Arrange your salad . Neatly place on the smoked salmon and while this is being done the egg will be cooked. Lt it out with a slotted spoon and dab onto a sheet of kitchen paper - this drains off any access water. Place it on top of the salad, add the bit of baby spinach and some black pepper... and enjoy!
