The plan will help save the company $6 billion by 2020, according to GM\u0027Those are good architectures from a fuel economy perspective ... we\u0027ll continue to put those in the market, but we can take down our capital expenditures, while investing in electric and autonomous vehicles,\u0027 said Barra. \u0027You will see a greater share invested in autonomous and electric vehicles, both from a capital expenditure and\u0027 increased hiring for electric and self-driving engineering jobs.In a press statement, the company said it will close the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant in Detroit and Warren Transmission Operations in Warren.Other plants closing include the Oshawa Assembly Plant in Oshawa, Ontario, the Lordstown Assembly in Warren, Ohio, and the Baltimore Operations in White Marsh, Maryland.The company also plans to stop building several models now assembled at those plants, including the Chevrolet Cruze, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse.\u0027The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future,\u0027 said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra.\u0027We recognize the need to stay in front of changing market conditions and customer preferences to position our company for long-term success.\u0027          GM will lay off 14,700 factory and white-collar workers in North America and put five plants up for possible closure as it restructures to cut costs and focus more on autonomous and electric vehicles. One of those closures would be the Oshawa plant in Canada (pictured) The reduction includes 8,100 white-collar workers, some of whom will take buyouts and others who will be laid off. Most of the affected factories build cars that won\u0027t be sold in the US after next year. They could close or they could get different vehicles to build. They will be part of contract talks with the United Auto Workers union next year.About 6,000 factory workers could lose jobs in the US and Canada, although some could transfer to truck plants.The plan will help save the company $6billion by 2020, according to GM. The announcement is the biggest restructuring in North America for the US No. 1 carmaker since its bankruptcy a decade ago. The Monday closure of GM\u0027s plant in Oshawa, Ontario, was confirmed late Sunday by an official familiar with the decision.GM opened its factory in Oshawa, near Toronto, in 1953. The plant is used to make the Cadillac XTS and Chevrolet Impala sedans as well as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks.The company  has three other sites in the province of Ontario. It is unclear whether they will also be affected GM needs to reshape the company as it shifts its focus to lower emitting hybrid vehicles, technology that is not at the forefront at the Canadian plant.Too many GM factories are devoted to making slow-selling cars and the company can no longer afford to keep them all operating without making some tough decisions. But the political atmosphere might limit realistic choices for the Detroit automaker.           In a press statement, GM officials announced the closure of Lordstown Assembly (pictured) in Warren, Ohio          The company will also close the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant (pictured) in DetroitThe company said that the moves will help continue its focus on crossovers, SUVs and trucks. With the move, GM plans to cut 25 per cent of the executive staff and 15 per cent of the salaried and salaried contract staff.\u0027These actions will increase the long-term profit and cash generation potential of the company and improve resilience through the cycle,\u0027 Barra said in the statement.The closure of the Lordstown plant in Ohio didn\u0027t shock some analysts who predicted that location as one of GM\u0027s targets.  The car produced there is also is built in Mexico. The once-bustling factory already has lost two of its three shifts and 3,000 union jobs since the beginning of last year.Barra did not link the cuts announced Monday to tariff pressures, but said trade costs are among the \u0027headwinds\u0027 GM has to face as it deals with broader technology change and market shifts.With US car sales lagging, several car plants have fallen to just one shift, including its Hamtramck and Lordstown, assembly plant. Travel chaos on DC to NYC corridor after Delaware Memorial...Online sales hit a record £4bn on Cyber Monday - as...Share this articleA rule of thumb for the automotive industry is that if a plant is running below 80 per cent of production capacity, it is losing money. GM has several plants running well below that. Consultancy LMC estimates that Lordstown will operate at just 31 per cent of production capacity in 2018. Rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have both curtailed US car production. Ford said in April it planned to stop building nearly all cars in North America. The industrywide slowdown in passenger car sales started to pick up steam in 2017.The shift by US consumer preferences have been away from passenger cars to larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks has been swift and severe, leaving automakers scrambling to readjust.As recently as 2012, passenger cars made up more than 50 per cent of all US new vehicle sales. Through the first nine months of 2018, that had fallen to a little over 31 percent.While industry-wide passenger car sales were down 13.2 per cent through the first nine months of the year, pickup truck and SUV sales rose 8.3 per cent. As well as being roomier, the fuel economy on SUVs and crossovers has improved significantly.          Unifor, Canada\u0027s largest private sector union, said in a prepared statement that it does not have complete details of the announcement, but it has been informed that there is no product allocated to the Oshawa plant past December 2019Sales of Cruze, built at Lordstown, fell 27 per cent through September 2018. Impala, which is built at Oshawa and Hamtramck, was down 13 per cent. Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac CT6, which are built at Hamtramck, were down 14 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.Unifor, Canada\u0027s largest private sector union, said in a prepared statement that it has been informed that there is no product allocated to the Oshawa plant past December 2019.\u0027Based on commitments made during 2016 contract negotiations, Unifor does not accept this announcement and is immediately calling on GM to live up to the spirit of that agreement,\u0027 the union said in a statement on its website.Jennifer French, who represents Oshawa in the provincial legislature, said she finds the news \u0027gravely concerning\u0027.\u0027If GM Canada is indeed turning its back on 100 years of industry and community - abandoning workers and families in Oshawa - then this is a callous decision that must be fought,\u0027 she said in a statement.Rep Tim Ryan said in a statement on Monday that Trump \u0027promised us that his massive corporate tax cut would lead to dramatic reinvestments in our communities\u0027.\u0027That clearly is not happening,\u0027 Ryan said. \u0027What we\u0027ve gotten instead are broken promises and petty tweets. Corporations like General Motors and the President himself are the only ones benefiting from this economy—an economy rigged against workers who are playing by the rules but still not getting ahead.\u0027GM posted earnings of $2.5billion for the quarter ending September 30, despite the impact of trade tariffs and slipping sales. "},{"url":null,"title":"Traveller gang prime suspects raid Beckhams 6m Cotswolds mansion","story":"    The Beckhams at Paris Fashion Week on January  18 this yearA gang of travellers are believed to be behind raids on the Beckhams\u0027 home.The £6million mansion was targeted in two botched break-ins over the last two months.The group - whose names cannot be revealed - have been linked to murders, drug dealing and extortion over the past 30 years.  The family are based in the West Country and are known to carry out their crimes across southern England, Mirror Online reports.   David and Victoria Beckham were forced to up their security after the terrifying break-in at their family home.The couple, who have four children were left distraught over the attempted burglary - which ended when the intruders were chased away.Police were called to the couple’s £6 million home in Oxfordshire after their 24 hour security surveillance team noticed the men on the property’s CCTV.

The other is to get a leg up on a hold, that takes about half the weight off your arms.\u0027However, some were furious with the pilot and said he should be banned from flying.Zoran Allen said: \u0027Pilot should have crash landed IMMEDIATELY, end of story.

He had but one task: to check you were hooked in. \u0027The #1 killer of hang glider pilots is forgetting this.

I don\u0027t have anything further to add.\u0027But with the latest comments direct from Mrs May the contest is back on.          Mr Corbyn (pictured yesterday) said he would \u0027relish\u0027 the prospect of a debate after being questioned about reports Mrs May had asked for one on SundayHardline Brexiteers last night said they should be represented, and opposition parties also said they should feature.The SNP, the Lib Dems, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru\u0027s insisted they should be involved in any TV clash.Tory Eurosceptics have also complained about being closed out of the clash. Sir Bernard Jenkin said: \u0027Very important point for the BBC here. Corbyn was for Remain, Theresa May was for Remain, the 52 per cent who voted Leave have got to be represented in any debates.\u0027It cannot be polarised between a Remain Labour Party and a Remain Prime Minister who has negotiated a Remain Brexit.          Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (seen on November 22) has said she also wants to join in with the debate \u0027The 52 need to be represented or else it\u0027s not balanced broadcasting.\u0027Mr Corbyn welcomed the idea. A spokesman for the Labour leader said: \u0027Jeremy would relish a head-to-head debate with Theresa May about her botched Brexit deal and the future of our country.\u0027It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds.

Ms Gribble lived on the farm and was a regular rider, prosecutor Alison May said.\u0027She knows this piece of land and has ridden and walked it before,\u0027 she said. \u0027She is aware there is a wire which has been there for a number of years. You duck under it.\u0027But Ms Gribble was not aware of a second wire being placed across the bridleway. Ms May said she was riding on July 13 when, passing under the first wire, she put her horse into a canter.In her personal impact statement, Ms Gribble said: \u0027I believed the rest of the path was clear.          Ms Gribble (pictured) was a regular rider at the farm who knew the route well - but broke her back when the farm owner failed to place warning signs leading up to the new wire \u0027A few steps into the canter I found myself being ripped backwards off the horse having being hit by something.\u0027Ms May said the wire struck Ms Gribble in the throat and then pulled up across her face, cutting her lip and nose.She fell off the back of her horse, landing on her back, while her mount carried on down the bridleway.The horse, which was distressed, was stopped after a short distance by other people, who called for an ambulance to treat Ms Gribble. After six hours in hospital, Ms Gribble was sent home in considerable pain.          Ms Gribble is pictured after her accident at the farm in Cornwall It later emerged she had broken two bones in her back. Ms May said that for a time she could not drive and was off work.Ms May said police and an officer from Cornwall Council attended, who attempted to remove the wire but received an electric shock. Both wires were later removed.Representing himself at court, Care said: \u0027Two days before the incident, we had a phone call to say there were about 24 cattle in the hedge looking to get out. It\u0027s a very busy road at Four Lanes and if cattle get out into the road it could be very serious.\u0027We decided on a quick fix without thinking it through. We decided to do what my father had done 20 years ago, which was to put a wire over the hedge. Unfortunately, that\u0027s the accident which happened which is, I suppose, our fault.\u0027We had no intention whatsoever to cause anybody harm and we\u0027ve never done anything like this before. We are extremely sorry.\u0027Care was fined £512 and ordered to pay £500 compensation to Ms Gribble, £85 court costs and £51 victim surcharge.Presiding magistrate John Aldred told him: \u0027We recognise the fact that you are a man of previous good character.Rider and horse die after road smash between BMW and cart on...Family whose prized horse was killed when it fell through...Share this article\u0027We also believe your early guilty plea reflects your remorse.

The bruises on her body were excessive.\u0027I think it\u0027s fair to say she\u0027s lucky the injuries she had were not more severe.\u0027          The rider was later found to have broken bones in her back following the accident caused by a new wire placed across a riding route at the farm Speaking after the hearing, Ms Gribble said the wire was only 2.1 metres high. She also said Care was not apologetic immediately after the incident and complained about horse riders being on his land.She said: \u0027I was in absolute agony. I was in a great deal of pain and I was stunned and confused.\u0027I could have been paralysed, which is a fate worse than death. I was lucky in a way. At the end of the day, as a horse rider, I have every right to ride down that bridleway.\u0027I am still recovering from my injuries both mentally and physically, and although I have ridden horses for 30 years, I now don\u0027t feel like riding, as my confidence has been completely knocked.\u0027I am a horse rider and a walker and there are so many routes nowadays being blocked off by farmers.\u0027It\u0027s getting harder and harder to ride horses on roads because it\u0027s getting more dangerous. I want landowners to know they can\u0027t do this or there will be consequences.\u0027Cornwall Council have known about this issue but, despite promising to do something, have done nothing for years.

Leaker: Assange\u0027s WikiLeaks released thousands of emails which had been obtained by Russian secret service operatives by hacking the Democrat Party          Complications: Manafort\u0027s final visit reportedly took place \u0027around March 2016\u0027, the same month he was hired by President Donald TrumpMeanwhile, special counsel Robert Mueller is accusing Manafort of violating his plea agreement by repeatedly lying to federal investigators, an extraordinary allegation that could expose him to a lengthier prison sentence - and potentially more criminal charges.The torpedoing of Manafort\u0027s plea deal, disclosed in a court filing Monday, also results in special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s team losing a cooperating witness from the top of Trump\u0027s presidential campaign who was present for several key episodes under investigation.That includes a Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer he was told had derogatory information on Democrat Hillary Clinton.The move signals a return to the acrimonious relationship Manafort has had with the special counsel\u0027s office since his indictment last year. Before his plea agreement, Manafort aggressively challenged the special counsel\u0027s legitimacy in court, went through a bitter trial and landed himself in jail after prosecutors discovered he had attempted to tamper with witnesses in his case.In the latest filing, Mueller\u0027s team said Manafort \u0027committed federal crimes\u0027 by lying about \u0027a variety of subject matters\u0027 even after he agreed to truthfully cooperate with the investigation. Prosecutors said they will detail the \u0027nature of the defendant\u0027s crimes and lies\u0027 in writing at a later date to the judge.Through his attorneys, Manafort denied lying, saying he \u0027believes he provided truthful information\u0027 during a series of sessions with Mueller\u0027s investigators. He also disagreed that he breached his plea agreement. Still, both sides now agree they can\u0027t resolve the conflict, and U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson should set a date to sentence him.Manafort, who remains jailed, had been meeting with the special counsel\u0027s office since he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He cut that deal to head off a second trial after being convicted last summer of eight felony counts related to millions of dollars he hid from the IRS in offshore accounts.Both cases stemmed from his Ukrainian political work and undisclosed lobbying work he admitted to carrying out in the U.S. in violation of federal law.          Special counsel Robert Mueller is accusing Manafort, pictured, of violating his plea agreement by repeatedly lying to federal investigatorsAs part of his plea agreement, Manafort pledged to \u0027cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly\u0027 with the government \u0027in any and all matters\u0027 prosecutors deemed necessary. That included his work on the Trump campaign as well as his Ukrainian political work, which remains under investigation by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.Prosecutors there are looking into the conduct of longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig and former Republican congressman and lobbyist Vin Weber to determine whether they violated federal law by failing to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department. None of the men has been charged with any crimes.As part of his plea deal, Manafort also forfeited many of his rights as well as his ability to withdraw the plea if he broke any of the terms. In return, prosecutors agreed to not bring additional charges against him and to ask a judge for a reduction of his sentence if he provided \u0027substantial assistance.\u0027But with prosecutors saying he breached the agreement, Manafort now faces serious repercussions such as the possibility of prosecution on additional charges including the 10 felony counts prosecutors dropped when he made the deal.Manafort already faces up to five years in prison on the two charges in his plea agreement. In his separate Virginia case, Manafort\u0027s potential sentencing under federal guidelines has not yet been calculated, but prosecutors have previously said he could face as much as 10 years in prison on those charges.He is scheduled to be sentenced in that case in February. His co-defendant, Rick Gates, who spent a longer time on the campaign and worked on the Trump inaugural committee, has not had a sentencing date set yet.

You can see how its curators might be sick of seeing paintings by great artists such as Titian and Piero della Francesca wall-to-wall, day in, day out. So they’re treating themselves to the lowbrow fun of exhibiting a bit of nonsense by a painter who has been slighted for a century and on this evidence deserves to be slighted for several more.Or so I am trying to rationalise the gallery’s mystifying attempt to redefine Edwin Landseer’s ludicrous The Monarch of the Glen as a great painting. It’s hard to understand how anyone can see this as anything but the lousy, lifeless relic that it is. Landseer’s mid-19th century painting of a stag posing majestically against a backdrop of Scottish mountains is trite in feeling and mechanical in execution. Far from a sublime romantic vision, it looks like an advert – and that is what it has often been used as. The accompanying book – does this little grouse-dropping of a show merit one? – reproduces a 1927 whisky ad among other uses of this painted answer to tartan golf trousers.Landseer was the most renowned animal artist in Victorian Britain. He was also the best connected: there is a sketch here by Queen Victoria, who made a copy of his charcoal wall drawings in Ardverikie shooting lodge before they were destroyed in a fire. Yet for all his fame, this exhibition reveals that Landseer had a secret. He could not portray animals at all. Oh, he could get their glossy fur right, give them appropriate poses – like the Monarch of the Glen’s proud hilltop stance – and set them in rugged landscapes. He just could not make them come to life. His beasts have as much vitality as a hunter’s trophy head in some antediluvian gentlemen’s club.The exhibition makes this painfully visible by including a drawing by a much greater animal artist, George Stubbs, who in the 18th century dissected horses to learn the secrets of equine anatomy. Landseer, setting out to be Stubbs’s artistic heir, purchased his dissection drawings, and one is exhibited here. It pulled me toward it like a magnet. It has the presence of a Rembrandt portrait. Its electric energy cruelly illuminates the emptiness of Landseer’s dull fumblings. The fussy, pedantic precision of Landseer’s archetypally Victorian brushwork ensures that all hints of true wildness are smothered in aspic. Honestly, after a while the room starts to turn brown, as if you were locked in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s brain.Tragically, it may be the very hollowness and kitsch of Landseer that appeals to the National Gallery. As I say, they have got sick of true masterpieces like Stubbs’s Whistlejacket. Bad art and phoney images are the stuff of contemporary irony, after all. And they have paired Landseer with Rachel Maclean’s 2012 film The Lion and the Unicorn, which takes gleeful pleasure in the hokey national images of England and Scotland. Tartan and the Union Jack are spattered everywhere in Maclean’s brightly coloured romp. She plays all the characters, her face painted as a kid’s party lion or whitened as a marionette-like Queen – while the real Queen speaks in a sampled recording from an early Christmas broadcast. In another scene, the Lion and the Unicorn hilariously mouth the voices of Jeremy Paxman and Alex Salmond.She could probably create a great TV show – Spitting Image meets the American surrealist Matthew Barney – but I’m not sure why her work needs to be in the National Gallery. Its weaknesses are exposed nearly as harshly as Landseer’s. Contemporary art should come into this space only for a good reason, and with its eyes firmly fixed on the challenge of being among all these greats.

Roald would, I know, be thrilled.”In a press release announcing the partnership, Netflix said it intends to be faithful to “the quintessential spirit and tone of Dahl”, but also announced that it would be “building out an imaginative story universe that expands far beyond the pages of the books themselves”.“Immersing ourselves in the extraordinary worlds of Roald Dahl stories has been an honour and a massive amount of fun, and we are grateful for the trust the Roald Dahl Story Company and the Dahl family have placed in our team to deliver more moments of shared joy to families around the world,” said Melissa Cobb, Netflix’s vice president of kids and family content. “We have great creative ambition to reimagine the journeys of so many treasured Dahl characters in fresh, contemporary ways with the highest quality animation and production values.”The shows will be produced in conjunction with the Roald Dahl Story Company, which oversees his legacy in adaptations across film, television and stage.Netflix’s move into animation comes after years of licensing films and series from Disney, which has plans to launch its own streaming service in 2019. The move will see Disney remove its content from third party services, in the hopes fans will follow.Netflix is now investing hundreds of millions of dollars into animation and has unveiled several films and series, including a stop-motion adaptation of Pinocchio to be directed by Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, an original animated series by Book of Life director Jorge Gutierrez called Maya and the Three, and an adaptation of the Lois Lowry children’s book The Willoughbys, headed up by Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 director Kris Pearn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4299cbb4f3a28213cbb84040bf6c516d5e4be60/0_373_3451_2070/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48d2b86262d2131dda15df8bdd101e3a","title":"the art of biography with diarmaid macculloch and ken krimstein books podcast","story":"This week, we are looking at two very different ways to write a life.

Along with flying cars, rocket-fuelled monorails and supersonic passenger aircraft, it is one of the great “what ifs?” technologies. It was supposed to transform our cities, but never quite caught on – outside Asia at least.In the past few years, though, a new generation of engineers have been quietly developing cheaper and more efficient maglev systems, some reaching eye-watering speeds of 500kmh (370 miles per hour) and above. And with the “hyperloop” projects promoted by Elon Musk essentially maglev trains in a vacuum, the technology’s supporters believe it might just get another chance.The world’s first commercial maglev opened in 1984 in Birmingham. Developed by British Rail, this floating capsule out to the airport was technologically miles ahead of anything in the world at the time.A generation of travellers enjoyed the smooth, futuristic ride over the top of sprawling car parks, a police station and a dual carriageway until high maintenance costs saw it shut down 11 years later. The revolutionary carriages ended up dumped in a hedge a few miles from the runway before eventually being sold on eBay.Germany embraced maglev technology too. A company called Transrapid was commissioned to build a maglev system from Munich to its airport, replacing the glacially slow S-Bahn, but the project was iced when estimated costs almost doubled to €3bn.Berlin briefly had a slow-speed maglev, and cities as varied as Timișoara, Vancouver and Moscow developed their own vehicles and tested them – but none of these entered full service. Moscow’s TA-05 in particular was a curvaceous classic with a kitsch design that was even featured in a Soviet sci-fi film.Slow-speed maglevs also ran in Hamburg and Kassel in Germany – often as short-lived exhibition gimmicks.Europe’s high-speed maglev dream ended in 2006 after 23 people were killed when a maglev train on Transrapid’s test track in Emsland, Germany, hit a maintenance vehicle. A few years earlier Transrapid had developed the fastest passenger train in service in the world – the Shanghai maglev, which still runs to Pudong airport at speeds of 431kmh – but it never won another contract after the Emsland crash. The test track stands idle.Europe now prefers high-speed trains with wheels. France has laid more than 2,600km of high-speed track and Spain more than 3,200km, with the fastest European trains running at over 320kmh.Britain briefly mulled over the Ultraspeed proposal for a 500kmh £30bn London to Scotland maglev in 2005, but instead opted for the high-speed HS2 rail line. HS2 is now estimated to cost £56bn to build and will see trains running at up to 360kmh.Across the Atlantic, a maglev from Pittsburgh airport to Greensburg was considered in the mid-1990s, and a proposed Pittsburgh-to-Philadelphia maglev was cancelled in 2011. Orlando almost had a maglev moment in 2012, but balked. San Diego had a test track and considered building a longer one to connect to a new city airport in 2005. All these ventures were abandoned on cost grounds.It is the cities of Asia that have embraced maglev in the 21st century. Shanghai’s high-speed maglev is the fastest commercial high-speed electric train in the world, while in Japan, the under-construction Tokyo-to-Osaka maglev will trump everyone with speeds of 500kmph when it opens in 2037, cutting the journey time from four hours by bullet train to 40 minutes.Lower-speed maglevs include the new Beijing line, an 8km route in Qingyuan scheduled to open in September and others in Changsha and Seoul.Dozens of Chinese cities – including Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Guangzhou – are considering new maglevs. Systems have been proposed recently in Bangalore, Hong Kong and Taipei.There is also one US project left on the drawing board – a maglev to run the short distance between Baltimore and Washington DC, cities that could almost be twins were it not for the nightmare traffic between them at rush hour. If a maglev is built anywhere in the US, it will be there.Meanwhile, as Silicon Valley showoffs blow big budgets on madcap marketing campaigns and comical launches, scientists working on maglev continue to plug away quietly.Sergey Smirnov organised this year’s biennial conference for maglev engineers, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts in St Petersburg. Instead of TED talk-style pomp and free coconut lattes, the event was opened with a choir and closed with a boat ride down the Neva as a white-suited band played jazz standards. It all seemed strangely anachronistic for such a futuristic technology.“For decades maglev couldn’t offer a better product in terms of price and efficiency than high-speed rail,” says Smirnov, an engineer himself. “Now, thanks to the work of many scientists and engineers, maglev offers speeds much higher than trains with wheels and has the lowest operation costs of any transport.”The technology is also incredibly energy-efficient and has a very low impact on the environment.After 30 years promoting maglev systems in the US, the former Transrapid engineer Larry Blow is optimistic for their future. “As more and more people experience the differences in speed, noise, ride comfort and safety that are features of maglev, I feel confident it will become more popular around the world,” he says.Maybe the magnetic attractions of maglev will sway more cities in the coming years.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4834b92f4590468e32cd876fb11a6c24e7185df4/0_221_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9156cf89eed40de89181384c80b8ee4","title":"bbc headteacher resigned tv james pope school","story":"Now viewers can see for themselves what cuts are doing, says James Pope from BBC2’s School seriesJames Pope has not been watching School, the BBC2 documentary he stars in. “I was hugely nervous. You don’t know how people will view you. Despite four years of generally very positive feedback from my line managers, governors, the trust and community, I thought there was a risk people would watch it and go: what an idiot.”The series follows the pupils, teachers, parents and leaders of different secondary schools in a multi-academy trust across the 2017-2018 academic year. It shows Pope struggling to improve standards at Marlwood, a rural comprehensive in Gloucestershire that has been put into special measures by Ofsted, while simultaneously being expected to cut nearly £1m from his annual budget. Teaching, leadership and support staff numbers are decimated, class sizes are increased, morale falls pupils and teachers struggle to shake off the label “inadequate”. Last week, in episode three, after a poor Ofsted report, Pope is seen handing in his resignation. He says the resultant outpouring of empathy from headteachers has been remarkable.“I started my headship with a vision of what I wanted to achieve and I came to realise that increasingly, I was making compromises,” he says. “And the more you have to compromise, the more you sit there thinking: this isn’t what I wanted to do. This isn’t what I thought my headship would be about.”Initially, the cuts reflected a shrinking population in Marlwood’s rural catchment area. But Pope, who has 21 years’ experience as a teacher, says the financial pressure was compounded by the “unfair” cuts being levied  on all schools by the government. “On top of the savings we were having to make uniquely at Marlwood, you pile the cuts in real terms that all schools are having to deal with …” He shakes his head. “It’s not right.”Poor Ofsted reports made the situation worse, putting parents and teachers off the school despite improvements in exam results under Pope, leading to even fewer pupils, stressed staff and further cuts. “I had to explain to parents: you don’t get anything special if you’re put in special measures. There is no more money. You don’t get any additional support or resources. In my experience, all you get is additional scrutiny and additional pressure.”He began working 14-hour days, getting up at 5am and returning home at 9pm, only to carry on working. A father of four children aged three to 13, he found it difficult to switch off. “It ended up becoming all consuming. I’d be doing something nice with my family and in the back of my mind I’d be thinking: well, if I did this or that, I might just save another £50,000.”He describes making cuts while at the same time trying to impress Ofsted as like “stepping into the ring with Mike Tyson, and somebody’s tied one arm behind your back”. Inspectors did not seem to take into account the financial and cultural challenges the school was going through. “I needed more understanding of our context and of the difficulties we faced, and more time to actually make the changes that were necessary.”What stressed him out the most was knowing the impact the cuts were having on his pupils. “It’s not so much the financial pressure that got to me. It’s that it stopped me doing the educational stuff I wanted to do. You have these conversations: Can we do that? No, we can’t afford it. Can we put that in place? No, we can’t afford it. So you just end up compromising all of the time to try and get the best out of what you have got.”The lack of support his academy trust received from the Department for Education appalled him. “Like lots of schools up and down the country, we’d written to the DfE about funding and campaigned collectively as a trust. But it’s easy for that to be swatted away with a line about how education funding has not been cut.”That is why he let the cameras in: to give his community an insight into the problems the school was dealing with, while making it harder for the DfE to explain away what viewers saw with their own eyes. “There is now very real evidence of the challenges we were facing. And judging from the number of people who have been in touch to say ‘that’s what my school is like’, what’s been happening at Marlwood is not unique.”He has started a blog about his experiences. “I want to use what is a fairly unique opportunity for me, thanks to the TV series, to ask some questions about what special measures means,” he says.After leaving Marlwood, Pope set up a consultancy, Inspire Educate, and hopes to use his experiences to help other school leaders.Today he looks years younger than on TV, and seems a lot happier. What made him finally decide to go? “Ultimately, there was one compromise too many. I felt as if I was in a position at many points last year where I just could not win, because of a financial situation nobody appeared able to help us to solve. And then I reached a point where I thought: you know what? I am fed up with compromising. These children are the future of this country. Are we prepared, as a society, to invest in our young people – or not?”School is a six-part series at 9pm on Tuesdays on BBC2•This article was amended on 27 November 2018. A previous version said Marlwood was a secondary modern school. This was incorrect.

Now they fight for unpaid work placements“I always planned to go to university to do photography,” says Ryan Saradjola, a London-based photographer. Despite considering himself not to be very academic, he persevered through college, building a portfolio that landed him a place at the prestigious London College of Fashion (LCF). But after a year at LCF, Saradjola opted out of higher education entirely. Offered the opportunity to work alongside the famous fashion photographer Rankin, he took the leap. “It was an amazing experience,” he says. “I learned so much from that year and a half. Working with his clients, seeing how he worked – the whole process was eye-opening.”Saradjola’s hands-on approach led him to further internships, studio work and assisting opportunities. But while industry experience was the foundation of Saradjola’s career, he concedes that it’s not the right route for everyone. “I always wanted to do more hands-on work and get involved straight away, but other people need more time in the studio,” he says.“The issue we have is that there are so many courses – so many graduates – that it’s really hard for employers to identify the ones that are really good and proactive,” says Lesley Peacock, a senior fashion lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University. “If a company advertises an internship, they are awash with applications.”Some companies are wise to the necessity of internships to bulk up graduates’ CVs. Some take advantage of the abundance of free labour at their disposal, occupying a grey area where employment laws are concerned. As one fashion marketing student currently undertaking a “sandwich year” at a luxury fashion brand says: “I was just rearranging store cupboards, scanning in returns, doing really menial work. And if I ever took a day off, all hell would break loose. They were understaffed so they were using us interns to get the stuff done that nobody else wanted to do.” With only basic expenses covered sporadically, the student was advised to leave the company after explaining they simply couldn’t afford to pay rent in London anymore.Graduate Helena’s experience in fashion publishing was similar. “There were three other girls interning at the magazine,” she says. “They would get a fresh batch of interns every four weeks. We would be in a tiny little fashion cupboard surrounded by endless samples and returns. It was a lot of work and it made me realise that the magazine couldn’t survive without interns.”More than ever, students fear for their job prospects and are willing to stretch themselves to gain the contacts they need to progress within the industry. Much like fashion itself, the landscape is varied. Some students return with stories of mistreatment and exploitation. Others recall diligent mentors and invaluable insider experience. But a lack of pay is the common thread, and that fosters an environment which welcomes those with the financial means to work for free and spurns those without.Could saving on tuition fees and going straight into industry be the solution? While some might be able to secure an internship without a degree – subject to hard work and financial sacrifice – many more would struggle. As Peacock says: “For the 15 years that I’ve worked across textiles, fashion communication and fashion design, all of the graduates that have done really well undertook placements and internships.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d008f04e3013faf0c4ea1334d38b102764091b7/0_126_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629924bb8c0e36b0e88d4e9877baf556","title":"tell us was 2018 the year you woke up to climate change","story":"We’d like to know if you changed your opinion on climate change and whether there was a moment that convinced you of its impactThis year has seen more than 200 natural disaster events take place across the world.

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way.

Cue Amy Powney’s 22-piece eveningwear capsule collection for Mother of Pearl.London-based Powney is a rising star on the fashion scene and is known for her frank approach when it comes to sustainability, admitting that “fundamentally we all need to stop shopping”. She is also, however, respected for her realism and is one of a growing fleet of designers who promote the philosophy to “buy less and buy better”.As the creative director at MOP, she has made it her mission to equip herself with the research and knowledge that allows the brand to deliver sustainable and ethical collections that still have star appeal (Gwyneth Paltrow, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Laura Jackson are fans). To create her new eveningwear collection, she started to develop her own fabrics to dispel the notion of “hempy, hippy” clothes and “offer a more elevated product to show what can be done under a sustainable umbrella”.Her design ethos has always revolved around a day-to-night identity, which delivers fashion that can easily adapt to myriad occasions. It is a mood she has extended to the capsule collection, which comprises high-neck, asymmetric and bateau-neck dresses in black, beige, red and floral prints, strap tops, tailored trousers, coats and blazers. Featuring the brand’s signature dropped-shoulder and pearl-embellished ruching, Powney says the idea is to feel comfortable as well as special, reflecting the sentiment that “women have got to a point where they dress for themselves rather than onlookers”. To hit her message home, however, another shift in perception needs to happen in tandem.It’s the second step in MOP’s No Frills campaign, which saw Powney and her team spend the past three years drilling down on the brand’s supply chain so that they could start to understand what can be a very opaque and complex process.“I decided that we were going to work it out for ourselves, so we went and met with farmers and spinners and weavers to try to piece the supply chain together so we could see how it works, what the environmental and ethical impacts are along the way, what can we do to improve it and what fabric companies are legit and sustainable and who are not,” she says. As such, all her pieces, including the new capsule (with prices ranging from £350 to £995), are made from Italian fabrics in Portugal, and Powney has eyes on everything. Off the back of her findings, she is in the process of visiting publications and fashion houses to give them bitesize lessons on how to judge if a brand really is sustainable or is missing the point entirely.“Lots of people don’t understand what sustainability really means … it’s not just the factory where something is made … the biggest environmental impact happens before that, when it’s being grown or synthetically produced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf42bb52aee6c0951dc7bfb68bed4085a039906/0_343_7090_4254/master/7090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f4a577eb0ded19a7fee3c1b527f83d7","title":"from lichen to kelp jerky how did food become so pretentious","story":"Guava vinaigrette and calamansi juice are coming to a restaurant near you soon, according to a new report. Give me spaghetti bolognese with Dolmio sauce, any dayIf there was ever proof that sometimes progress just means going backwards, here it is: a list of the predicted food trends for 2019 has been released by a marketing consultant, and it includes lichen, calamansi juice and dulse (seaweed)It is as if Homo erectus never evolved. Man is still fish, stuck in the sea, munching on sea-greens and foraging for lichen. Lichen! The fungus that grows over rocks and looks a bit like athlete’s foot is coming to a restaurant near you, sprinkled on toast and probably costing a tenner.In a separate forecast, by the upmarket chain Whole Foods, other favourites next year will include “Pacific Rim flavours” such as guava vinaigrette, and pineapple and passion fruit sparkling water. And kelp jerky is due a moment.This should come as no surprise: researchers have already documented how restaurants fill menus with fancy ingredients most people have never heard of because it means they can bump up prices. Nothing says “that is worth tons of money” more than having to watch a video of how to pronounce something before ordering it.Food speaks to us in many ways. In Grayson Perry’s Channel 4 documentary on class, All in the Best Possible Taste, he revealed how ostentatious and often inane displays of taste often expose a desperate desire for status. In the same way that a potbelly was once a sign of a person wealthy enough to eat to excess, we now covet exotic fruits because they make us look well-travelled.My favourite meal is spaghetti bolognese, mainly because it is stodgy and comforting. Everyone thinks their mother’s version is the best and my mum always made ours with Dolmio sauce – and no matter how much my middle-class friends look down on that, I will always find it the most delicious thing. It reminds me of a time when I didn’t have to pretend to believe that everything had to be made from scratch to taste good.Our meals need not be specially engineered to meet our current ideas of “wellness”. My hangover meal is packet noodles and hot sauce – not courgetti noodles, and not kelp noodles. Sainsbury’s Basics noodles provide all the salt, sugar and carbs that I need when I want to be brought back to life.These foods are popular for good reason. They are accessible and you know what they taste like. Unpretentious food is great because it is just fine as it is, and it doesn’t need bragging about. If the simple food in life could speak, it would be saying: “Take me as I am!” Lichen, on the other hand, would be begging you not to notice who it once was: a mouldy sea-green, hiding under the surface, trying not to be seen.

They’ve had chances of their own, but none as glorious as the three sitters missed between them by Maxwell Cornet and Memphis Depay. West Ham missed several good chances against them at the weekend too their goal is leading a bit of a charmed life. 29 min: Chance for Lyon! Mendy scorches down the left wing, leaving Kyle Walker in his dust. He squares the ball for Maxwell Cornet, five or six yards out. With the goal at his mercy, he takes a heavy first touch, then slips while trying to poke the ball home. Laporte es in and Cornet’s effort loops over the ball, possibly taking a deflection on its way. That’s another real let-off for City. 27 min: Sane picks out David Silva in the Lyon penalty area, but the midfielder is dispossessed by a combination of Ferland Mendy and Tanguy Ndombele.26 min: Marcelo tries to pick out Depay with a long ball to the corner, but John Stones reaches it first and calmly averts what passed for the danger. 23 min: Oops. Mr Fernandinho gets booked for a foul, his second in quick succession, on Memphis Depay that looked something and nothing. He couldn’t get out of the player’s way and Depay ran into him before collapsing dramatically to the turf holding his neck and head.Free-kick for Lyon, about 30 yards out, straight in front of the Lyon goal. Depay tries his luck, but his fairly decent effort whistles a little too high and wide.21 min: Another sustained period of City possession comes to an end when Leroy Sane loses the ball out on the left flank. Fernandinho’s been immense for the visitors thus far, controlling the tempo in midfield and pinging passes around for fun. Elsewhere in Group F: It’s already Hoffenheim 1-2 Shakhtar Donetsk in Germany. As things stand, Manchester City’s route into the knockout stages is assured. 17 min: Back to Memphis Depay’s golden opportunity to put Lyon ahead. Maxwell Cornet sent in a cross that sat up perfectly for the cigar-smoking freestyle rapper at the far post. In front of Kyle Walker a couple of yards out and with no shortage of goal to aim at e seemed to take his eye off the ball, vaguely brushed it with his studs and made a complete pig’s ear of his volley. Oh Memphis.15 min: Having been teed up by Sterling just moments ago, Mahrez is now set up by Leroy Sane at the end of another counter-attack. He doesn’t get much power behind his shot from 12 yards or so and it’s deflected out for a corner by Denayer. Nothing comes from the set-piece, which is cleared by Rafael on sentry duty at the near post. 14 min: Chances at both ends as Memphis Depay misses an easy volley seconds before City break up the pitch and Riyad Mahrez shoots low and too close to Lopez with the goal at his mercy. Depay’s miss was definitely the worst of the two, but they were two gilt-edged chances. 12 min: Mahrez tries to play Aguero in behind with a neat pass after picking the ball up from Ferndinho. He overcooks his delivery, which runs straight through to Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopez.11 min: Free-kick for City, wide on the right in line with the edge of the Lyon penalty area after a foul on Kyle Walker by Marcal. Silva takes the free-kick, but Fekir blocks and clears.10 min: City enjoy a period of sustained possession but are unable to get too far out of their own half. Mahrez picks up the ball on the right touchline and plays a short pass to Sergio Aguero, who is dispossessed by City old boy Jason Denayer. He plays it forward to Nabil Fekir, who loses it again. 8 min: City’s players are being pressed relentlessly by their opponents whenever they get on the ball, but are coping quite admirably despite being forced to work the ball backwards repeatedly. 6 min: Free-kick for Lyon wide on the right, a good way out after a Fernandinho foul. Nabil Fekir fancies his chances from distance - it’s at least 35 yards - but his left-footed effort is blocked by Riyad Mahrez in the two-man City wall.4 min: The corner comes in from Memphis Depay and Maxwell Cornet tries to get his head to the ball, but doesn’t make contact. If he’d got any sort of contact on the ball there, Lyon would be a goal up. They’ve started well.3 min: A scrappy enough start with both sides taking turns to get on the ball and try to feel their way into the game. Atmeric Laporte concedes the first corner of the game, cutting out a cross from the left that was intended for Memphis Depay. 1 min: Lyon kick off playing in white shirts with red and blue panels across the shoulders, white shorts and white socks. MAnchester City’s players are dressed in ... ummm, sort of purple-ish shirts with orange sashes, orange shorts and orange socks with purple turn-downs. Crikey.Not long now ... The teams are in the tunnel and march out led by referee Gianluca Rocchi, who is wearing a shirt so thin and transparent you can clearly see his red card through the material of his pocket in his pocket. Cue: the Champions League anthem and kick-off is just moments away in a packed stadium.A brief musical interlude: Of course, more recently, Memphis made headlines for ... whatever this is. Memphis Depay has been scoring up a storm a storm for Lyon this season, but in a recent article posted on the  Sport Network, Adam White and Eric Devin questioned the Dutch footballer’s attitude. By their account, Depay is unpopular in the dressing-room, hugely arrogant and has made no secret of his desire to move to a club more befitting a man of his incredible talents. Sadly, the former Manchester United players reputation seems to go before him and offers from bigger clubs appear to be few and far between. He has, however, been linked with a return to Old Trafford.There’s good news for Lyon as Nabil Fekir is passed fit to start. According to Uefa’s graphic, which may not be entirely accurate, the hosts are going to play with three at the back and two wing-backs, which would be something of a radical departure from the 4-4-1-1 they employed so successfully against Man City at the Etihad. Moussa Dembele is out and doesn’t even make the Lyon bench.Phil Foden doesn’t start for City, with Fernandinho, Riyad Mahrez and David Silva occupying the midfield berths. John Stones returns for Nicolas Otamendi, Oleksandr Zinchenko replaces Fabian Delph and Riyad Mahrez is in for Ilkay Gundogan. “Manchester City are one of the favourites to win the Champions League,” said the Lyon manager. “They’re one of the best sides in Europe, but we have our ambitions, too. That’s the only way to trouble them again – we need to believe in ourselves.”Appearing before the press yesterday, the Manchester city manager addressed about his mini-injury crisis. “I prefer to have all the squad to choose from but it is what it is,” he said. “We have to adapt with the guys that are here and we will try to do a good job. The others who aren’t here will do their best to recover.”Unusually, he also addressed Manchester City’s critics, specifically those who think the club is only successful because of it’s vast wealth. “For the people who don’t love us too much, who use money as an argument, then we have failed if we don’t win the Champions League,” he said. “But the fans love watching the team. Of course, we want to qualify and arrive in the best condition possible. If we are lucky to go forward in the competition then that speaks for itself.“Tomorrow is a big chance to be in Europe in February. We lost one game and bounced back we reacted so well but the job is not over. We have to win one more and hopefully, we can close the group stage.”Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan are both suffering from muscle injuries and join their fellow midfielder Kevin De Bruyne on the sidelines. Gabriel Jesus is suffering from a foot problem and also unavailable for selection, which means Pep Guardiola could give Phil Foden his second Champions League start. The 18-year-old played 89 minutes of the second leg of last season’s round of 16 second leg defeat at the hands of Basel, with City ultimately going through 5-2 on aggregate.Lyon, meanwhile, have been sweating on the fitness of their star player Nabil Fekir. The 25-year-old midfielder had been struggling, but has trained for the past two days and looks certain to play some part tonight. Also among Lyon’s lame and halt, right-back Léo Dubois and striker Amine Gouiri will not.Manchester City travel to Lyon tonight knowing a draw will guarantee their progress to the knockout stages, while victory will secure them top spot in Group G with one game to spare. Pep Guardiola’s side are unbeaten since their surprise defeat to the French side in September, having won 12 of their 13 matches since. Second in the French top flight but already 15 points behind Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon also sit second here in Group G. Should they lose and Hoffenheim beat Shaktar Donetsk, that’ll change – the French side will be overtaken ahead of the final round of games. However, Lyon could also secure their passage to the knockout stages with a draw, if the match in Germany also finishes all square. Kick-off is at 8pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965026f3de593f34a08cb2664480b5e99b62e20c/171_183_2243_1345/master/2243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccb04b83920edd057f2dcee4c00abd47","title":"manchester united v young boys champions league live","story":"34 min: Young Boys haven’t been very good. United should be doing so much more.33 min: Martial tries to bustle past Camara, who stands his ground to fend off the United forward. 30 min: Camara erts Shaw’s cross straight to Martial and makes up for his error by blocking the forward’s shot. He goes down and United continue to attack. Lingard has a pop from 20 yards and appeals for handball against Von Bergen, who certainly stuck out his elbow to deflect the ball wide on the edge of the area. Nothing doing, though, only a corner. Nothing comes from it.26 min: Smalling fizzes a pass into Lingard, who cleverly flicks the ball to Rashford, throwing Young Boys into disarray at the back. Rashford decides to shoot from 25 yards and Von Ballmoos, who looks beaten, is relieved to see the striker’s low shot bounce just wide of the right post.25 min: Lingard darts down the right and tries to find Rashford in the middle. His cross is extremely poor.24 min: It remains 0-0 in Turin, where Juventus are playing Valencia. It’s weird to think United could still win this group.22 min: Shaw finds space on the left and whips in a cross that finds Lingard. He tries to touch it back to Matic, but Aebischer’s there first. He wins the ball and Matic steps on his foot, an offence for which he earns a booking once Jones mops up a Young Boys break.19 min: It’s all United. Sort of. They’re bossing possession, but Young Boys are letting them have it.16 min: Martial finds space to run into for the first time. Young Boys looked panicked at the back. Martial twists and turns and looks ready to break through on goal, only for Camara to stick out a leg and deny him just in time. United continue to press and the ball squirts through for Martial after a spot of pinball, but the flag goes up for offside. You sense it might not take much to break down this Young Boys defence. The question is whether United can keep their composure.14 min: United look threatening in attack. Fellaini, the creative midfielder we’ve been waiting for, slips a pass to Rashford, who shoots straight at Von Ballmoos from a tight angle.13 min: The cameraman picks out the tracksuited pair of Pogba and Lukaku, both of whom look thrilled with what they’re watching from their seats on the bench.12 min: Lingard lunges in a little recklessly on Benito and he’s fortunate to make no contact with the left-back. That could easily have been a red if he’d caught his opponent.9 min: This is a sloppy spell from United, who find themselves under more pressure when Fred and Lingard contrive to give the ball away in midfield. Sow darts forward, but Jones cuts out his pass.8 min: Assale cuts inside and sees a shot deflected wide from 20 yards for Young Boys’ first corner. Sulejmani takes it and United deal with it. 6 min: Fred picks up the ball on the edge of the area and whistles an effort just over. 5 min: Shaw clips a pass to Lingard. It’s overhit, but the ball flicks off Lingard and runs through to Rashford, who bursts clear with only Balmoos to beat. The Young Boys goalkeeper is miles off his line, giving Rashford a big target to hit, but the United striker lifts the ball inches over! Jose Mourinho stands with his arms folded on the touchline and shakes his head.4 min: Valencia scoots down the right and wins a free-kick. Fred lifts it high to Fellaini, who nods the ball down to Martial, but the United striker can’t get a shot away and Young Bern make off with it.2 min: The ball breaks through to Lingard on the right, but he’s miles offside.Peep! Manchester United, in red shirts and black shorts, get the game underway. There are plenty of empty seats at the Theatre of Dreams tonight. However Young Boys, in their grey shirts, have brought a noisy, colourful and sizeable following with them. “The Portuguese Dave Sexton is really spoiling us tonight,” Jon Millard says.Here come the teams. We’ll have football soon.A midfield three of Marouane Fellaini, Nemanja Matic and Fred, though. It reminds me of the Busquets-Xavi-Iniesta triumvirate actually.Breaking news: Manchester United’s team bus arrived at Old Trafford on time this evening. Signs of progress. The good times could well be on the way back.Hello and welcome to what promises to be another night of thrills and spills at Theatre of Dreams. After all, Jose Mourinho has told his players to approach this game against Group H whipping boys Young Boys like it’s a knockout tie, though he’ll be hoping they don’t take that to mean he wants them to play like it’s Sevilla at home again. Probably best he hammers that home before Manchester United take to the pitch in an hour or so, especially as you can’t really be sure what this team are going to produce these days. Oh, how they tease us. Earlier this month they were right on it, winning in the last minute at Bournemouth, then producing a stunning comeback to win at Juventus and breathe fresh life into a stuttering Champions League campaign. But they followed that with a comprehensive defeat to Manchester City in the derby before plummeting the depths again last Saturday, drawing 0-0 with Crystal Palace, who counted themselves unlucky not to leave Jose’s House of Fun with all three points.It’s three wins from nine home games now and Mourinho’s beginning to show signs of rancour again, questioning his team’s personality and character in recent days. But while it’s been a struggle in the league, at least United are enjoying themselves a bit more in Europe. It was looking dicey after their home defeat to Juventus last month, but that tribute to Turin ‘99 three weeks ago has put them in such an excellent position in the group that they could even qualify for the knockout stages with a game to spare if results go their way this evening. If United do their bit and see off Young Boys, who lost 3-0 when they hosted Mourinho’s side in September, all they’ll need is for Juventus to beat Valencia at home to be sure of a place in the last 16.Sounds feasible, doesn’t it? Even at their most laboured United would expect to beat Young Boys, who have picked up one point from their first four games, while Valencia, will be up against it in Turin. The Spaniards are two points off second-placed United – who visit the Mestalla in their final group game next month – and unfortunately don’t have a Marouane Fellaini to throw on against Juve. If everything goes as expected, this could be an excellent night for Mourinho. The only problem, of course, is you can’t take anything for granted with United these days. Keep your expectations fluid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

As things stand Edwards would then take over the main slot from Dimbleby for any election night from 2020 onwards.A BBC spokesperson declined to comment on “speculation” about presenters, including the extent of of internal preparations for a snap vote. Dimbleby’s agent did not return multiple requests for comment.Executives are said to be keen to stop preparations for an election from leaking to the media, to avoid the impression that the BBC is seen to be pre-empting ongoing political events. However, they are considering all options to ensure they are ready to activate their plans and deploy staff at short notice.As a result the corporation has inquired as to the availability of Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, where the BBC often hosts its coverage of major political events. If the studio is not available then they could be forced to host the live programme from the corporation’s New Broadcasting House headquarters, although this could require the BBC to use a scaled-down set.Issues of studio availability are complicated by the lack of a clarity on when a general election – or second EU referendum, which would require a similar level of preparation – might be held.Other concerns include potentially commissioning new graphics and ensuring exit poll teams are prepared and whether the BBC would be required to host debates between party leaders – with the corporation already potentially involved in hosting a Brexit debate next month featuring Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.Dimbleby, 80, is due to step down as host of Question Time next month with Fiona Bruce offered the chance to replace him.The Dimbleby family have been intrinsically associated with televised coverage of British general elections since 1955, when Richard Dimbleby began hosting the BBC’s programming.David Dimbleby, 80, first appeared on a BBC election night broadcast as a junior reporter in 1964 alongside his father.Richard died the following year, creating a 15-year interregnum during which the public had to cope without a Dimbleby hosting the broadcast before David was promoted to the top job.David’s brother, Jonathan, the current host of Radio 4’s Any Questions, anchored ITV’s election night coverage between 1997 and 2005, meaning that for a decade terrestrial viewers had no choice but to learn the election results from a Dimbleby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8531f8a493f3b1a38ac8153db248f690532b30d9/664_424_5312_3187/master/5312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58253ce24727dc5af1ed10e41a146b8b","title":"today in focus guardian daily podcast new host","story":"The host of the ’s new daily podcast and her team aim to inject originality and heart into the news agendaI was on maternity leave when I decided to leave my role as joint political editor to present Today in Focus – the ’s new daily podcast.

Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC. Where the Today programme tries to give you headlines, we want to give you heart.We hope to offer a mix of immediate news stories, looked at from fresh angles, alongside deep es into major, rolling stories. Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the . So please: come, try and (I hope) enjoy what we have to offer, but do also pile in with feedback and ideas.If you give us just 20 minutes of your time, we promise you will learn something relevant, interesting and new every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5053be1eb3025d0837bf91b83e0503c4be58e62/0_0_4060_3448/master/4060.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a64df1c44354814af87f4f588052024 660w","title":"theresa may heads to scotland as brexit deal founders in westminster","story":"Number of Tory MPs opposing proposal rises as PM attempts to win support around the UKTheresa May takes her Brexit publicity blitz to Scotland on Wednesday, as opponents of her deal scramble to plan for the chaotic aftermath of the meaningful House of Commons vote in less than a fortnight, which she appears likely to lose by a crushing margin.The prime minister will visit a factory near Glasgow and speak to workers and employers about the agreement, telling them: “It is a deal that is good for Scottish employers and which will protect jobs.”But back in Westminster, few MPs believe the controversial package is likely to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn’s team is planning for a range of possible scenarios as the Labour leader prepares to ramp up efforts to explain his alternative plan to the public in the coming days.Corbyn is expected to confront the prime minister in a head-to-head television debate, with Labour and Downing Street in talks with broadcasters – although Boris Johnson became the latest senior politician to argue on Tuesday that alternative voices should also be included.“Any debate must involve someone who believes in Brexit \u0026amp the British people being fully in control of their laws, rather than giving back control to the EU like the PM’s deal,” the former foreign secretary tweeted, though allies insisted it was “not about Boris”.Labour is determined to reject the idea gaining ground at Westminster of a Norway-plus deal. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said on Tuesday she hoped a majority could coalesce around the proposal, which is being promoted by the Conservative backbencher Nick Boles.But senior Conservative party sources insisted they regarded it as an unacceptable abrogation of sovereignty that would fail to honour the referendum result, won by the Vote Leave campaign with the slogan “take back control”.Sturgeon said the alternative framework for the UK, which the Scottish government first advocated in December 2016, “may have met with a disinterested rejection from the UK government but … is gathering support from others. The arguments that the Scottish government has been making are actually winning the day.”Almost half of May’s cabinet have held talks to weigh up the possibility of backing the Norway-inspired alternative, in which the UK could join the European Free Trade Association and maintain a customs arrangement with the EU if parliament rejects the prime minister’s EU withdrawal deal next month.But Labour intends to hold out for its own plan, involving a permanent customs union and a close relationship with the single market that falls short of full membership. It will also resist demands for a second referendum unless all other options have been exhausted.Fresh ammunition for MPs hoping to halt Brexit altogether may come from the government’s economic analysis of the deal, which will be published on Wednesday and is expected to echo the findings of a leaked assessment from earlier this year that showed GDP would be hit.The government was keen to stress the report, prepared by civil servants across Whitehall, constituted an “analysis” and not a “forecast”.Sturgeon said the Scottish National party would support either the Norway plan or a second referendum, whichever appeared most likely to command a majority in the Commons.Leave-leaning Tories are hoping a harder Brexit could emerge if the deal fails to pass the Commons. Several cabinet ministers, including Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, have not yet signalled their public support.The prime minister’s prospects of winning the vote on 11 December appear increasingly bleak, with 94 of her MPs pledged to vote against her.Trump’s intervention came as No 10 attempted to marshal support from MPs in the face of a chorus of condemnation at Westminster. Conservatives were briefed on the deal on Tuesday evening by May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell.Speaking in Wales on the first leg of a UK-wide tour to promote the deal directly to the British public, the prime minister said: “We will have the ability, outside the European Union, to make those decisions on trade policy for ourselves. It will no longer be a decision being taken by Brussels.“As regards the United States, we’ve already been talking to them about the sort of agreement we could have with them in the future.”However, Peter Mandelson, a former EU trade commissioner, offered unlikely support for the president’s view, declaring “Donald Trump is right”. The former Labour minister warned in an article for the  that it may not be possible to sign a trade deal with the US until the end of 2022, the last possible date for the end of the post-Brexit transition period, with the UK tied to EU trade rules before that.Hard Brexiters who dreamed of the UK becoming a “North Sea Singapore” through deregulation would be disappointed, Mandelson said, because the political declaration signed by May with the EU “agrees that Britain would closely follow EU standards and rules affecting competition”.Trade deals, Mandelson concluded, were the product of years of negotiation. “It took Donald Trump to remind the UK government that negotiating trade deals is a long, painful and necessarily complex business,” he wrote. “I can hardly believe I am writing this sentence … Donald Trump is right.”Before May arrived in Northern Ireland on the second leg of her tour on Tuesday, the Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, renewed her criticism of the Brexit deal, telling the BBC: “The disappointing thing for me is that the prime minister has given up and she is saying … we just have to accept it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e58452288269fe8f467c5ce1f23a0ad837e4aa/419_129_5133_3080/master/5133.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be67d0436e806ac2bb9967ed3b371d48","title":"brexit may deal vote confirms she wants tv debate with corbyn on deal before historic commons vote politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the start of Theresa May’s national tour to try to win support for her Brexit dealThat’s all from me for today.Comments are due to stay open until 7pm. Thanks for the contributions so far.Three weeks ago a document purporting to give details of government plans to win public support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal (which at that point still had not been finalised) was leaked to the media. Downing Street insisted that it was not an official document and that it did not represent government thinking. But, if that was the case, in some respects it has turned out be uncannily prescient.For one day on the grid, the document says:Government lining up 25 top business voices including Carolyn Fairbairn and lots of world leaders e.g Japanese PM to tweet support for the deal. Obviously the world leader thing did not work out too well with Donald Trump, but Shinzo Abe, the Japanese PM, has turned up right on queue. This morning he had a telephone conversation with May and afterwards Downing Street issued a read-out. It says:The leaders discussed the importance of free trade and close co-operation between the UK and Japan. Prime Minister Abe welcomed the progress the prime minister has made to secure an agreement with the European Union.My colleague Peter Walker has more from Sajid Javid, the home secretary, at the home affairs committee.The health committee hearing on Brexit is now over. The committee is now questioning Hancock about health spending.Back in the committee, Wollaston asks Hancock to confirm that, after Brexit, the UK will just have observer status with the European Medicines Agency. That is a significant downgrade.Hancock says he is determined to ensure that does not lead to additional costs for drug companies. As the ’s Jack Maidment reports, on the basis of what was said at the afternoon lobby Downing Street is making it clear that it is resisting calls to publish its Brexit legal advice in full, even though Labour says it must because that is what the Commons voted for. (See 11.48am.)Stevens says the fundamental drivers of health costs are bigger than anything related to Brexit.Q: Will there be extra costs to the NHS as a result of Brexit?Not that we can foresee, says Hancock.But there will be changes. Exchange rate changes make a difference.Q: And what impact will they have?Hancock says he does not know. If economic forecasts are unreliable, exchange rate forecasts are even more unreliable, he says.Q: Is there any form of Brexit that will produce lower costs for the NHS?Hancock says many of the future costs are uncertain. There are scenarios where costs are higher, and scenarios were costs are lowers.Wormald says there are clearly costs to the transition. But the factors that increase costs over the long term are the same around the world.Q: What people want to know is, is the NHS going to be okay after Brexit?Stevens says in principle there is no reason why we cannot have an excellent NHS after Brexit. But the question is, what will happen during the transition.What happens will depend on the nature of the transition, he says.And it will depend on how other countries react. How the French act will be influence by the fact that there are a third of a million French people living here.Q: But some of the stuff about people dying, and the UK running out of water, just sounds insane.Stevens says the health department can’t determine what happens to transport. But the department is “moving heaven and earth” to ensure there will be no problems.Hancock says, if everyone does what they have to do, the NHS will be fine.And the NHS will be better off because the extra £20.5bn is going into the NHS whatever happens.Q: How are we going to meet the need for staff in the social care sector after Brexit?Hancock says he does not accept that work in social care is low-skilled work. The workers are highly committed, and work with great dedication.He says he has been a big supporter of the national living wage. That has increased pay in the sector. Some of the fastest pay rises in the economy have been in that sector, because of the national living wage.He says he wants to make social care a rewarding career. There will be more on that in the social care green paper.Q: Do you accept that recruiting from outside the EU will cost more than recruiting from within the EU?Stevens says at the moment it costs more. But in the future it will depend on how the immigration system is constructed.Q: You are spending money on more warehouse space. But how will you be sure that pharmaceutical companies use it to stockpile medicines?Sir Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the Department of Health, says the department is talking to both.Q: What are the benefits of the withdrawal agreement?Hancock says it provides a smooth exit from the EU.Q: Will there be a net benefit to the NHS?Hancock says it will allow the government to deliver on the result of the referendum.Q: Will the NHS be better off?Hancock says it will be better off because an extra £20bn is going in.Q: The PM said in her letter on Sunday that the NHS would get an extra £394m a week as a result of Brexit. But organisations like Full Fact say there is no such thing as a Brexit idend.Hancock says there will be money going into the EU now that will be available for things like the NHS. He says he used to be an economic forecasters, and he has a “healthy scepticism” of the value of economic forecasts.Sarah Wollaston, the committee, says says the idea that there is a Brexit idend is “nonsense”. The UK Statistics Authority has said that.Hancock says there will be money available because the UK won’t be paying the EU. There are other arguments. But they rely on economic forecasts, and he is sceptical of those. He says in the EU referendum his side relied on forecasts about what would happen if leave one. Those forecasts were unreliable, he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82123994551f2a8676d86242d80f6be0a4e7eeca/0_49_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08165bbba14620a16f2444841c8ff31b","title":"nasa mars insight lander sends back first picture from red planet","story":"InSight probe reveals desolate landscape as dust settles after its arrival on Martian surfaceThis is the view across Elysium Planitia, the vast lava plain near the equator of Mars, where Nasa’s InSight lander touched down after a hair-raising descent on Monday.

Another instrument will burrow into the ground and take the temperature of the red planet.Hours after InSight touched down, the probe called home to say its solar panels had opened and were collecting what feeble sunlight reaches the planet. On a clear day the panels will generate 700W, enough to power a kitchen blender, and all the lander needs to operate.Taken with a clear dust cover still in place on the camera lens, the picture was beamed up from the Martian surface to Nasa’s orbiting Odyssey spacecraft, and from there sent the 91m miles (146m kilometres) to Earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

As a result, there is a push to introduce another type of vaccine called inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which involves an injection containing dead strains of the virus.While this has already happened in many countries, one big barrier to widespread use is the sensitivity of IPV to temperatures above and below about 4C (39.2F).Now researchers say they have managed to develop a way of freeze-drying IPV, such that it can be stored at elevated temperatures of up to 40C for four weeks and then dissolved for use – without losing its potency.“We freeze-dried inactivated polio vaccine and during the freeze-drying we added some ingredients that make it more stable,” said Woo-Jin Shin, a co-author of the report from the Southern University of California.Writing in the journal mBio, Shin and colleagues from the Southern University of California and a company called Integrity Bio Inc describe how the formulation includes among its ingredients magnesium sulphate, the amino acid histidine, and the sugar alcohol mannitol.The researchers then stored the dried vaccine at different temperatures and looked at how levels of particular antigens changed over time, as well as testing the vaccine on small groups of mice, with both types of experiments suggesting little change in potency of the vaccine when stored for four weeks, even at elevated temperatures.Shin said he hoped the approach would be picked up for use by charitable foundations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12dea71ccb74a0ba9f44c4a4dfa39e59eeca0cb6/0_0_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c5181134f0eef635a67ab7b51892d91","title":"clare in the community back to the drawing board","story":"Clare gives a lesson in the art of diplomacy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b795f9526d1ca8a51b31579a4c9db7b9b8de3985/0_242_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc0183b5893316aec213fb8abb6690bb","title":"brexit f1 races around europe mclaren jonathan neale","story":"• Nine F1 races to be held in Europe in 2019• ‘Border efficiency key’, says Jonathan NealeThe chief operating officer at McLaren, Jonathan Neale, has warned the result of a no-deal Brexit may put the ability of teams to stage Formula One meetings at risk. Seven of the 10 teams are based in the UK and there will be nine races in Europe next year. According to Neale, McLaren are already working with partners within the sport in an attempt to ensure they are ready to deal with potential difficulties.As things stand, parliament is set to reject the prime minister’s plan, leading to the UK leaving Europe with no deal on 29 March next year. By then, the F1 season will have started and the first European race is in Spain on 12 May. Mercedes, McLaren, Williams, Force India, Renault and Red Bull are all in the UK, while Haas have their headquarters in the USA but a base in Banbury.“The key issues will be border efficiency for both parts and people and administrative costs,” said Neale. “McLaren F1 takes 40 tons and 100 people and we pop up at an event every two weeks around the globe in 20 countries and five continents through a variety of customs borders to put the show on the road. Currently there are well-trodden paths in how we manage customs and borders in order to move seamlessly.Neale said McLaren have identified the key areas they believed may be issues in light of a no-deal Brexit. “The friction points are talent supply chain and export of our product administrative costs in coping with inefficiencies in borders and delays” he said. “We will wait and see. We are not running around being over-dramatic but we are absolutely addressing it.”Talent will be of particular concern to all teams given the international nature of F1. McLaren’s F1 team employs 800 people. Neale revealed in the engineering group alone there were 23 nationalities. Ensuring this ersity was paramount. He said: “What we would like to avoid is getting into crazy, administratively costly and time-consuming visa requirements either for retention or for future recruitment. We want to be able to hire talent on the basis of right person for the job.”Toto Wolff, Mercedes’ team principal, recently said he had concerns too for the 1,800 people employed across Mercedes motorsport in the UK, many of whom are EU citizens. Renault also face potential difficulties. They are based in Oxfordshire but their engines are manufactured in France. “If every time a border is crossed there is a transaction, it introduces a huge amount of inertia and inefficiency to our supply chain. It will be the same for everybody but as a business is something we would be keen to avoid.”Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher’s son Mick, 19, will compete in F2 next year. He will continue to race for the Prema team with whom he drove an exceptional season in this year’s Formula 3 European Championship, taking the title with eight wins and seven poles. F2 is the final proving ground in an attempt to gain a seat in F1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18dc62592f65b01622fe465e619d487b40babcc/0_319_4758_2855/master/4758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764c1c4264cb6c6aae63927d1aad2f57","title":"carlsen caruana world chess championship armageddon","story":"Twelve games. Forty-eight hours. More than 630 moves. An apparent intelligence leak. A definite black eye. There’s been nothing to separate Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana of the United States in their world championship staredown over the last three weeks in London. Every one of their 12 classical games ended in a draw, making it the first title match in which no decisive results were managed in the competition’s official 132-year history.But the historic deadlock will be resolved on Wednesday in a sound-proof studio at the College in London when the world’s top two players compete in a series of quickfire tie-breakers to determine an outright winner in the €1m (£880,000) match.If Carlsen wins, the 27-year-old will seal his third defence of the title that he captured from Viswanathan Anand in 2013. If Caruana prevails, the 26-year-old challenger will not only become the second American-born player to capture the world championship after Bobby Fischer in 1972, he will also inherit the No 1 ranking that Carlsen has held uninterrupted since July 2011.For many, the protracted impasse has proven a deeply unsatisfying spectacle, prompting broad discussions over whether the match format needs an overhaul. Public dismay reached a climax after Monday’s Game 12 when Carlsen, whose reputation was built on the ruthless punishment of opponents in marathon endgames, appeared content to settle for yet another peaceful result after 31 moves despite clear advantages in time and position.But Carlsen v Caruana – the first title showdown between the world’s No 1 and No 2 players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time – was always pitched as an evenly matched bout between two elite operators brought up in the age of computer chess and by that metric it has surely delivered. The razor-thin margin between the contestants on the scoreboard is an accurate reflection of the three points that separate them in Fide’s Elo ratings.Carlsen will play as white in Wednesday’s first tiebreak stage after the drawing of lots following Monday’s game: a best-of-four rapid match with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. (This is where the Norwegian was able to close the show after he was pushed to tie-breakers against Russia’s Sergey Karjakin two years ago in New York.)If that is not enough to settle matters, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). If all five mini-matches are drawn, it will come down to one sudden-death Armageddon match in which white receives five minutes, black receives four minutes and both will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. If that game is drawn, black will be declared the winner.Carlsen, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top-rated rapid player and top-rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), has a far better record under tighter time controls and is widely regarded as favourite. He’s a perfect nine for nine in tie-breakers going back more than a decade with the added advantage of experience on the sport’s biggest stage.Yet there have been indications Carlsen, having teetered so perilously against Karjakin in 2016, is an even further diminished player in London. His glib response to a reporter who asked if he had a favourite player from history – “Probably myself like three or four years ago,” he quipped – prompted laughter from the press gallery but was thick with confessional subtext and pathos. And no less than Garry Kasparov himself said on Monday that Carlsen’s hasty draw offer in Game 12 betrayed a lapse of spirit.“In light of this shocking draw offer from Magnus in a superior position with more time, I reconsider my evaluation of him being the favourite in rapids,” the longtime world No 1 wrote on Twitter. “Tiebreaks require tremendous nerves and he seems to be losing his.”Whoever prevails in Wednesday’s tiebreakers, it is clear the dialogue over a potential format change for the next world title match in 2020 will not be quietened anytime soon. Yet that’s a conversation for another day. When asked whether their unprecedented parade of draws, even in the package of a fiercely contested match, was bad for the sport, both Carlsen and Caruana bristled at the notion.“We work with the match that we have,” Caruana said. “If the powers that be want to change it, then we’ll work with something else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc3616e94bba04e681492ddad5a2e814c67869ef/216_3_1782_1069/master/1782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05479b972e76b506b4e699ad09239272","title":"horse racing news tips","story":"The first four finishers in all major British horse races are to be dope-tested as part of the latest extension to anti-doping measures in the sport. The British Horseracing Authority said on Tuesday it began its new policy on 1 September and has since satisfied itself that it is able to cope with the logistical challenges of such an increased workload, compared with the previous system under which only winners were automatically tested.Brant Dunshea, the BHA’s chief regulatory officer, announced the new measure during a briefing with members of the media intended to mark a new era of openness at the ruling body, previously associated with something of a siege mentality. “This is driven by a desire to enhance the integrity around the best quality races in this country,” he said, adding that the new testing policy will apply to all Group races on the Flat and Grade One races over jumps. “We hope all major racing nations will adopt a similar approach.“It comes with its own logistical challenges on days like Champions Day or during the Royal meeting and there’s significant resource redistribution to make it happen but we believe it’s really important. We’re comfortable that we can do it.”Disciplinary cases are to be processed faster in the future as the BHA attempts to leave behind its old reputation for struggling with long, complex investigations. In support of that ambition, it recently hired as its intelligence manager Nicola McDermott, described as an expert on covert policing during her time with the politan Police.It has also created a new role of intelligence development manager for John Burgess, a long-serving BHA investigator, who must now seek opportunities to “prevent and disrupt” corrupt plots before they take place, thereby reducing the need for reactive investigations.As indicators of greater openness, the BHA said it will provide more information to those who find themselves the subject of investigations. Its new integrity education programme for racing professionals will be published online next year for all to see.Thanks to its all-weather track, Lingfield Park stages more meetings each year than any racecourse in the country (81 scheduled for this year, versus 79 and 77 for Wolverhampton and Kempton Park respectively). Its primary purpose during the winter months is to keep betting ticking over if or when the weather closes in on the National Hunt programme. A jumps card performs a similar function today since the going at the Surrey track is officially good-to-soft, and soft in places on the hurdles course.\u0026nbspAs a result, the small fields that have bedevilled the jumps in recent days are largely absent. There is even an 18-runner novice hurdle on the card, which brings the average number of runners per race close to 10. There is a potential Festival contender on the cast list too, as Evidence De Thaix, whose odds for the Mares’ Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March range from 20-1 to 33-1, makes her first start over timber in the last race.\u0026nbspPhilip Hobbs’s filly won two bumpers in France before being snapped up by JP McManus but has not run since August 2017, which must be a cause for concern. She was odds-on overnight but had drifted to 11-10 this morning and at the prices, Belle Amis (3.30) makes more appeal. Fergal O’Brien’s filly is also making her first start over hurdles and the pick of her form – when third in a Listed bumper at Market Rasen in January – suggests she could also be a useful recruit to hurdling.\u0026nbspDuhallow Gesture (3.00) is a very short price in the preceding race but should make the most of a good opportunity after a promising run at Newbury last time. Rhaegar (2.30) should also go well at more attractive odds. Millie The Minx (1.20) has yet to win over hurdles but has run her best races at Sedgefield and will appreciate a drop in trip.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08d3e299a31f80fcc7994d3705442c7cbcc6ce40/1282_569_2146_1287/master/2146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=671eca5770f73c1176b451aa797bd006","title":"premiership clubs likely to agree 200m deal sell stake cvc rugby union","story":"Premiership club owners are likely to vote for a proposal to give a minority stake to the private equity firm CVC in return for more than £200m, two months after they turned down a takeover bid.CVC, which held a majority stake in Formula One between 2006 and 2017, came back with a new offer that would mean it ran the commercial arm of the Premiership but not the league itself. This would keep the agreement within World Rugby’s regulation governing ownership and mean the 12 clubs enjoyed a greater proportion of profits than under the original bid.Premiership Rugby has held talks with CVC in recent weeks and it is understood a firm offer will be tabled at the next board meeting, which is to be attended by the clubs’ owners, on 11 December. The 12 would each receive an immediate cash injection of around £20m at a time when only Exeter are in profit.The debts of most clubs have grown in recent years, largely because of wage inflation which has accounted for most of the growth in turnover. CVC’s money will not go into the pockets of players because the salary cap is pegged for the next two seasons but will be used to improve infrastructure and pay off debt.Bath are hoping to redevelop the Recreation Ground, Harlequins are planning a new stand and Leicester hope to start a £22m project next summer to build a hotel and a car park alongside their Welford Road stadium. Contracts have been exchanged with a developer and the project hinges on planning permission.While some owners have reservations about bringing in an external partner which would take out a significant chunk of the Premiership’s profit each year, others argue investment is needed if clubs are to achieve their goal of sustainability.This season Northampton posted another loss and earlier this month Wasps announced their pre-tax loss had more than doubled to £9.7m, with the club’s debt rising to £56m. The bottom line is that if every owner demanded the money owed to them be immediately repaid there would be no Premiership the Rugby Football Union is in no position to help after losing £30m last year.A question the owners have to weigh up is whether the cash injection would leave them worse off in the long term. They have to balance the money they would receive from CVC against the reduction from central funds each year –the money which is generated from television and sponsorship deals for the league. How long would it take to make up the £20m?CVC believes the tournament has undervalued itself and that the TV market in particular has been underexplored. The Premiership’s current deal with BT runs until the end of the 2020-21 season while it is in its first year with the title sponsor, Gallagher.The expectation is that CVC will tap into social media and try to engage the likes of Amazon and a greater share of young viewers, but it did not do that with F1 which next year starts a £600m, six-year deal with Sky. Critics of that agreement accused CVC of taking far more out of the sport than it put in.The clubs would continue to run the rugby side as well as policies like the rugby cap. CVC would not be able to influence the agreement Premiership Rugby has with the RFU over the management of elite players and it would not be given a position on the professional game board.One club official admitted giving CVC a stake would be a gamble, one that would not be taken without close scrutiny of what it would mean for clubs in the medium and long term. He said: “It is clearly attractive in the short term because it would provide money immediately for projects or to reduce debt, but the devil will be in the detail.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6afd079de7aba5b7a0ff90b3d45ff8cdff63a0d6/336_114_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12ca18db42e7d1b3ef3fb2770b982fb4","title":"trevor bayliss ben stokes england discipline","story":"There are not so many clouds on the horizon now for England but they will be grateful for no complications on 10 December. That is the day when they select the tour parties for the Caribbean, but just before the squads are announced the Cricket Discipline Commission is scheduled to reveal whether any further action is to be taken against Ben Stokes and Alex Hales after that episode in Bristol 15 months ago. The absence of Ben Stokes in particular would represent a considerable ner in the works.So it would be a fair assumption that Bayliss would be dismayed if deprived of his favourite all-rounder in the Caribbean, especially since the team appear to be taking shape so promisingly after their 3-0 victory in Sri Lanka. Bayliss was always a strong advocate of playing Ben Foakes, the unlikely man of the series. In turn this selection led to the possibility of Jonny Bairstow becoming England’s permanent No 3, even though this has never been an ambition of Bairstow himself.“In these conditions batting at three is no problem for Jonny,” Bayliss said. “His challenge will be when we get home on to the seaming decks but he’s certainly a very talented player and I’m sure he’ll do whatever he can to adapt his game to that position at home as well”.Bairstow appears the best and likeliest option at three and there is no doubt he will resume there when the first of the three-Test series starts in Bridgetown on 23 January. The oddity is that the more runs Bairstow scores in that position the less likely it is that he can play in his preferred role as a wicketkeeperbatsman.The opening problems have not been resolved. Asked whether Keaton Jennings and Rory Burns had nailed down their positions Bayliss said: “Probably not. It’s all about runs and wickets. They’ve shown glimpses obviously of what they can do but they’ve got more hard work ahead. I think they’ve done enough to warrant selection for the next series and some of the signs are good”.Whether Joe Denly travels to the West Indies as another top-order option is more debatable. It would be tough on him to be omitted on the basis of mediocre performances in a couple of damp, inconsequential practice games in Colombo, but fairness is not the ultimate criteria in selection. The name of Jason Roy, who could be another convert from the ODI side, was mentioned. “He’s been spoken about, so he’s getting close” was as far as Bayliss would go.The identity of the bowlers is unlikely to change. It was “very possible” that England may play three spinners again during the series. “There’s a few wickets over there that take spin,” said Bayliss, who like his captain, Joe Root, has been constantly stressing the need to be adaptable and flexible. The great bonus is England currently have the sort of personnel who allow them to tinker with the balance of the side at will – especially when Stokes is fit and available.

Now it’s a light but powerful operating system, with Android and Linux app support.The Pixel Slate is Google’s attempt to show that Chrome OS can pull double duty as both an entertainment tablet operating system and a serious desktop-class workhorse.On the outside the Pixel Slate is about as simple as tablets get. The front is filled with a crisp and beautiful 12.3in high-density LCD screen that’s as good as you’d find on top-end laptops.A relatively wide and uniform bezel frames the screen and houses a webcam in the top and a pair of fairly powerful stereo speakers in the left and right sides. The screen’s Gorilla Glass 5 rounds off into an aluminium body, which feels comfortable to hold for extended periods.Flip the tablet over to find the dark blue aluminium back is oddly featureless, marked only by a subtle “G” logo in top left corner and a camera in the top right.The bottom of the tablet has a magnetic connector for slotting into the keyboard case, while the power button in the top left doubles as fingerprint scanner and works well.The Pixel Slate is 7mm thick, which is 1.5mm thinner than Microsoft’s Surface Pro 6, but 1.1mm thicker than the new 12.9in Apple iPad Pro. The Google tablet weighs 726g, which is 50g lighter than the Surface Pro 6, but almost 100g heavier than the iPad Pro. The Pixel Slate is thin and light for a PC, but bigger and heavier than most media tablets.The model tested had a 1.3GHz Intel Core i5 (8200Y) processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.The point of Chrome OS is that it provides a good experience on cheap, low-end hardware. Give it relatively powerful components and it absolutely flies.The Core i5 version tested handled everything you can do with Chrome OS with aplomb. No amount of Chrome tabs brought it to a crawl. Heavy duty web apps, such as content management systems and other tools, flew. You can run as many extensions as you like with Chrome with no noticeable performance impact.All the Android apps ran as fast as they would on a modern smartphone too, including games such as Shadowgun Legends, although the tablet reached around 50C at its peak and felt pretty hot to touch.Battery life was excellent for a work tablet, lasting close to 10 hours between charges when used like a laptop, with 10 or so Chrome tabs open alongside various chat, imaging and media apps.Opening up the machine at 9am, the Pixel Slate would last all the way through the heaviest of work days and still have enough charge for a movie on the way home.It’ll charge via either of the USB-C ports in the left and right sides, and took about two and a half hours to fully charge from flat while being used.On the face of it, the predominantly mouse and keyboard-driven Chrome OS appears an odd choice for a tablet, but over the past few years Google has pushed Android app integration and made lots of touch-centric tweaks.Chrome OS on the Pixel Slate has two modes: a desktop experience enabled when you attach a keyboard and mouse, and a Android-like tablet mode when used on its own.As a desktop the Pixel Slate behaves like any modern Chrome OS device. A shelf at the bottom of the screen shows your pinned and running app icons, there’s a start-menu-like “launcher” button in the bottom left and a system tray in the right with an Android-like notification shade. Apps open as windows, and can be arranged however you like.Press the launcher button and up pops a search box and some AI-powered app suggestions for what you might need at that moment. Swipe up or press the up arrow to see all your apps, or just start typing to find an app, file or to search the web. It’s a familiar experience for anyone who has used Windows 10 or MacOS.Grab the tablet on its own and the interface switches to look like Android with the launcher becoming the homescreen filled with apps and folders. A back button appears in the bottom left and the overview button in the bottom right.Tap an app from the homescreen and it launches in full-screen. The dock stays at the bottom of the screen with pinned and currently running apps. Hit the overview button to zoom out and see running apps in a screen that looks like the multitasking view from MacOS or Android, which is where you can jump into another app or run two side-by-side in splitscreen.Scrolling with your finger is super smooth, as are the animations, while bigger tap targets and familiar swiping gestures make it feel much more a mobile tablet. But this is still full Chrome, not a cut-down mobile version, giving you the best, most powerful browsing experience on any platform. It’s a joy to use.Android apps are a bit more of a mixed bag. Most run as they do on a real Android tablet but some have quirks, such as Citymapper and Wire refusing to run in landscape.Netflix works fine, but even it has oddities such as failing to recognise an ethernet connection as akin to wifi, meaning you have to uncheck “download only on wifi” to store shows offline.Sky’s Q app also crashes while streaming TV, sending you back to the media select screen periodically. As far as Android app support on Chrome OS has come, it’s still a work in progress.The Pixel Slate keyboard has one of the best typing experiences I have used, with backlit keys, solid travel, good feel and spacing. The only thing missing are delete and track skip media buttons, but these are minor quibbles. The large, smooth and responsive trackpad is good too.The keyboard attaches to the bottom and back of the Slate via reassuringly strong magnets, holding it at a relatively large range of viewing angles – far better than most other folding folio-style tablet stands.Unfortunately when closed the keyboard side slides around against the screen, which might end up scratching the display and feels less than reassuring when carried.The Pixelbook Pen is the same stylus that launched with the Pixelbook last year, with Google Assistant features and a solid on-screen writing experience with low lag, tilt and pressure sensitivity.It’s a bit thick and unbalanced for my liking, but is useful for signing documents or making quick sketches. I don’t think it’s a must-buy with the Pixel Slate, but then I’m not trying to use it for illustration or design.Annoyingly there’s nowhere to reliably attach it to the tablet or the folio keyboard, so the potential for losing it is high.The Google Pixel Slate comes in various processor and memory configurations starting at £549 with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage or £649 for 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.Variants with eighth-generation Intel processors start at £749 with a Core m3, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, £969 for a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and topping out at £1,549 for a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.The Pixel Slate Keyboard costs £189 and the Pixelbook Pen £99.The Pixel Slate makes a very convincing argument for the death of Android tablets. Turning the desktop-class experience of Chrome OS into a mobile, finger-friendly operating system brings the best of both worlds together in one neat package. At least in theory. Most of it works really, really well. But it is a case of trial and error for Android apps to see what works and what doesn’t.If you need to get stuff done, and you primarily do so in a browser with additional little bits of software such as Evernote, chat apps or the like, the Pixel Slate is a productivity powerhouse when in laptop mode. The Keyboard folio is therefore an essential purchase adding £189 to the cost of the machine.But I was pleasantly surprised by how good the tablet experience was on the Pixel Slate. There are quirks, a few apps need a bit of work, and a few things are missing from the standard Android experience, but having a thoroughly touch-adapted desktop-class Chrome at your fingertips is wonderful. The Pixel Slate offers the best, most powerful browsing experience of any device.Chrome OS is still a work in progress and there will be the occasional thing you’ll still need a full Windows PC to do, but what the Pixel Slate offers already is worth buying if you want to be on the bleeding edge. Just don’t expect every app and game to offer the most polished experience despite the premium price.Pros: long battery life, the best browsing experience, great screen, good keyboards, frequent software updates, USB-CCons: some apps behave weirdly, Chrome OS still can’t do everything a Windows PC can, expensive This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Now, the director has turned his wild imagination to TV in bittersweet comedy KiddingMichel Gondry accepts that life is a struggle. His films – Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep and Mood Indigo, with Audrey Tautou – have a child’s sense of wonder and the soul of a neurotic, their papier-mache stop-motion reveries never quite patching over the holes in his characters’ hearts.On an ordinary morning in Los Angeles, where the 55-year-old French film-maker recently finished work on the dark comedy series Kidding, which starts on Sky Atlantic on 29 November, Gondry just wants a simple coffee and croissant. But his sugar packet won’t open and neither will the strawberry jam. After much ripping and stabbing, his side of the table is coated in sticky crystals and his butter knife looks like a murder weapon. Gondry waves away the chaos. His sticky, human fingerprints are on everything he touches – why not his breakfast, too?Perhaps because of Gondry’s penchant for making wild animations out of everyday materials such as cardboard and felt, even the decision to order an inferior frozen croissant over the local avocado toast seems to imply a quirky defiance: he’ll survive in Hollywood on his own terms. “My home would be Paris, but if I go there I will be depressed,” says Gondry. “Here, when I want to do something, it is very easy to make things move. In Paris, it is much heavier. I like to do my ideas right away.”Gondry is happiest when his hands are busy, whether animating construction paper for the opening credits of Kidding, or crafting silent short films for his three-year-old daughter. For her birthday, he rented a screening room and a jazz musician and read the subtitles aloud while she sat on his lap. Other projects force him to hold his tongue, including a music video he made with Beyoncé, which was shelved. “I’m not supposed to talk about her,” he sighs. “I signed a nondisclosure – but I don’t care.”When Gondry first moved to the US to direct music videos in the 1990s for the likes of Björk, the White Stripes and Beck, he barely spoke English. Bands would hand him their lyrics, and he’d understand only one word in 10. So he filled in the gaps with his imagination, creating a string of inimitable fever dreams that somehow captured the song perfectly – such as the dancers in skeleton suits wiggling up and down stairs to Daft Punk’s Around the World.From there, Gondry springboarded into movies. His first feature, Human Nature, starred Patricia Arquette as a hair-covered nudist seeking a mate, and flopped. Gondry poured his frustrations into a diary. On the left side of the book, he would write down a problem with the film, such as the one identified by a reviewer, who said it didn’t breathe. “The critiques that hurt are generally the ones that are true,” he admits. Then on the right-hand side, he wrote his proposed solution. Gondry reread the journal every day while making his second film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. That film reoriented his career, proving that the MTV wunderkind could grapple with adult emotions of love and loss. Over the past decade and a half, its reputation has grown from being a cult marvel to one of the landmark masterpieces of the new millennium.“Eternal Sunshine started quite small and grew and grew,” he says. Jim Carrey’s role as a depressive ex-boyfriend established that the blockbuster comedian was also capable of romantic tragedy. Now Carrey is the star of Kidding, Gondry’s first TV show (apart from a single episode of Flight of the Conchords). It is an impish, howling, heartbroken comedy-drama. Carrey plays Jeff, a superstar kids’ TV host known as Mr Pickles, who is smiling his way to a mental breakdown.On screen, Mr Pickles and his puppet friend Uke-Larry sing songs about friendship in the service of a $100m family business that also employs his father and sister. “Isn’t growing up funny and sweet?” he coos. Not really. Off screen, Jeff’s teenage son is dead, and he is suffocating from the pressure to soothe the public. He has worn his Mr Pickles mask for so long that no one, not even him, knows how to rip it off. His ex-wife complains, correctly, that his stubborn cheer forced her to mourn their boy alone.“Kids know the sky is blue. They need to know what to do when it’s falling,” Jeff insists to his dad, the show’s CEO, asking to grapple with his tragedy on air. But Jeff’s father vetoes his honesty. “Jeff needs to heal,” he counters. “Mr Pickles is fine.”Gondry is more sympathetic to Mr Pickles’ plight. He agrees that children shouldn’t be shielded from calamity. “Since I was six, I panicked about infinity, the sun, the stars, all that,” he says. “I thought if you were dead, you had reached the end of time.” As well as being plagued by existential terror, Gondry has an innocent side, too. Show creator Dave Holstein scripted a running joke about how Jeff is too naive to understand what the “p” stands for (“pussy”) in the phrase “p-hound”, which a lothario crew member (played by Danny Trejo) has bronzed on a necklace. Gondry didn’t get the gag either. “It took me a while to understand that joke,” he says with a groan. “I was ashamed, too shy to ask some questions. It could make me look stupid to ask that.”It’s 14 years since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind brought Gondry and Carrey together. Carrey says: “He, for me, was the linchpin. I was incredibly interested in the material, but when Michel came on board, I thought, ‘I get to go play with a teammate, and that’s really wonderful.’ It was a thrill.”“We wanted to work together again,” Gondry says, “but we had never found the right script.” Instead, he dabbled in a comic-book film, 2011’s The Green Hornet starring Seth Rogen, which put a handcrafted spin on a factory-stamped product. Audiences weren’t sure what to make of the result, and Gondry didn’t fight to make a sequel. It wasn’t that he felt awkward about selling out. “I think it’s happy to be popular,” he says. “I would rather be the potato than the cabbage.” Yet he was wary of the hold huge franchises have on the cultural imagination. “I don’t believe in superheroes,” he says. “I think it’s a worse way of being a nerd. I’ve been to Comic-Con two times, and all those kids dressed as Spider-Man and Batman, I feel bad for them, because they should dress in their own character.”Meanwhile, Carrey has spent years scaling back his acting to unearth his deeper creative inspirations, which have given rise to vivid, grotesque paintings of Donald Trump, almost as if he and Gondry were destined to reconnect over their shared passion for arts and crafts. “He said there is nothing that makes him happier than to wake up in the morning, take his notebook, his drawing pad, his Sharpies or markers, and draw. I totally understand that,” says Gondry. “We talk about art at this level, not art with a big A.”Carrey, he says, is a Hollywood titan who’s prepared to get vulnerable. “You look at what they call the A-list and you have all these actors who carry this obligation of being cool. It’s hard for me to identify with them because they are a sort of elite,” he adds. “Jim and I have both aged. He is a bit more damaged. When he started, he had a rubber face. He could imitate people, contract his muscles, just amazing. But as you get older, the skin gets a little more dry, so when he moves you see what’s underneath. He doesn’t really like to see himself like that, but I see little glimpses of sadness, loneliness, and I bring them out.”He certainly has a different idea of what an avuncular hero looks like. “The nicest American is Noam Chomsky,” pronounces Gondry. He got to know the activitst and philosopher while making the experimental documentary Is the Man Who Is Tall Happy?, in which Gondry bombarded Chomsky with questions about the definition of a tree and the existence of pure truth, and Chomsky’s answers are animated in marker pen. He still tugs on Chomsky’s sleeve over email. “We talk about Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. They mixed apparently in the south of Italy. There are people who have traces of Neanderthal!”As Gondry heads back home to play with construction paper, perhaps the waiters cleaning up his breakfast wreckage might wonder if he, too, is fully evolved. Absolutely not – which is why audiences adore him.• Kidding begins on Sky Atlantic on 29 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8898959573f6b9856a2d7f1764081e37b534e7/0_187_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff9a147d8c675f7416fedaf11d3730ce","title":"manafort held secret talks with assange in ecuadorian embassy","story":"Trump ally met WikiLeaks founder months before emails hacked by Russia were publishedDonald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump’s campaign, the  has been told.Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump’s push for the White House.It is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed. But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.A well-placed source has told the  that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016. Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.In a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met. Assange described the story as a hoax.Manafort was jailed this year and was thought to have become a star cooperator in the Mueller inquiry. But on Monday Mueller said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the FBI, despite agreeing to cooperate two months ago in a plea deal. According to a court document, Manafort had committed “crimes and lies” on a “variety of subject matters”.His defence team says he believes what he has told Mueller to be truthful and has not violated his deal.Manafort’s first visit to the embassy took place a year after Assange sought asylum inside, two sources said.According to the sources, Manafort returned to the embassy in 2015. He paid another visit in spring 2016, turning up alone, around the time Trump named him as his convention manager. The visit is tentatively dated to March.Manafort’s 2016 visit to Assange lasted about 40 minutes, one source said, adding that the American was casually dressed when he exited the embassy, wearing sandy-coloured chinos, a cardigan and a light-coloured shirt.Visitors normally register with embassy security guards and show their passports. Sources in Ecuador, however, say Manafort was not logged.Embassy staff were aware only later of the potential significance of Manafort’s visit and his political role with Trump, it is understood.The revelation could shed new light on the sequence of events in the run-up to summer 2016, when WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of emails hacked by the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency. Hillary Clinton has said the hack contributed to her defeat.The previously unreported Manafort-Assange connection is likely to be of interest to Mueller, who has been investigating possible contacts between WikiLeaks and associates of Trump including the political lobbyist Roger Stone and Donald Trump Jr.One key question is when the Trump campaign was aware of the Kremlin’s hacking operation – and what, if anything, it did to encourage it. Trump has repeatedly denied collusion.Earlier this year Mueller indicted 12 GRU intelligence officers for carrying out the hack, which began in March 2016.In June of that year WikiLeaks emailed the GRU via an intermediary seeking the DNC material. After failed attempts, Vladimir Putin’s spies sent the documents in mid-July to WikiLeaks as an encrypted attachment.According to sources, Manafort’s acquaintance with Assange goes back at least five years, to late 2012 or 2013, when the American was working in Ukraine and advising its Moscow-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych. Why Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear. During this period the veteran consultant was involved in black operations against Yanukovych’s chief political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, whom Yanukovych had jailed. Manafort ran an extensive lobbying operation featuring European former politicians.He flew frequently from the US to Ukraine’s capital, Kiev – usually via Frankfurt but sometimes through London, flight records seen by the  show.Manafort is currently in jail in Alexandria, Virginia. In August a jury convicted him of crimes arising from his decade-long activities in Ukraine. They include large-scale money laundering and failure to pay US tax. Manafort pleaded guilty to further charges in order to avoid a second trial in Washington.As well as accusing him of lying on Monday, the special counsel moved to set a date for Manafort to be sentenced.One person familiar with WikiLeaks said Assange was motivated to damage the Democrats campaign because he believed a future Trump administration would be less likely to seek his extradition on possible charges of espionage. This fate had hung over Assange since 2010, when he released confidential US state department cables. It contributed to his decision to take refuge in the embassy.According to the dossier written by the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, Manafort was at the centre of a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” between the Trump campaign and Russia’s leadership. The two sides had a mutual interest in defeating Clinton, Steele wrote, whom Putin “hated and feared”.As a candidate Trump warmly welcomed the dump of DNC emails by Assange. In October 2016 he declared: “I love WikiLeaks.” Trump’s comments came after WikiLeaks released a second tranche of emails seized from the email account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman.The Trump White House subsequently sent out mixed messages over Assange and his legal fate. In 2017 and behind the scenes Assange tried to reach a deal with Trump’s Department of Justice that might see him avoid US prison.In May 2017, , Manafort flew to Ecuador to hold talks with the country’s president-elect Lenín Moreno. The discussions, days before Moreno was sworn in, and before Manafort was indicted – were ostensibly about a large-scale Chinese investment.However, one source in Quito suggests that Manafort also discreetly raised Assange’s plight. Another senior foreign ministry source said he was sceptical Assange was mentioned. At the time Moreno was expected to continue support for him.Last week a court filing released in error suggested that the US justice department had secretly charged Assange with a criminal offence. Written by the assistant US attorney, Kellen Dwyer, the document did not say what Assange had been charged with or when the alleged offence took place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656de1eb159b613e647a3ffede2a200fe1f41cad/0_627_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68744e6a4014f1e48c20f574e101e543","title":"ireland closes peat bogs climate change","story":"Shift to renewables is too late say campaigners as peatlands will still emit greenhouse gasesWhen the semi-state company that harvests Ireland’s peatlands recently announced the closure of 17 bogs, the news was greeted as the end of an era. Turning the soggy landscape that covers much of Ireland’s midlands into a fuel source had been a great national project, an ambitious undertaking launched by the republic’s founding fathers in the 1930s. Draining and cutting hundreds of thousands of hectares of turf on an industrial scale generated desperately needed jobs and reduced dependence on oil imports for almost a century.So there was some nostalgia last month when Bord na Móna, the peat-harvesting company, announced it was closing 17 of its “active bogs” and would close the remaining 45 within seven years. Nostalgia but also acceptance, given the growing awareness that harvesting peat emits greenhouse gases that worsen climate change, requiring a shift to renewable energy. “Decarbonisation is the biggest challenge facing this planet,” said Tom Donnellan, the company’s chief executive.The announcement followed promises by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to make Ireland a global leader in protecting the planet, backed by a €22bn (£19.5bn) government plan for climate action. A progressive force on social issues, Ireland would also become a beacon for the environment.The problem, according to environmentalists and academics, is that it is all hot air. Renouncing bog harvesting, they say, is too little, too late – a false solace because the ravaged peatlands will continue to emit greenhouse gases. And the government’s climate leadership pledge, they say, does not cancel out a dismal environmental record that has left Ireland potentially facing up to €600m in fines for missing emissions targets.John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University, said: “Climate change requires long-term thinking but the political cycle is much shorter and that of economically vested interest groups is shorter still.”Peatlands, formed by the accumulation of decayed vegetation, help regulate the climate by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing carbon within the peat. As fuel, it is more damaging than coal, generating less energy when burned while producing higher carbon emissions. Depending on how it is calculated, the peat industry contributes between 3m and 6m of the 62m tonnes of greenhouse gases that Ireland emits each year.Pat Sammon, a spokesman at the company’s headquarters in Newbridge, County Kildare, on the edge of the 370 sq miles of the Bog of Allen, said: “We’re heading to a new era because the main business of the company had been extracting peat and that’s falling away now.”But environmental experts are unimpressed. “It’s a bit of a smokescreen. It’s all revenue-driven,” said Florence Renou-Wilson, a research scientist and peatland expert at University College Dublin. Bord na Móna was closing bogs that were exhausted and no longer profitable, she said. “They’re all done and dusted.”The company was seeking new markets for peat in horticulture, she said, and, worse, it seldom “re-wet” used bogs, so the ravaged land continued to emit greenhouse gases. “They’ve just been leaving them abandoned.”Harvested peatlands – Bord na Móna’s as well as those developed by private operators – produce about 2.6m tonnes of “fugitive” emissions a year. Rehabilitation could make many of the bogs carbon neutral or even carbon sinks. Catherine O’Connell, the head of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, said Bord na Móna’s decarbonisation talk was spin. “It’s genius what they’ve done. They’ve come out of this looking green. But they’re miners – they remove the living surface of the bog and dig down. Death by a thousand cuts.”As an environmental policy goal, ending the cutting and burning of peat should have been “low-hanging fruit”, said Tony Lowes, the director of the group Friends of the Irish Environment. “But we have struggled to truly bring it under control because of its emotional attachment and cultural heritage.”Environmentalists say this fits a pattern of state authorities ducking climate commitments. Ireland emits 13 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person a year, the third-highest level in the EU. The UK emits eight tonnes per person.Last month, David Boyd, a UN special rapporteur on human rights, said Dublin’s failure to tackle climate change breached human rights. He made the comments in a legal submission to support a court case brought by Friends of the Irish Environment, accusing the government of “knowingly contributing to dangerous levels of climate change”.Earlier this year, Varadkar raised expectations of a rise in carbon tax, widely seen as a basic, vital step to curbing emissions. But last month’s budget left it unchanged at €20 a tonne.Critics said the government flunked climate commitments for fear of a voter backlash, a pattern set when it backed a dramatic surge in dairy and beef farming, pleasing rural voters and business interests but derailing emission goals.Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action and environment, acknowledged last week that Ireland was “far off course” and announced a plan to make every department responsive to climate change.• This article was amended on 27 November 2018 because an earlier version mistakenly said the power plant in Edenderry no longer burns peat.

Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3712386.1543337688!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained what is the norway model and is it an option for the uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorway has large fishing and agricultural industries and forms its own policy over these sectors by remaining outside the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy or Common Agricultural Policy. File photograph: iStock“Norway” has been floated as a possible “plan B” for Brexit because of the level of opposition in the UK parliament to the draft agreement signed off by the EU and UK. It is being considered because Norway’s relationship is as close as a country can get to the European Union without actually being a member. It could also be used as a template to follow to keep trading relations as close as they are now. It is helpful too because it is an existing off-the-shelf model and regarded as a type of soft Brexit that could readily be used to avoid a disorderly no-deal scenario if, as expected, the UK parliament votes down the draft orce deal. A Norway-style agreement could stand until a separate EU-UK trade agreement is resolved, according to its supporters.Norway is along with Lichtenstein and Iceland a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) which gives it full access to the EU single market, guaranteeing very limited restrictions to trade with the EU. (Switzerland is also a member of EFTA but it is not a member of the EEA.) In return, Norway makes substantial contributions to the EU budget and has to follow many EU rules and laws, but it has no say in how those rules are formed.Norway has large fishing and agricultural industries and forms its own policy over these sectors by remaining outside the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy or Common Agricultural Policy. A similar arrangement for the UK would appeal to London as it would be able to set its own policy on these important sectors. Norway can negotiate trade deals with other countries around the world, which would appeal to pro-Brexit supporters, and it has agreed such agreements as a group with other EFTA countries. A Norway-type agreement would mean that the UK would not be ruled over by the European Court of Justice, another red-line issue for Brexiteers. By signing up to EU single market rules, Norway agrees to the four freedoms - the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people so it might cross another UK red line: the British government’s desire to retain control over its own borders and a say in who it lets into the country. Being a “rules taker” – following EU rules without having a say in drafting them – will not appeal to many Brexiteers because it does not give London control over its own economic rules. The UK would still be held accountable by the EFTA court, so it would not be completely free of the EU.No. Further steps would be needed because Norway is not in the customs union. To resolve the contentious issue of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, the UK would also have to agree a customs arrangement with the EU. This means the UK would have to have what is called a “Norway-plus” solution. This could limit its ability to negotiate its own trade deals.It was ruled out because it did not tick Theresa May’s boxes for the kind of Brexit she wants: she has promised to take the UK out of both the single market and the customs union. British MPs are floating the idea of a short-term Norway-type deal, including some form of temporary customs union with the EU, as a kind of holding arrangement until the UK and EU reach their own trade deal and to avoid a messy no-deal scenario if the current draft agreement is shot down by parliament. However it is not clear whether the other EEA members or the EU would consider a temporary solution of this kind, or what could be negotiated before the UK’s exit date.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

gere appears russian business conference women given","story":"Richard Gere attends the 2018 Synergy Global Forum in MoscowRichard Gere made an unlikely appearance at a star-studded business forum in Moscow, which he described as a city of light.The event, on Monday, caused controversy after twin female business assistants were offered as a contest prize.Organisers from the Synergy business school told The  that “there should not be any information about Richard Gere” in its coverage because of a condition in his contract allowing them to “invite only Russian press”.Gere, 69, known for roles in films including Pretty Woman, was perhaps an unusual booking as the headline speaker at the Synergy Global Forum, which also featured MMA fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov, author Malcolm Gladwell, actor Steven Seagal and the human-like robot Sophia.Tickets ranged from £175 to more than £5,000 for VIP access.The Hollywood leading man told the crowd at Moscow\u0027s Olympic stadium largely about his acting career and Buddhist beliefs.He called on Vladimir Putin to bring the Dalai Lama, who addressed last year\u0027s Synergy forum by video, to Russia.At the forum, Gere also said Moscow, which was “dark and repressive” when he first visited in 1989, was now a “city of light” that “feels like it\u0027s a part of Europe”. But Russians should remember that “we\u0027re all in the same boat,” rather than try to be the strongest or most important, he added.Gere starred with Julia Roberts in the 1990 film Pretty WomanOrganisers said they did not know how much Mr Gere had been paid, but past honorariums have been hefty. Synergy gave American motivational speaker Tony Robbins $1 million (£785,000) to talk to a sold-out crowd of 26,000 people at Olympic stadium in September, the school\u0027s director has previously said.Organisers denied that Gere was trying to keep his Moscow appearance out of English-language headlines.“If you take any big star, they almost all have this, it\u0027s about raising media interest in this person in each inidual country,” one said. “They want there to be an interest for him to come speak in person in other countries.”Representatives for Gere did not immediately reply to requests for comment. This year\u0027s forum also awarded prizes in a year-long “business marathon”.While the top-scoring entrepreneur was to receive a Moscow flat and the runner-up a Lexus automobile, third place was advertised as “twin business assistants for a year” with a photograph of two blondes in red blazers and low-cut tops.Announcing the awards on Tuesday, Grigory Avetov, the Synergy director, complained that he had been unfairly accused of chauvinism over the twin assistants.Instead, the third-place winner would get to make a business presentation at Olympic stadium, he said. He later claimed that the twins were “included as a prize more as a joke”.Founded in 1988, the Synergy business school has become the largest private institution of higher learning in Russia and claims that its annual forum is the “biggest business event in the world”.British billionaire Richard Branson, boxer Mike Tyson and filmmaker Oliver Stone are among the Western celebrities who have appeared.Please review our commenting policyCaptured Ukranian sailors broadcast giving \u0026#39confessions\u0026#39 on Russian televisionBoris Johnson: Brexit TV debate must include a proper

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHLast year the festival was headlined by The Cure, Roger Waters, Eric Clapton, Michael Buble, Bruno Mars and Paul Simon, and also featured performances from Richard Ashcroft, Van Morrison, Interpol, Editors, Slowe and Khalid.Reviewing The Cure last year,\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspsaid: The first half of the set saw an emotional, note-perfect rendition of \u0027In Between Days\u0027\u0026nbsplead, quite breathtakingly, straight into \u0027Just Like Heaven\u0027.It was a perfect set, taking in some of the best songs of The Cure’s career and showing a poignant understanding of what fans might be most desperate to hear live. Closing with blistering performances of “Killing An Arab” and “10.15 Saturday Night”, the band cemented their immortality and saw those goths leave the gates of Hyde Park on the highest of highs: perhaps a little sunburned, but thrilled nonetheless.Got sweaty palms already?

If you’re a female considering higher education, you’re likely to feel reassured by the overwhelmingly positive gains. But for young men, signing up to tens of thousands of pounds of debt might not seem as attractive.\u0026nbspThe government data, which has been analysed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), suggests that thousands of men are enrolling on university courses each year that leave them worse off in future earnings\u0026nbspby\u0026nbspthe end of their twenties than their peers who opted to avoid higher education altogether.\u0026nbspIt is likely to reignite the age-old debate about whether university is worth it – especially for a specific group of male undergraduates. Men\u0026nbspwith low prior attainment, and no science or maths A-levels, only saw a small rise (4 per cent) in their earnings at age 29 compared with peers who went straight to work.Top university gives ‘no significant earnings boost to male students’And the picture for all male graduates is most stark in subjects\u0026nbsplike creative arts, English and philosophy, where they actually earn less than their peers who are not saddled with student debt. \u0026nbspThe data shows that studying philosophy at the University of Sussex leaves male graduates with the worst returns (-73 per cent), while computing at the University of Westminster (-66 per cent) is the worst for female graduates.\u0026nbspCreative arts courses at higher education institutions also feature in the bottom five for both male and female graduates for their earnings return, the figures show.\u0026nbspWhile the data may be depressing to some, it is no helpful that prospective students at least have more transparency around salary outcomes for different subjects. The introduction of £9,250 a year tuition fees has made this more pressing. \u0026nbspHowever, there is a danger that a focus\u0026nbspsolely on earnings potential could distract\u0026nbspfrom some of the other benefits of higher education that cannot be as easily measured.\u0026nbspStudents may be put off from studying creative arts because of poor financial outcomes. But this is not everything. Many who\u0026nbspgraduate in that subject\u0026nbspmay go on to contribute hugely\u0026nbspto the arts industry – and perhaps even\u0026nbspbecome stars of the West End in due course – even though their earnings in their twenties may not indicate\u0026nbspsuccess later in their career. \u0026nbspUniversities are only better for women because we have more to loseTop university gives ‘no significant earnings boost to male students’University ‘leaves male graduates in some subjects worse off’Certainly many in the higher education sector argue that a snapshot of earnings at age 29 does not tell the full picture.So yes, the data offers useful insights\u0026nbsp– especially for students making decisions about what and where to study. And universities that are offering courses\u0026nbspgenerally known to increase earnings, like economics, but that\u0026nbspfail to get significantly positive returns for students should be held to account. \u0026nbspBut it is important not to jump the gun. Going to university should not all be about salaries, and context is needed when judging institutions – especially specialist arts providers –\u0026nbspon outcomes.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So the (economic) returns for a woman in going to university are relatively bigger than they are for men.”Men without a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)\u0026nbspA-level, with lower prior attainment, receive even lower returns from attending university –\u0026nbsponly a 4 per cent increase in their earnings compared to peers who did not attend university.This group is more likely to take lower-returning subjects on average, end up earning less money\u0026nbspwhen they study the same subject, and study at lower-status universities.In 2016-17, just over 128,000 male students enrolled in creative arts, English, philosophy, agriculture, communications and languages – among the seven lowest-returning subjects. The number of male psychology students was not available from the Higher Education Statistics Agency.The earnings calculations were made by looking at the earnings of graduates from the middle 50 per cent of institutions – those in the 25th to the 75th\u0026nbsppercentile.The report also highlights great variation between courses\u0026nbspat universities. For example, men who study economics at the highest-returning institution see their earnings almost doubled – but at the lowest-returning university, the earnings for male graduates are reduced by 23 per cent.Mr Gyimah has called on the OfS to do more to expose the university courses that do not deliver value. He said: “We have got to put that out there so prospective students know –\u0026nbspand to force the university to actually delist that course, or actually improve the course.”“I believe that transparency is the best disinfectant here,” he added.The minister said\u0026nbspuniversities need to deliver courses that are employer-focused and\u0026nbsprecognised by the industry. “We have got to improve the quality of the university offering so that it delivers for students who are investing a significant amount of money into their education,” he said.A spokesperson for the National Union of Students (NUS) said: “There is a danger that, amidst calls for greater transparency in how fee income is spent, the ‘value’\u0026nbspof a degree is reduced to solely inidual financial outcomes. It risks neglecting the other substantial benefits that a university education can give to both the student and society.”They added: “Some of our greatest institutions –\u0026nbspsuch as Guildhall School of Music and Drama – attract the lowest financial return. This is because an arts career attracts a lower salary, not because of the quality of the university’s teaching. I find it hard to believe that anybody could argue that an institution that gave the world actors such as Daniel Craig and Jodie Whittaker is failing it’s students.“The government has already moved the burden of fee income entirely onto the inidual student, and now is threatening to limit the opportunities for young people to add to Britain’s rich cultural and artistic heritage by falsely conflating what a student earns with the value of their education to both themselves and society as a whole.”Created with Sketch.Best Universities for Life Sciences and Medicine Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “This study shows that for many people – and women in particular – going to university enhances both their employability and earnings potential.“However, the focus on what’s in someone’s pay packet at age 29 ignores the wider benefits of being a graduate: building networks, growing in confidence, developing life skills, the joy of learning as well as enhancing career opportunities and earnings over a lifetime, including a higher chance of being employed.”He added: “It is incorrect to assume all iniduals have higher salaries in the early part of their careers as their primary motivation. Many graduates work in vital roles in the public and charitable sectors or creative industries that make hugely valuable contributions to society and enrich our lives.“What this data highlights is the real need for those entering higher education to have the best possible information to help them choose what and where to study – but earnings are not the sole measure of learning outcomes.\u0026nbsp“Universities UK has called for the government to work in partnership with universities, colleges and schools to provide clear and tailored information to prospective students on the costs and benefits of higher education.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the new report showed there are still “clear financial benefits” in getting a university degree.“It is crucial that prospective students have access to high quality information about where, what and how they might study,” said Ms Dandridge. “This research provides a wealth of data to let students understand how the course and institution they choose may affect their earnings potential.”She added: “Of course, better financial prospects are only one reason why people go to university. Higher education also delivers important social and educational benefits to inidual students and society as a whole. There are also many rewarding careers that may not attract high salaries, especially early in someone’s career.“But universities should scrutinise this data carefully, and some will need to ask themselves tough questions about how well they are preparing students for life after graduation.”Office for StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Musk\u0027s rocket business is preparing for manned trips to Mars in the coming years, with the hope of making them relatively easily available.Do we really have a right to colonise Mars?You\u0027re 47, Mr Musk was asked as part of an interview for Axios\u0027s\u0026nbspnew show on HBO. What is the likelihood you personally will go to Mars?70 per cent, he replied\u0026nbspimmediately. We\u0027ve recently made a number of breakthroughs that I\u0027m just really fired up about.He went on to explain that he was talking about moving there, and that the price for the trip might eventually be only a couple of hundred thousand dollars.Pressed on whether he was working towards building an escape hatch for rich people, he said that the journey was going to be far more difficult than staying on our own planet would be.Your\u0026nbspprobability of dying on Mars if much higher than dying on Earth, he said, comparing it with Shackleton\u0027s trip to the Antarctic.It\u0027s going to be hard, there\u0027s a good chance of\u0026nbspdeath, going in a little can through deep space, he said.\u0026nbspYou might land successfully, once you land successfully you\u0027ll be working non-stop to build the base. So not much time for leisure.And once you get there, even after doing all this, it\u0027s a very harsh environment so there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll die there. We\u0026nbspthink you can come back but we\u0027re not sure. Now does that sound like an escape hatch for rich people?Despite all that he said he would unhesitatingly go and live on the planet, once SpaceX\u0026nbspmakes it possible.There\u0027s lots of people that climb mountains., he said. People die on Mount Everest all the time. They like doing it for the challenge.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest,”\u0026nbspMr Collins told the paper.Facebook had some “very serious questions” to answer, he said, and he accused it of misleading the committee over Russian involvement in the platform.“It has not answered our questions about who knew what, with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” Mr Collins said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”Facebook said: “The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure.“We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook.“We have no further comment.”\u0026nbspThe move comes after Mark Zuckerberg said he was “unable” to testify to an international “grand committee” investigating Facebook’s role in spreading fake news.The social media company will instead send Richard Allan, its vice president of policy solutions, to answer questions at a hearing in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Try to peer back further, though, and everything changes. The visual, intellectual, spiritual, and day-to-day world of the age that came before seems maddeningly hard to grasp.Back in the 1930s, the authors of 1066 And All That captured something of the frustration: “Egg-Kings were found on the thrones of all these kingdoms, such as Eggberd, Eggbreth, Eggfroth, etc. None of them, however, succeeded in becoming memorable – except in so far as it is difficult to forget such names as Eggborth, Eggbred, Eggbeard, Eggfish, etc. Nor is it even remembered by what kind of Eggdeath they perished.”However, the low middle ages are not truly lost. Pre-conquest England is there – it is just well hidden. Occasional church towers or windows and museum cabinets of jewellery hint at a vibrant period, but it is in books and manuscripts that the Anglo-Saxons come vividly alive, delineated in everything from pale rusty ink to lush gold and lapis. In these texts we meet a vigorous and confident cast of warriors and saints, queens and kings, thegns and villagers, dragons and gods.Anglo-Saxon books are now spread all over Britain and Europe. In a moment of inspiration in 2013, the British Library decided to gather an unprecedented number of them together under one roof.Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War is now open, and its 180 exhibits froth and bubble with the whirlpool of fresh ideas and vibrant images that animated England for 700 years. With modern Britain unable to formulate a coherent 21st century identity for itself, the timing of this voyage into the past could not be more relevant.A quick reminder. Anglo-Saxon England thrived from the early AD400s to 1066. As Roman administrators and military commanders hitched their skirts, clambered onto boats, and waved “Valete!” to Britannia, boatloads of Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians eagerly arrived to fill the vacuum.\u0026nbspThe precise details of these migrations remain unclear. Some of the settlers may have been invited as mercenaries to fend off the raiding Scots (from Ireland) and Picts (from Scotland), while others almost certainly arrived to pillage and conquer. Many indigenous Britons were not thrilled. Warlords like Arthur (who may merely be an avatar for others) fought back hard. Yet despite the fierce resistance – the Historia Brittonum tells us Arthur alone slew 960 at the battle of Mount Badon – the settlers prevailed, put down roots, and built communities. Before long the newcomers from modern-day Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands had taken over, and Angle-land (England) emerged.The British Library’s timing is impeccable because the energetic imagination and international adventurousness of the Anglo-Saxons points to a profoundly dynamic period in which England buzzed at the intellectual, spiritual, artistic, and mercantile heart of Europe.9th century\u0026nbsp(British Library)Although there is little room for the Anglo-Saxons in crammed television schedules and bookshops already groaning with Plantagenets and Tudors, the Anglo-Saxons were every bit as important to the development of England. In fact, more so, as they founded it.“The Anglo-Saxon period was a formative one, both for the English and their British and European neighbours,” says Dr Levi Roach, a leading expert from the University of Exeter. “Be it in our towns and villages, our shires and counties, even our names for ourselves (‘English’, ‘Welsh’, ‘Scottish’), they have left an indelible mark.”If you look hard enough, life in modern Britain still has countless legacies of the Anglo-Saxons. Undoubtedly their most important bequest was their language: Ænglisc. (In Old English “sc” is pronounced “sh”, as in biscop or scip.) While the language has always been important in Britain and was exported to the New World and empire, its significance has grown even more in the last generation, with globalisation establishing English as the planet’s emerging lingua franca.This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one anotherEnglish may now be ubiquitous, but we rarely credit the Anglo-Saxons for its deep beauty and profound flexibility. For many – like the prime minister – “Anglo-Saxon language” is merely a periphrasis for swearing. This is a pitiful characterisation. Anglo-Saxon (these days rebranded as Old English) is the bedrock of modern English. And actually, there is no evidence any Anglo-Saxon ever uttered the F-word, the notorious monosyllable, or a wide range of other four-letter words.When we want to laud the beauties of historic English, instead of celebrating Anglo-Saxon, we usually skip straight to Shakespeare and the King James Bible. But while both have given us shimmering words and phrases, they were doing no more than wrapping ropes of fairy lights around an already solid, beautiful, old\u0026nbspand leafy tree. The fact is that long before the Globe Theatre rocked with applause, and even before Chaucer’s pilgrims met at the nearby Tabard two centuries earlier, the Anglo-Saxons were speaking and writing the earliest, luscious English.\u0026nbsp“English is a Germanic language,” explains Dr Alison Hudson, co-curator of the British Library’s exhibition. “Anglo-Saxon is the basis of some of its vocabulary and structure.” But the Anglo-Saxons were also devoted linguistic magpies, adept at incorporating new words and ideas. “One of the language’s unique marvels is its flexibility to absorb other elements, like Latin, Old Norse, and Norman French. In this period, we see loan words like ‘pepper’ and ‘cinnamon’ coming into English for the first time. It’s a wonderful reflection of the fact that the British Isles have always been a multicultural place. They even had the word ‘ylp’ for elephant. It’s one of my favourite Old English words. They had no idea what one actually looked like – they imagined it had white polka dots on pink skin – but it was an important enough part of their intellectual world to create a word for it.”Language weaves its way through the exhibition in a similar way to the bright swirls of decoration burnishing many of the old pages. At the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era we see jagged runes cut into objects from a time when daily life revolved around the old gods and goddesses. As, in a small way, ours still do. Tiw, ruler of sky and war, is still honoured by a day of the week, as is Woden, head of the gods, Thunor, the thunder god, and Frige, goddess of the home and love. Some of these inscriptions are charmingly timeless, like the discreet marketing on the reverse of a piece of delicate gold, ivory, and garnet jewellery: “Luda repaired the brooch”.Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600 (Dominic Selwood)The Anglo-Saxons did not cling to the old Germanic gods for long. In 597 St Augustine arrived to re-Christianise England, and one glass case holds an astonishing 6th century book of the four gospels, in Latin, believed to have been in his luggage.Augustine and his companions persuaded the Anglo-Saxons to adopt the religion of Rome, and the new converts became some of its most devout followers. Christianity was a book\u0026nbspand writing-based religion, and the old runes fell into disuse as Anglo-Saxon scholars adopted the Roman alphabet for Latin and Old English. For a while, though, runes clung on in places. The exhibition has a replica of the 5.5-metre high Ruthwell Cross with its spectacular carvings from the life of Christ, along with several verses incised in runes evoking lines from “The Dream of the Rood”.The oldest proper text in Old English is King Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600. It is the earliest known utterance of English law, and is the standout exhibit in the exhibition’s first room. It is an extraordinary reminder of just how old our quirky legal system is, with so much of it – including trial by jury – reaching back to principles of Anglo-Saxon justice.As you would expect, the exhibition features stellar examples of Anglo-Saxon art. The mesmerisingly vibrant decoration of the Lindisfarne Gospels (circa\u0026nbsp700) needs no introduction, but equally fascinating are the small words glossed in red ink under the main Latin text. They are in Old English, and represent the earliest known version of the gospels in the vernacular. Strange as this sounds, translating the gospels into English was not that uncommon. The Wessex Gospels – also in the exhibition – were widely copied English versions of the four gospels: something later Tudor scholars in the Protestant Reformation pretended to be undertaking for the first time.What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to usThe cases of books in the darkened series of rooms are interspersed with artefacts conjuring up the Anglo-Saxons’ physical world. The Alfred Jewel has pride of place, as do objects like the 5th century pottery Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person. There are also crowd pleasers from Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire and Binham Hoards.When Anglo-Saxon England died as a political entity at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, embroiderers depicted the run-up and battle in 58 captioned scenes on 70 metres of linen. Many of its panels show daily life either side of the Channel, preserving one of the richest records of late Anglo-Saxon society. Although the political and military narrative in the Bayeux\u0026nbspTapestry is Norman propaganda – telling their story of why William had God on his side – it is notably sympathetic to King Harold of England, and one of the reasons may be that the embroidery was perhaps made by Anglo-Saxons in Kent. Anglo-Saxon needlecraft – opus anglicanum (English work) – was world famous. The Bayeux Tapestry is not, however, in the exhibition, although President Macron has promised to send it for a visit in the near future, which will be the first time it has crossed the Channel in 900 years.The Anglo-Saxons were energetic travellers and traders, in constant contact with Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In one glass case there is an astonishing late 4th century book that made it to Anglo-Saxon England all the way from North Africa – possibly in the baggage of Hadrian, a “vir natione Afir” (man of African birth) who travelled to England in 669 and ended up as abbot of Canterbury. In another is a gold coin minted by Offa, who ruled Mercia from 757-96. Although it predictably reads “Offa Rex” on the front, it is modelled on an Islamic dinar, with Arabic writing on the back including “there is no God but Allah alone”. With travel came a thirst for knowledge, and the Anglo-Saxons were also scientists. Books in the exhibition contain diagrams of the planetary orbits and affirmations that the Earth is round.For the real soul of the Anglo-Saxons – the rhythms of their lives, loves, and deeds – there is one standout case. In it are just four books whose names will have any manuscript nerd’s pulse racing. The first is the British Library’s own Cotton Vitellius A XV. It is fire ravaged, but magically preserves the sole surviving copy of Beowulf. Alongside it lies the Vercelli Book – in Britain for the first time in 900 years – containing the only manuscript version of the mystical and haunting “Dream of the Rood”. Next to it is the Junius\u0026nbspManuscript from the Bodleian. Its poems have largely religious themes, and the page is open on “Genesis A”, which offers a good sense of their preoccupations with its nine mentions of heofan and helle. The final volume is the Exeter Book, on loan from Exeter Cathedral. It shimmers with dozens of well-known, ravishing poems, including “The Seafarer” and “The Wanderer”, and lies open on a riddle asking which creature eats words but gains no wisdom. (Spoiler: a bookmoth.) Apart from the transcendent beauty of the words and imagery in these four books, an equally extraordinary feature of them is that they contain around 75 per cent of all surviving Old English poetry.Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person, from the 5th century (Dominic Selwood)“What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to us,” explains Professor Carolyne Larrington, an expert in Old English and medieval European literature at Oxford. “This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one another.”The single manuscript copies of Beowulf and “The Dream of the Rood” witness the remarkably poor survival rate of Old English texts. This has nothing to do with either the amount the Anglo-Saxons wrote or the quality of their materials. They wrote prolifically, and their vellum and bindings were perfectly robust, as many books in the exhibition demonstrate, with thumping leather-tooled and richly gem-studded covers showing no signs of fragility.\u0026nbspThe loss of so much Anglo-Saxon writing has far more to do with the purposeful and systematic 16th century destruction of monastic and university libraries by the Tudors, whose religious policies saw bonfires and rubbish heaps made of books that referred to England’s medieval faith. Religious sculpture, too, was also decimated. The original Ruthwell Cross, with its extraordinary runic poetry inscriptions, was smashed into fragments by Protestant extremists in the 1640s, but was meticulously reassembled in the 1820s, and now stands inside Ruthwell Church in Dumfriesshire.\u0026nbspLater, a handful of notable figures tried to repair the damage and locate the books and manuscripts that had been scattered. “Despair over the fate of the contents of monastic libraries crossed confessional boundaries,” explains Professor Helen Parish, an expert in late medieval and Reformation history at the University of Reading. “The former Carmelite turned ardent evangelical, John Bale, had little sympathy with the trappings of monasticism, but still complained bitterly that the dispersal of the libraries was to the shame of the country. Matthew Parker, first archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, worked hard in the 1560s to recover lost books and records. His library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, provided the building blocks for a new history of the English church, and a burgeoning sense of national faith and identity in which the Anglo-Saxon church was the cornerstone.”\u0026nbspOne especially notable feature of the surviving corpus of Old English poetry is the prominence of women characters. Hudson explains:\u0026nbsp“There are a surprising number of Anglo-Saxon epics of strong women. Biblical characters like Judith, saints like Juliana – a Middle Eastern martyr who battled and conquered demons – and royalty like the Empress Helena. In the Genesis poem in the Junius manuscript, even Eve emerges as a notably prominent character.”Strong women are not only part of the Anglo-Saxons’ poetic world. They were part of everyday life, too. Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred and wife of Æthelred of Mercia, was named “Lady of the Mercians” and did more to bring England together as a country than possibly anyone else. Her deeds are recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sits in the same room as the four poetry books. Less regal Anglo-Saxon women’s lives are also fascinating. The exhibition has the late 10th\u0026nbspor early 11th century will of the noble widow Wynflæd, and it contains two arresting provisions. On her death she freed some of her slaves, but not Eadgifu the weaver or Æthelgifu the seamstress. And she could read, as she carefully passed on her prized collection of books.\u0026nbspIf asked to name an Old English poem, many people would nominate Beowulf. It is rightly one of the most famous stories in Anglo-Scandinavian literature, and the original manuscript does not disappoint. The poem’s 3,182 lines throb with a ripping tale of the warrior Beowulf’s mortal combat with the monster Grendel and his mother and, years later, with a dragon. The epic’s ability to transfix and delight wins new admirers every generation: most recently with Nobel prize winner Seamus Heaney’s free translation in 1999 and Hollywood warhorse Robert Zemeckis’s epic A-list motion capture blockbuster in 2007.\u0026nbspAfter Beowulf, the most famous Old English poem is “The Dream of the Rood”, in which the cross of the crucifixion tells its version of the passion story. It opens with the writer having a vision of the cross that will soon speak to him:Listen! I wish to tell of the best of dreams,\u0026nbsp(You only need to know two things to read it aloud: “æ” is pronounced “a” as in “cat” and “ð” and “þ” are both pronounced “th”.)\u0026nbspIf you read, it, two things pop out immediately. The first is that the sound and cadences are deeply rhythmical, and almost certainly mean it was recited to music. The second is that the phrases are built up with a hypnotic alliteration that is perhaps the most defining characteristic of Old English poetry.\u0026nbspIt is, obviously, more challenging than Shakespeare or Chaucer as it has many unfamiliar words and comes complete with case endings. We have managed to get rid of most of them in modern English, although a few like “them” and “whom” stubbornly remain. To add to the challenge, many Old English words have also changed their meaning over time. For instance, “spell” simply meant “story” to the Anglo-Saxons.Old English also had dialects which evolved. The main ones were based in Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, and Wessex, with Wessex eventually coming to dominate, as it was the language of King Alfred – who was a fervent promoter of literacy – and later of Ælfric, abbot of Eynsham, who wrote and standardised the language prolifically.Selwood)Despite the strange look and feel of some Old English words, there is no reason to be put off. It is not as alien as it may sometimes seem. Neither does it only live in universities, libraries, and museums. JRR Tolkien was an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon for years, and if you enjoy any of the vocabulary of Middle Earth, you are revelling in his profound skill at playing with ancient Germanic-style languages.\u0026nbspOther standout treasures in the exhibition include the pocket-sized St Cuthbert Gospel, which belonged to St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (died 687). It is the oldest European book with an original intact binding, in this instance an exquisitely decorated red goatskin cover, all miraculously preserved by having been placed into the saint’s tomb alongside him.Another is the bible known as the Codex Amiatinus. It was produced alongside the St Cuthbert Gospel at Wearmouth-Jarrow but, by contrast, is vast. With a spine over a foot thick, it takes two people to lift it and is the largest book in the exhibition. It was once one of three identical copies, but Amiatinus is the only one to survive, as soon after it was finished Abbot Ceolfrith (died 716) took it to Italy as a gift to the pope, and its homecoming to England for the exhibition is the first time it has been back in over 1,000 years.\u0026nbspIn the final room of the exhibition, beautifully lit and residing in a central case, is the most famous book ever produced in England. At Christmas 1085, William the Conqueror ordered a survey of his country, its land, and how it was occupied. Foremost in his mind was – as so often with rulers in any age – the question of property ownership and how much tax he could raise from it. Thanks to the Anglo-Saxons’ meticulous organisation of England into counties and hundreds, the research only took his commissioners until\u0026nbsp1\u0026nbspAugust the following year. When it was all written up, the result was nicknamed the Domesday Book, from the Old English “domesdei” – meaning the Day of Judgment – because the book’s record, like that of the Last Judgment, was unappealable.\u0026nbspHistory books will be harsh on us for ignoring YemenA brief history of pop-culture feudsWhy your Halloween witch’s outfit is rooted in a gendered stereotypeOn one level, the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons is something that is better appreciated outside England. We call the world’s English-speaking countries the “Anglosphere”, whereas the French choose the more nuanced “le monde Anglo-Saxon”, hinting at a distinct historic, linguistic, cultural, and philosophical heritage.\u0026nbspThe French also have no real concept of “the Dark Ages”, and the equivalent period in France has no label implying that it was unenlightened. Of course, as the exhibition demonstrates unequivocally, there never was a dark age. It is a myth dreamed up by Whig historians wanting to believe that Europe collapsed from glory into barbarity with the fall of Rome, but from the Normans onwards the British Isles marched unstoppably towards ever more profound progress and civilisation. The other reason the French have no dark ages is, of course, that they did not experience a regime as violent with history and cultural property as the Tudors.It is shameful that we so often start our islands’ history and lists of kings and queens with William the Conqueror, as if before his arrival there was a void with darkness over the deep. Britain had spectacular cultures before 1066, of which the Anglo-Saxons were one. Theirs was an intense, vibrant, literate, artistic, creative, spiritual, intellectual, practical, adventurous, outward-looking, European world. It was also a prize well worth conquering, which is why Cnut the Dane seized the throne in 1016 and William of Normandy followed him 50 years later.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The InSight lander offers the chance to have an unprecedented look inside Mars itself, finally giving us clues about what it\u0027s made up of and what\u0027s going on in its interior.New Nasa Mars lander sends back \u0027beautiful\u0027 selfie from surfaceThat, in turn, could tell us not only where it came from but might give us a new understanding of how our own planet formed.For now, InSight is charging up its batteries using the solar array that successfully unfolded after the dust had cleared from its perilous landing. Even in the first hours after its arrival, it sent back stunning photos of the Martian surface – and of itself.Now mission control will get to learning about InSight\u0027s\u0026nbsplanding site. They\u0027ll be looking for the best place to deploy, particularly searching for somewhere it can stick its deep sensor into the ground to take readings of the underneath.Once all of that is decided, engineers back at Nasa will build a reconstruction of the landing area to go alongside the already completely accurate clone of the lander itself they have down on Earth. That will allow them to practise on a precise recreation of the situation back on Mars, making sure that everything is perfectly calibrated and ready to get moving.They\u0027ll make sure the InSight lander\u0027s arm can grab the sensors and equipment and place them into the right place on Mars. As well as putting them in place, they will also have to put a shield over the seismometer that keeps it from being damaged by the extreme environment of Mars.All of that is incredibly important because the work up on Mars is so difficult: engineers liken it to playing a claw machine game except without the claw. And it is incredibly\u0026nbspdifficult, too,\u0026nbspbecause messages take so long to be relayed to the lander – in the minutes they take to get between, the thing they have asked the lander to do has already happened, so they are unable to respond quickly.That will take a matter of months. Once everything\u0027s in place, the heat probe will have to actually hammer itself deep down into the Martian surface, using special technology to dig five meters down.Altogether, that\u0027s likely take as many as five months. After that, the actual science work that InSight\u0026nbspaims to do will begin properly.That will involve taking Mars\u0027s vital signs: feeling its temperature, checking its pulse and looking at its reflexes. Taken together, that will give an insight into the way the planet is made up and offer hints at how it came to be.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It will offer an unprecedented insight into the activity beneath that dusty surface.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsEven as the craft makes its way to the ground, engineers will be using their intense practising to ensure that InSight\u0026nbsplands so that its sensors can be used. It will be directed so that even if it lands on a rock, or on its side, it will still be able to stick its sensors into the planet and examine it.Engineers will then decide where they are going to aim those sensors. They will then spend several weeks calibrating them and getting them into place, before they start taking scientific readings.Once they\u0027re in, they will start taking what Nasa refers to the as the planet\u0027s pulse. It will do so using a\u0026nbspseismometer that picks up waves as they move through the interior of the planet, helping understand how active Mars is and what makes it that way.As well as taking the pulse, it will collect other vital signs: it will measure the planet\u0027s temperature. Using a heat flow probe, it will look at how hot Mars\u0027s insides are, allowing us to understand how similar it is to Earth and help explore how both planets came to be.And it will also watch the way the planet moves, tracking its slight wobble on its axis. Using very precise radio antennas, they will watch that movement, helping understand how it is affected by the sun.So far, we have studied Mars from afar and on the ground, with telescopes, satellites and landers. By sticking sensors underneath and inside of Mars, Nasa hopes to get an insight into a planet that could one day soon become home to people.“We’ve studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbour as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The photo was taken after the solar panels successfully folded out from its sides so that its batteries can be charged, and was relayed through the Mars Odyssey orbiter that floats around the planet and sends messages back down to Earth.Tom Hoffman, InSight\u0027s project manager at Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said: The InSight team can rest a little easier tonight now that we know the spacecraft solar arrays are deployed and recharging the batteries.Nasa Mars lander successfully touches down on surface of MarsIt\u0027s been a long day for the team.But tomorrow begins an exciting new chapter for InSight: surface operations and the beginning of the instrument deployment phase.Using InSight\u0027s robotic arm, which has a camera attached, the mission team will be able to take more photographs in the coming days, Nasa has said.This will help engineers to assess where to install the spacecraft\u0027s scientific instruments, which will be able to start sending back data to Earth within two to three months.The InSight lander touched down on Mars just before 8pm GMT on Monday, surviving the so-called seven minutes of terror, a tricky landing phase for the robotic probe, travelling at 13,200mph through the planet\u0027s thin atmosphere which provides little friction to slow down.American space agency Nasa\u0027s 814 million dollar (£633 million) two-year mission aims to shine new light on how the Red Planet was formed and its deep structure, by mapping its core, crust and mantle.InSight arrived on Mars\u0027s Elysium Planitia area north of its equator, described as an ideal spot for its flat, rockless surface.It is the first attempt to reach Mars in six years.Three UK-made seismometer instruments are on board InSight, part of a £4 million UK Space Agency effort to measure seismic waves.Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Oxford who created the instruments will be based at Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California to assist with the study, including selecting the best spot for the robot arm to place the seismometer.It is wonderful news that the InSight spacecraft has landed safely on Mars, said Sue Horne, head of space exploration at the UK Space Agency.The UK scientists and engineers involved in this mission have committed several years of their lives to building the seismometer on board, and the descent is always a worrying time.We can now look forward to the deployment of the instrument and the data that will start to arrive in the new year, to improve our understanding of how the planet formed.A second instrument will burrow five metres into the ground of Mars, measuring the planet\u0027s temperature, while a third experiment will determine how Mars wobbles on its axis.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Slowed by friction, deployment of a giant parachute and retro rockets, InSight will descend 77 miles through pink Martian skies to the surface in 6 12 minutes, traveling a mere 5 mph (8 kph) by the time it lands.The stationary probe, launched in May from California, will then pause for 16 minutes for the dust to settle, literally, around its landing site, before disc-shaped solar panels are unfurled like wings to provide power to the spacecraft.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsThe mission control team at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles hopes to receive real-time confirmation of the craft\u0027s arrival from data relayed by a pair of miniature satellites that were launched along with InSight and will be flying past Mars.The JPL controllers also expect to receive a photograph of the probe\u0027s new surroundings on the flat, smooth Martian plain close to the planet\u0027s equator called the Elysium Planitia.The site is roughly 373 miles (600 km) from the 2012 landing spot of the car-sized Mars rover Curiosity, the last spacecraft sent to the Red Planet by NASA.The smaller, 880-pound (360 kg) InSight - its name is short for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - marks the 21st U.S.-launched Mars missions, dating back to the Mariner fly-bys of the 1960s. Nearly two dozen other Mars missions have been sent from other nations.InSight will spend 24 months - about one Martian year - using seismic monitoring and underground temperature readings to unlock mysteries about how Mars formed and, by extension, the origins of the Earth and other rocky planets of the inner solar system.While Earth\u0027s tectonics and other forces have erased most evidence of its early history, much of Mars - about one-third the size of Earth - is believed to have remained largely static, creating a geologic time machine for scientists.InSight\u0027s primary instrument is a French-built seismometer, designed to record the slightest vibrations from marsquakes and meteor impacts around the planet. The device, to be placed on the surface by the lander\u0027s robot arm, is so sensitive it can measure a seismic wave just one half the radius of a hydrogen atom.Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes during the mission, producing data to help them deduce the depth, density and composition of the planet\u0027s core, the rocky mantle surrounding it, and the outermost layer, the crust.The NASA Viking probes of the mid-1970s were equipped with seismometers, too, but they were bolted to the top of the landers, a design that proved largely ineffective.Apollo missions to the moon brought seismometers to the lunar surface as well. But InSight is expected to yield the first meaningful data on planetary seismic tremors beyond Earth.InSight also is fitted with a German-made drill to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground, pulling behind it a rope-like thermal probe to measure heat flowing from inside the planet.Meanwhile, a radio transmitter will send back signals tracking Mars\u0027 subtle rotational wobble to reveal the size of the planet\u0027s core and possibly whether it remains molten.NASA officials say it will take two to three months for the main instruments to be deployed and put into operation.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The speaker also confirmed the decision taken by the House was binding.”He continued: “I’m writing to seek your urgent assurance that the government will comply with the motion in full and within the next couple of days.“At this crucial stage parliament must be given the necessary information to know precisely what has been agreed to and what is being asked for a vote on.”Sir Keir’s concerns were raised after the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) – in response to a question in the Lords – appeared to confirm that the government intended to publish only a legal summary, rather than the full advice given to ministers by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox.Speaking in the upper chamber,\u0026nbspLord Keen, an MoJ spokesperson, said:\u0026nbsp”The government recognises the legitimate desire in parliament, from members on all sides and both Houses, to understand the legal implications of the final withdrawal agreement.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An RAF F-35B Lightning stealth jet (left), a United States Air Force F-15 Strike Eagle (centre) and a French Air Force Rafale fly in formation over the English Channel during Operation Point Blank.

The phenomenon, known as precession of the equinoxes, is caused by the gradual shift of Earth\u0027s rotational axis.                Earliest ever human drawings dating 73,000 years found in African cave                Historical 14th century cave and its mystical carvings at riskIts discovery was previously credited to the ancient Greeks thousands of years later.The cave artists looked to the stars to mark major events such as comet strikes, according to the researchers.Study leader Dr Martin Sweatman, from the University of Edinburgh, said: Early cave art shows that people had advanced knowledge of the night sky within the last ice age. Intellectually, they were hardly any different to us today.Teams from the universities of Edinburgh and Kent studied details of Palaeolithic and Neolithic cave art sites in Turkey, Spain, France and Germany.Animal symbol pictures daubed on the walls of the caves were aged by chemically dating the paints used.Computer software was then employed to predict the positions of stars when the paintings were made.The results showed that what looked like abstract depictions of animals could be interpreted as zodiac signs based on constellations as they appeared at the time.At every site, the cave artists practised a method of time keeping based on astronomy, the scientists claimed.This was despite the fact that the paintings were separated in time by tens of thousands of years.The world\u0027s oldest sculpture, the Lion Man of Hohlenstein-Stadel cave in Germany, an ivory carving almost 40,000 years old, was also found to support the zodiac symbol theory.Writing in Athens Journal of History, the researchers described how an ancient carved stone pillar from Gobekli Tepe in Turkey provided them with their Rosetta Stone - the key to unlocking the zodiac code.It was thought to commemorate a devastating meteor impact in North America 11,000 years ago that led to the Younger Dryas Event, a period of sudden climate cooling that triggered a mini-ice age across the northern hemisphere.The authors wrote: The date carved into the Vulture Stone is interpreted to be 10,950 BC, to within 250 years.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441924124.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"paranoid putin elite snipers assassination attempts","story":"As his military creeps towards another conflict with neighbouring Ukraine, the under-fire Russian leader knows he is now a higher profile target than ever before.Just last year a Chechen couple  - who fought for Ukraine against Russian fighters in   - were shot in an ambush after they were accused of plotting to kill Putin.The shocking case highlighted the real dangers the former KGB Lt. Colonel faces as the outspoken leader of one of the worlds most isive countries.He once became so concerned about his own safety he even asked Fidel Castro, who survived over  bids on his le, for tips on how to dodge the bullets.Putin revealed: He said to me, Do you know why Im still alive  I asked him, Why  Because I was always the one to deal with my security personally.Its clearly a message paranoid Putin took to heart as he now travels everywhere with his own elite shoot-to-kill sniper unit who fire first and ask questions later.The military-trained marksmen and women are the shadows of the Federal Protection Service , which is Putins personal bodyguard team.And the elite rle squad takes its inspiration from two WWII snipers who clocked up hundreds of enemy kills and who still have legendary status in their homeland.The crackshot snipers have one very important job which is to locate other shooters and take them out before they get the chance to pull the trigger on Putin.Although Putin refuses to elaborate on the multiple attempts of his le, here are some reported over the years:An Iraqi man was arrested after apparently plotting to assassinate Putin during a state visit to Azerbaijan in .A bomb was found hidden beneath a Russian motorway flyover Putins motorcade was due to travel on in .British cops reportedly foiled a conspiracy aimed at the assassination of Putin during one of his foreign trips in .A Chechen rebel was gunned down after a botched bomb plot to assassinate President Vladimir Putin in .The counter-snipers are armed with a state-of-the-art rle - the ORSIS T- - which has quickly become their weapon of choice.Like the US Secret Service, the FSO employs its sharpshooters or counter-snipers from its highly-trained military ranks.Russia has a proud record of integrating army snipers into its conventional forces, even though they have not always had the best equipment.But when it comes to oustanding sharp shooting they have form which dates back to the bloody days of the Second World War.Then Russia’s snipers and their M Mosin-Nagant bolt action and SVT- semi-automatic rles took a serious toll on German troops.Legendary shooter Vasily Zaytsev, immortalised in the Jude Law film Enemy At The Gates, reportedly killed more than  Germans with his crude but effective bolt-action gun.Many of Zaytsevs kills were made during the fierce urban warfare in and around Stalingrad in  and .Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the deadliest female sniper in history, killed an estimated  enemy troops with her SVT- during the same war.The T- rle is produced by ORSIS, a ision of Promtechnologies Group, which was founded in .This private arms firm is located in Moscow and builds elite firearms for the military and law enforcement.The rle can put a bullet inside a one-inch circle firing from  yards and is deadly accurate at , yards.It delivers , foot-pounds of energy and is twice as powerful as its predecessor the long-serving Dragunov.The US Army even listed the sniper file in a special report about the increasing Russian threat to the West.It described the deadly T- as one of the most capable bolt action sniper rles in the world.In , the American pro-gun lobby NRA even sent a delegation to Moscow to test-fire the gun.Its . Magnum round bullets can penetrate every known body armour currently available to troops.When Allied armies dismantled their sniper programmes after the war, the Soviets kept theirs in place and began work on a rle that would equip their sharpshooters for the post-war era.In , the semi-automatic SVD Dragunov sniper rle entered service and was put to immediate use against US troops in Vietnam.Though the Dragunov was a capable battlefield weapon, its accuracy potential and crude optics limit its effective range to around  metres.To counter the threat of a true long-range sniper attack, the FSO needed a more capable rle - enter the T- which is used today.Putin has also boosted his team of food tasters, paranoid that he will be targeted for a revenge poisoning following the Skripal attack.For several years, he has employed someone to test all his food and drink before he eats it to check it has not been tampered with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the reality is not only could it alert you to cancers that run in your family, and it can help you check up on your dads mental health.Here, Sarah Caghlan, global director of health promotions for the Movember Foundation shares the six questions to ask your dad, now...Its pretty easy to talk balls with your dad, so its a good place to start.Sarah told The Sun: Guys have always got their hands down their pants, and theyre aware of their balls from a young age, so no better place to start.But, in all seriousness, testicular cancer runs in families - so a simple chat with your dad really could be the dference between le or death.If youve got a direct genetic link with someone who has had testicular cancer, so your dad or brother, then you have an eight times greater risk of developing the disease, Sarah said.Its worth asking your dad about his granddad and uncles too - though the genetic risk does lessen the more distant the relative, she added.So, why is it important to have this chat sooner rather than later Its a young mans disease, Sarah warned.Thats why its worth a guy in his s or s, asks his dad now.Its a highly treatable disease, with great success rates so it doesnt have to be a scary one.But knowing about it is so important. If you take action early, it really doesnt have to be a scary disease.The disease is quite rare, so we arent talking big numbers, Sarah added, but for those at risk its vital to pick it up as early as possible, when it can be treated.For the last few years scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research have been investigating the genetic link.Theyve been pulling apart the gene they think is responsible, in the hope any discoveries will help in developing new treatments.Its very common for baby boys to be born with their testicles in the wrong place.About one in  boys are born with undescended testicles, and its these men who really need to have a chat with their dad .Sarah explained: There is some evidence to say men with undescended testicles at birth have an increased risk of testicular cancer.And she added, theres no need to be embarrassed.Great news! Butyoure getting ready to shave it off on Saturday, go to Movember thesun.We have a maximum of , free Gillette ProGlide Flexball Razors to give awayyou donate a minimum of £.Happy shaving!Testicular cancer wouldnt even make it on to Embarrassing Bodies, she said.If men are worried about feeling embarrassed in front of their doctors, the simple message is dont, they have seen it all - and much, much worse - before.Symptoms are dferent for dferent men, its about regularly checking your balls and getting to know whats normal for your nuts.If you feel a lump about the size of a pea, or any tenderness, any lumps and bumps that werent there before, get them checked out.If it feels sore down there and hasnt before, thats when we  ask men to take action.When it comes to mens health, prostate cancer is ones of the biggest killers.While most men are happy to chat about their balls, when it comes to the gland thats up their bottom theyre much less likely to open up.Prostate cancer is quite dferent from testicular cancer, Sarah told The Sun Online.Balls are part of a young boys le growing up.But prostate cancer is quite dferent, its still quite taboo.There are still men who havent told their familys theyve got prostate cancer until its too late.When it comes to this disease, knowledge really is power.Sarah warned men with a genetic link and family history of the disease - sotheir dad or brother has had it - are two-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed themselves.So what does it meanyour dad has had prostate cancer Sarah explainedthats the case, a man needs to have a chat with his doctor about his PSA level when hes .Andtwo members of your family have had the disease, you need to be having that conversation with your doctor from the age of .Prostate cancer is thought of as an old mans disease, Sarah said. But the reality is youre nowhere near old in your s.This just really highlights the genetic risk, and why you need to have these conversations with your dad.Though it is more of a risk, prostate cancer doesnt have to be a death sentence - but you have to act.If you find prostate cancer when its localised in the prostate you have an  per cent chance of surviving, Sarah said.If its left the prostate and is aggressive, you have less than a  per cent chance of surviving.Thats a very signicant dference.Lets get one thing clear... forget the horror stories youve heard about doctors sticking their finger up your backside!When it comes to prostate cancer chances are youll need a PSA test.And, men theand breadth of the country will give a collective sigh of relief to hear its a blood test.Were not saying every man needs to actually have a PSA test, but every man should have that conversation with their doctor, Sarah said.Its a blood test and soit comes to it, its not scary.The PSA test isnt  per cent accurate, and results could indicate an inflamed prostate rather than a cancerous one, but it is the most common way to spot the disease.It can be carried out at the GPs surgery, and measures the level of a key protein, PSA, in your blood.Raised levels could be a sign of cancer, but can indicate other issues which is why there is no national screening programme on the NHS.Sarah said one of the biggest areas of the Movember Foundations investment is into research to find more accurate testing for the disease.But, one of the most important things about a PSA test, Sarah said, is to have a chat with your dad about it.By raising the subject you can encourage him to have the chat with his doctor, and make sure it is on his radar.A lot of men will say I am only , I dont need to have it yet, she said.But the younger generation can help push change, and by asking their fathers they can make the subject far less taboo.It sounds so simple, taking the time to just ask your dad how hes doing. But it could make all the dference.This is one that really bridges mind and body, Sarah said.Men tend to deal with things in silence, toughing it out, being stoic, but its not serving them particularly well.There are a number of le events, including retirement, loss of a job, the breakdown of a marriage or relationship, which can have a profound effect on a mans mental health.They can find themselves isolated, and alone.Friendships and relationships are really important, Sarah said.It is the greatest protective factor when it comes to mental health.Women are good at growing and maintaining their friendships, but men dont put as much effort in.Thats when a son can step in and suggest their dad goes out with his mates, catches up over a round of golf or drink.The stereotype is that men dont talk, but given the right environment, they will. Its about empowering them, Sarah said.Checkyour dad has a group of friends he can rely on, maybe suggest ways for him to strengthen those friendships, or increase them.Make sure he realises how important relationships are in his le, and how important it is to make time for them.This question isnt about getting your dad down to the gym!But, it wont hurt to gently ask how much physical activity he is getting - and encourage him to be more active.It can be as simple as taking the stairs instead of the lt or walking the dog every day.Every bit of physical activity you can add into your day will help.As we get older we slow down, Sarah said.But, physical activity is so important for the mind as well as the body, it bridges both.Plus, by raising the issue of your dads exercise levels you will naturally raise awareness and help with other health issues, including heart disease and other cancers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit. It is time to stand tall in the world, not tremble at the EU’s feet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In a statement, he also praised his we Daniela Tejada.She is so brave and strong, seeing her and my family after this ordeal is the best thing that could have happened. I thank you all once again, this is very surreal, he said.He added: I don’t know where to begin with thanking people for securing my release.I have not seen or read much of what has been written over the past few days but Dani tells me the support has been incredible.Thank you so much to the British Embassy and the FCO for their efforts in ensuring I arrived safely back home.Daniela thanked the UAE for its compassion and added: We were just starting or lives, so Im thankful this opportunity has been given back to us.British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the pardon, which he called fantastic news.But officials in the UAE last night persisted in calling him an MI spy.An official told reporters in Abu Dhabi that Mr Hedges was  per cent a full-time secret service operative who was in the country to steal the UAEs sensitive security national secrets for his paymasters.United Arab Emirates authorities showed journalists the video purporting to show the Brit confessing as evidence against him.The clip, which officials did not allow journalists to record, shows Mr Hedges describing himself as a captain in MI during what appears to be a court hearing.Another clip appears to show him speaking to someone in an office and saying: It helps the research to go in in an easy way.Then Hedges is seen snapping his fingers and adds: Then it becomes MI.Hedges, a doctoral student at Durham University, was sentenced last week in a move described as deeply disappointing by PM Theresa May.He was arrested on May  after a two-week research visit to interview sources on foreign policy as part of his PhD thesis.After being taken into custody at Dubai Airport, he was moved to the UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi.He was left in solitary confinement for five months after the initial accusations.The UAEs attorney general later said Hedges was charged with spying for a foreign state, without naming it, and jeopardising the military, economic and political security of the country.His court sentencing last week lasted less than five minutes and he had no lawyer present.Today Mrs Tejada said she cannot wait to have Matt back home, while sources said he could be on a flight back as soon as today.She added: The presidential pardon for Matt is the best news we could’ve received.Thank you friends, family, media, academics, and the wider public for your unided support - I’ve been brought back to le.And Mr Hunt said on Twitter: Fantastic news about Matthew Hedges.Although we didnt agree with charges we are grateful to UAE government for resolving issue speedily.But also a bittersweet moment as we remember Nazanin  other innocent people detained in Iran.Justice wont be truly done until they too are safely home.Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s director, said: This is a huge relief and goes some way to righting a wrong after Matthew’s grossly unfair trial.Now Matthew needs to be speedily released and allowed toto the UK.Matthew should never have been jailed after such an unfair process.And he should never have been held in the miserable conditions of solitary confinement. A pardon doesn’t make up for this injustice.Emrati officials said UAE President Khala bin Zayed Al Nahyan issued the clemency for Hedges on Sunday along with with hundreds of others.UAE minister of state for foreign affairs Dr Anwar Gargash said the pardon would allow the UAE and UK toour focus to the underlying fundamental strength of the UAE-UK bilateral relationship, the WAM Emirates news agency reported.Dr Gargash said: His highness the presidents gracious clemency in the customary National Day pardons allows us toour focus to the underlying fundamental strength of the UAE-UK bilateral relationship and its importance to the international community.It was always a UAE hope that this matter would be resolved through the common channels of our longstanding partnership.This was a straightforward matter that became unnecessarily complex despite the UAEs best efforts."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000424177056.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"elon musk tesla bankruptcy promises","story":"He said the tech giant was bleeding money like crazy after he pledged to build , Model  vehicles A WEEK by the end of June this year.He revealed during the production boost he was at the factory  hours a day, seven days a week, and only sleeping for two hours.In the same interview Musk revealed there was a  per cent chance hes going to move to Mars.The tech mogul admitted its likely hell live on the red planet eventually even though theres a good chance of dying on the way.Musk, who founded PayPal and runs car firm Tesla, hopes to visit Mars using technology built by his space company SpaceX.SpaceX is currently working on a vessel named Starship, which was previously codenamed Big F***ing Rocket.Its believed that Starship will be able to make the voyage to Mars – with humans on board – within the next seven years.And Musk, speaking on HBOs Axios, said: I know exactly what to do.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The most infamous example is the Boris Johnson’s Brexit bus, claiming that leaving the EU would result in poundm a week for the NHS. Sir David Norgrove, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, rightly chastised Johnson for his “clear misuse” of figures when the former Foreign Secretary repeated this patently absurd claim last year. This evening, I will present an award at the British Curry Awards, which used to be something of a Conservative haven. Today, as with last year, Tory Brexiteers won’t be able to show their faces without facing a barrage of criticism from the restaurateurs present.  One of the other  pledges in  was made by Priti Patel, who launched a ‘Save our curry houses’ campaign. She claimed that a Leave vote would mean more chefs and staff would be able to come over from Asia because of an end to freedom of movement from the EU. This is a particularly sensitive issue for the pound.bn curry industry. Figures y, but hundreds of Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants have shut down in recent years, with forecasts that % will go by . The main problem is not demand - the Spice Business magazine estimates that Brits will eat  million poppadoms this year. It is one of supply, with % of restaurants reporting an acute shortage of chefs and kitchen staff. This was the reason I backed the idea of a ‘vindaloo visa’ at last year’s awards. This would see strict one-year visas granted to Asian chefs, who would then train the next generation of curry cooks in what is incredibly sophisticated cuisine.  Theresa May was sent this -page proposal when she was Home Secretary, but has continued to ignore its merits. Patel’s campaign helped make sure that the majority of the curry industry voted for Brexit. But the promises have proved to be . Visas will remain incredibly dficult to obtain and the industry instead faces a problem hiring the front-of-house and assistant staff that they need - because these were roles so often filled by EU workers. Restaurateurs believe they have been betrayed and senior figures from the industry have told me that the majority would now vote remain. Theresa May’s lamentable ‘deal’ has done little to assuage their anger. The curry industry, like the rest of the nation, must be given the chance to vote on that deal, with the option of an exit from Brexit, now that it is clear they were so badly misled."},{"url":null,"title":"its premeditated cruelty hardest thing","story":"NewsopinionIt’s the premeditated cruelty that is the hardest thing to swallow about Universal CreditInstitution after institution warns of he dangers of UC, but the Tories just keep rolling it outShareByBrian Reade:,  NOV Newsopinion \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the premeditated cruelty that is the hardest thing to swallow.

Theresa May is the new Kerry Katona. The most powerful person in the country, in the top job, has become the undisputed Queen of Schadenfreude. In a way, you could say that Mrs May is actually turning out to be a very inspiring leader. Every morning, however depressing and hard the day ahead of you might be, you can always make yourself feel better by reminding yourself that at least you’re not her. Her day will definitely be worse. Wherever she is, whatever she’s up to. Much, much worse. When you’re struggling to keep going, just think of her. If Theresa May can manage to even put one foot out of bed in the morning – never mind the other one, and then the rest of her – then there’s really no excuse for you not to. There’s also a good chance she’s making us nicer, as a nation, and more compassionate.  It’s a refreshing change to have a Prime Minister you feel sorry for, rather than actively despising, isn’t it  You’re not rooting for her, clearly... but you’re not quite fully rooting against her, either. She’s a Tory, – ie. inherently evil to the core with no redeeming features whatsoever – and yet rather than booing and hissing when you see her on the news, you can’t help but make the noise you wouldyou saw a puppy getting kicked. No, that’s not quite right actually... maybe more a snake getting stamped on. It’s not something you would want as a pet, but you still don’t like to see it being abused. The truth is, it is almost impossible not to desperately pity Theresa May at the moment. She worked hard to achieve an ambition, and then triumphantly succeeded, against all the odds... only for it to be an utterly miserable existence.  A poisoned chalice that doesn’t even have the decency to finish her off. The living embodiment of being careful what you wish for. Everyone hates everything she does. No-one is on her side, or in her corner. Her own party are the opposition just as much as the opposition. The criticism is relentless, and being fired from every angle. This poor, unfortunate woman, who is so into shoes, cannot put a foot right. But the most heartbreaking thing about Theresa May  She keeps going. Doggedly. She’s beaten down, broken. She’s aged over  years in the last three weeks alone, but she is determinedly keeping calm and carrying on. Her brave face never slips. She plods on regardless, grimacing as cheerfully as she can manage, teeth gritted, trying to make the best of what has turned out to be – understatement of the millennium – a bad job. There are worse role models. All this teaches us a valuable lesson. Whatever a person’s politics, or actions, may be, underneath they are still a human being, worthy of empathy, understanding and love. We need to remember that. It’s important. And then when Brexit goes through, and our country is ruined, we can get back to hating Theresa May, and her whole party again without exception, obviously. Bloody Tories – boo, hiss.

While most -year-olds know little about the complex world of politics, Tom Hulme from Oldham, Manchester, had already joined the Tory party after hearing about the referendum. Tom is such a firm supporter of the Conservatives, he even dresses like Thatcher, Prime Minister from  - . He described himself as the Iron Ladys biggest fan. Tom started dressing in womans clothes from the age of  and describes how it came naturally to him after he first tried on a dress in secret. He now spends hours applying make-up, choosing outfits and decorating his room with posters of the former PM as well as visiting people in his local constituency.  Tom, a student at the University of Lincoln, said: I have always been interested in what was going on in the world but my interest really started when I noticed the coalition was happening. Looking back, my friends were always intrigued by me and when I joined the party and started getting invites for events with the Prime Minister, they showed a lot more interest. They were always very accepting of me though. I found the party shared my views and beliefs and I wanted to be a part of that. In terms of dressing dferently, its something I had wanted to do for a long time and it just came naturally. I was dressing up in my room from the age of  and it just felt right, it was like a missing piece.  It became more public when I was around  and I just decided that everyone knew it was happening anyway, so why not  This was how I wanted to be seen. Tom, now in his second year of studying politics and sociology, comes from a humble, working-class background but says he was inspired by the former Prime Minsters upbringing, that in some ways was similar to his own. Although originally Tom never planned to look like his role model, Maggie, after comments from friends and party members comparing him to the previous leader of the Conservative party, he soon started to fashion a similar look. He said: Hearing about Maggies upbringing was so inspiring for me and the story of how she came to be. It made me believe thatshe could do it then even I can make it in the world of politics. She managed to push and shout through a world of men, its an amazing story.  People started telling me that my look was similar to hers and I thought I would embrace that. She had a great sense of style. Tom was able to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham this year, meeting MP Penny Mordaunt, the Minister for Women and Equalities, and MP Nicky Morgan but says he doesnt envy Theresa Mays position at the top. He said: The conference was so much fun and in a way a felt like the way I dressed almost gives me a sense of power, people treated me with more respect. Tom says that it was initially a shock to his parents after revealing his true identity to them but that they have now accepted him and his beliefs and are very proud of his achievements. He now has dreams of becoming a mental health nurse but says that becoming an MP would never be off the table. He said: My family are very supportive of me but it took them a while to get used to the idea.  I never wanted to push the way I am onto people, or force them to accept it. I do understand that politics is not a straightforward career butthe opportunity came up I would be happy to become an MP. I care passionately about this country and would always like to give something back.

Married couple Nevine Mann, , and Richard, , have been buying extra food and medicine every time they go shopping so they are prepared for when Britain leaves the European Union. So far they have stockpiled chickpeas, kidney beans, tuna, pasta, rice, couscous, chopped tomatoes, sterilised milk, tinned corn, beans, paracetamol and ibuprofen. The family have also bought piles of aspirin, Calpol, dried milk, honey, Marmite, porridge oats, raisins, bread, flour, yeast and coffee. In addition, the clan also boats supplies of tea, sugar, apple juice, orange juice, Ovaltine and hand soap.  They believe they have now amassed enough goods on their kitchen table to survive a no-deal Brexit - for at least four months. Their cupboards are already stocked with  tins of beans,  cans of tuna, large tubs of mayonnaise, eight cans of chopped tomatoes and four packets of passata. There are also two large tubs of milk powder, several large bags of rice, pasta, tri colour quinoa and couscous. Since the Brexit negotiations began, Nevine said they started buying more dried food and fruit as it would last longer, as well as extra pet food.  The expanded shopping list also includes seeds so she can grow her own food in her garden, and equipment to pury rainwater. The Manns also have solar  on the roof and a -gallon water tank as they fear power could also be in short supply once Britain exits the EU. Nevine said she was also stockpiling her own medication, as she takes anti-epilepsy and blood-thinning drugs. And the couple, who live in Illogan, Cornwall, with her three children Oliver, , Ethan,  and Paige, five, insisted it wasnt about luxuries - but was a matter of survival.  Nevine, a former midwe, said: A little while ago we were aware that Brexit was in the offing, and it seemed like there would be issues with securing a deal. The results of a no deal Brexit would be catastrophic in terms of getting supplies in the country, certainly in the short term. We started buying extra of things we would usually buy. When we are shopping we buy beans for now and beans for later, rice for now and rice for later. Weve got about enough for four months.  The Manns have been doing their shopping at their local Sainsburys, Tesco and Aldi stores. Nevine, who homeschools the couples children, added: There are a few things we wouldnt usually buy, like sources of vegetarian protein and powdered milk. Weve got baked beans, chickpeas, couscous, pasta - weve got things like tea, coffee, Ovaltine, things like that. We also bought marmite so we can have some flavour.. Were basically there now so we will slow down now. Were not going over the top, weve got enough to get us through the first couple of monthsthere is no deal.  Were planting seeds in the garden and weve got extra to plant in spring. No deal Brexit is looking more and more likely, were waiting to seethe new deal goes through or not. If that doesnt go through it will be no deal because there wont be enough time to sort another one out. Its not about being able to live comfortably, its about being able to survive.

And in the commotion that followed, a man allegedly snatched Chloes handbag and made off with more than pound before fraudulently accessing her bank account. Natalie, , from North Shields, said: Ive no idea who they were or anything. I think Im still in shock about what happened. Im devastated theyve taken my daughters things. I dont feel safe. Ive got tickets for George Ezra but I will not be going back again.   Daughter Chloe, , added: I dont want to go back. I dont ever want to be in that situation again. Natalie and Chloe snapped up tickets for the -year-old singers latest Tyneside visit along with their aunt Vanessa. The familys concert experience soon turned sour though due to several rowing couples stood behind. Natalie, Chloe and Vanessa tried to move away through the crowd, but say they soon found themselves subjected to an unprovoked attack.   Natalie said: We were having a really good night, Jess was really good. Then I think she just jumped on us, and I was getting dragged around by my hair. I had just been enjoying the concert but now I cant even remember what song it was. It was a shock, people around us were shouting for help. Some did help and pushed us to one side when this woman was still trying to attack us. I have no idea who they were but Id like to thank them. Chloe admits she saw red and quickly came to her mums defence. She added: I had to wrestle her off my mum. There was one lad stood there videoing it as you do apparently, and a ring formed around us. Her partner tried to stop me getting at her, and then swept everything off the floor and took all my stuff.   The couple allegedly fled the scene with Chloes belongings, and the mum and daughter were taken to a side room for treatment for the remainder of the concert. Chloe suffered black eye and swelling on her face, while Natalie left the venue with minor injuries to her scalp. The pair have spoken out in attempt to track down their attackers, but also to outline their concerns about the arenas response. Natalie claims a complaint has been lodged and that the couple should have been ejected before the attack for openly smoking in the standing area. The mother and daughter allege the arena did not report the incident to Northumbria Police and foyer staff failed to stop their attackers at the front door despite being warned. Chloe finished: It was ten minutes after we had been rolling around that they came to us. It was just shocking the way they handled it.

The little royal was part of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussexs wedding party, but the preparations were reportedly dficult for her mum. Two separate sources told theKate was feeling quite emotional at the fitting, which took place shortly after she gave birth to Prince Louis. The report comes amid rumours of a rt between the two duchesses, which has been further fueled by news Meghan and Harry will no longer be moving into an apartment next door to Kate and William.  They will move to the stunning Frogmore Cottage in Windsor instead, which will undergo a huge refurbishment before they move in. However it is not known why Kate got upset during the dress fitting, andit had anything to do with her sister-in-law. Kensington Palace declined to comment. Kate didnt have an official role in the wedding, but she was tasked with helping lead the young bridal party up the steps of St Georges Chapel and into the church.  The Duchesses have attended a number of events together, and they went to watch Serena Williams take on Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon womens final in the summer. Earlier this week the Sunday Mirror revealed there are a number of reasons why Harry and Meghan have to move to Windsor. They chose it over Apartment  - next door to William, , and Kate and their three children - because of the multi-million pound cost of the refit that would be required for the flat, which is currently occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, it is claimed.  Another reason is Harry craves more privacy and doesnt want his family to be as visible as the Cambridges, whose home and the surrounding gardens are a major tourist and paparazzi attraction. Kate and William also left London shortly after their marriage, moving to Anglesey for the Dukes job. Princess Charlotte was one of six child bridesmaids at Meghans wedding, and her big brother Prince George was a pageboy.

Meghans le changed forever the moment she showed off her huge diamond engagement ring her le, and her Royal journey officially began. The Duchess of Sussex appears to have gone from strength to strength as she learns the ropes, winning fans on both sides of the Palace gates.  The Duchess has had a lot to learn over the last  months, all while dealing with a lot of embarrassing family dramas. As well as standing proudly by Harrys side, shes also taken on her first solo project - a charity cook book to raise money for a community kitchen which supports people affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy - and given a number of moving speeches at official events. Weve spoken to some of the people who have been following her every move ever since the engagement to see what they think of Britains new Duchess. Russell Myers - Royal Correspondent, Daily Mirror It goes without question that Meghan has got off to a cracking start but undoubtedly she is still settling into her role within the royal family.Many thought that her accomplished acting background would be a great advantage and at times it most probably has.When it comes to the meet and greets, the crowds and the speeches, she’s hit the ground running.A couple of bumps in the road early on might have thrown her off course. The not wearing a hat for her first engagement with the Queen and of course the awkwardness of not knowing what side of the car to get in behind the monarch. But slowly shes started to make her mark with caused that are clearly dear to her, with the Grenfell survivors’ cookbook and speaking up for women’s rights and education on her recent tour of Australasia and the Pacic Islands.Clearly the public adore her. She has brought a new energy to the royal family. Some undeniable Hollywood glamour even.But leaks of mild tantrums and complaints from staff about how she addresses them won’t sit wellshe doesn’t adjust.She’s entered a le of duty, the one thing the British public and indeed the world over admire most about the Queen.Kate Middleton mastered this early on and throughout her time as the Duchess of Cambridge has shown herself to be a class act.Whether she’s dressed in a designer dress at a royal ball, doing charity work or playing with children in the mud at an inner city school. Meghan, at least on the outside, has shown herself to be a quick learner and I’m sure we will see the best of her next year when she is expected to announce the causes that she will focus on moving forward.One thing is for certain, with a baby and a big house move on the way, it’s going to be a bumper year for the Sussexes.Ian Vogler - Photographer, Daily Mirror Having photographed the Royals over the years , since Harry and William where children, its been a really interesting year to see Harry grow into his new role as husband and future father. Since the couples engagement a year ago its been whirlwind of events including the rather dferent royal wedding at Windsor. Meghan has certainly added some Hollywood dazzle to the Royal family, without any doubt shes doing it her way.  One of the first engagements the undertook with Prince Harry was in Brixton SW London back in January. I was struck by the warmth of the crowd towards the Duchess, she was welcomed by one of the most erse crowds I have ever seen for a Royal event. Local people I met on the day said: “She’s one of us”. On that day she went with a classic MS top, perhaps the start of her becoming a Brit  On the recent trip to Australia and New Zealand Meghan spent a lot of time engaging with young people on the subject of Mental Health. This is a cause close to Prince Harrys heart, and the couple have really worked hard in this arena. They always stay longer at events than the palace officials anticipate.  Meghan seems to have taken on the role of Duchess without the need for any rehearsals, she is very comfortable in front of the camera and a great public speaker. Her recent speech at the Invictus Games in Sydney showed that. Looking back on the year so far that Meghan has been part of the Royal Family I would say shes really moulded herself into the role of a Modern Duchess. People connect easily with her as her upbringing was a long way from a Royal one and far more like those of the people she comes into touch with .

Daniel Sidderley, , was not impressed when he found the rude items on the shelves of a branch in Stockport, Manchester, over the weekend. According to the operations manager, there were bundles of penis straws, novelty rubber breasts and willy boppers among everyday items such as birthday cards. The outraged uncle even claims that he saw some parents shielding their childrens eyes as they walked past. Daniel told Manchester Evening News: I was disturbed by what was on display. I would describe some of it as pornographic material and it was all accessible for children to see.  It was mostly stag and hen party paraphernalia. There were erect penis straws, blow up sheep and headbands with penises on springs. It was the kind of thing youd expect to see on a specialist eBay site or relegated to a seedy back street shop. I just couldnt believe it was displayed among all the other stock and not more hidden at the back or somewhere high up. Some unsupervised children were looking at it while other parents were shielding their kids eyes as they walked past. Daniel, who was shopping with his young niece and nephew, said he complained to a member of staff while he was in the store but was told it was the managers day off.  The supervisor gave me an old receipt for a ham sandwich with the web address circled with blue ink, added Daniel. I was told: If you have a complaint you can contact customer services. You’ll find the contact details on the website. Daniel did receive a response to his complaint from the customer relations team at Poundland on Monday.  A spokesperson for Poundland said: While we know some of the items in our stag and hen party range won’t be to everyone’s taste, they sell extremely well and the majority of customers appreciate the tongue-in-cheek humour.

The Royal Family are known to adhere to the German tradition when it comes to festivities, according to royal chef, Darren McGrady.

Dash cam footage showed Joshua Gardner, then , brandish the enormous blade on a south London street before launching the furious attack. In clips shown to a jury, he can be seen repeatedly hitting the windows and doors as he threatened the driver, aged , who managed to escape. But now an Old Bailey judge told Gardner, now , he avoided jail because he carried the kne following a ten-day kidnap ordeal in which he was held at gunpoint. Gardner, from Thornton Heath, south London, was found guilty of attempted GBH and also admitted affray and having an offensive weapon on London Road, Croydon, on May . Judge Anuja Dhir QC said: There was an incident of kidnapping between about March  and April , so a relatively short period of time before you committed this offence. You were bundled into a car, and threatened with a gun because of a drug debt that a friend of yours had run up.  You were then taken to a place referred to as a trap house for ten days and you were made to sell drugs to work off the debt. The kidnapping, said to be by a gang of men in their s, reduced your culpability, she told Gardner. But she branded the attack menacing and said he would otherwise have faced jail. She said: The offending related to a violent incident that took place on London Road in Croydon. From start to finish it lasted  seconds and nobody was injured. Nonetheless, it was a frightening incident. You attacked a car in a threatening and menacing way. The incident was caught on camera and the footage was played to the jury. It showed the extent of the violence you used. Judge Dhir said only the police officer in the case gave evidence during the trial but it was clear Gardner knew the victim. She added: You were seen to attack the car with your feet, your fists and with a zombie kne that you produced from your waistband.  Gardner was in breach of a youth rehabilitation order for an attempted robbery at the time of the attack, she said. Judge Dhir said: The facts of that offence are that you approached a schoolboy, you demanded his phone and money and you had with you at the time a pocket kne. She said his response to rehabilitation after the attempted robbery in  was another reason he avoided jail. The judge said: Carrying a kne of that kind in a public place, concealed in your waistband as it was, is a very serious matter. He was given two years for the attempted GBH, one year for the affray and one year for possession of the kne, to run concurrently. The sentence was suspended for two years and he was also told to carry out a rehabilitation order and  hours of unpaid work.  Gardner will also be subject to an overnight -hour curfew between am and pm for nine months. Detective Constable Aaron Champion said: The footage that was circulated widely in the media, which showed Gardner waving around a zombie style kne understandably shocked both the communities of Croydon and the wider public. He had decided that day for whatever reason that he would attack this man and brazenly pulled out this kne in front of horried members of the public, some of whom had finished work or had collected their children from school. His conviction and sentence send out the message that the police will not tolerate the mind-set Gardner seems to have adopted - that the casual use of a kne is justied to settle even minor dferences.

Gunner and his friend, Jake Morales, also , were found unresponsive on November  in Prescott Valley, Arizona, by Gunners mum. Aunt Brandi Bundrick Nishnick shared the story of her nephews unexpected and shocking death on Facebook - in the hope that it could save other peoples lives. She wrote: Gunner went out with friends on Friday night. They came back to my brothers house late and stayed up eating pizza and playing video games — like most  year old boys do.  At some point during the evening, Gunner, and his friend, took a pill stamped Percocet. The very popular and easily accessible pain killer. Both teens were found unresponsive the next morning. A medical examiner later ruled that the teens had died due to a lethal combination of illicit drugs, fentanyl and -ANPP, according to The Daily Courier. “Both went to sleep and never woke up, Brandi continued. My sister in law, his mother, found both boys the next morning. She, and my nieces, tried to resuscitate to no avail. Both boys had been dead for hours and there was nothing they, or the paramedics, could do.” According to Nishnick, Gunner had no history of drug use nor was ever a problem child and was extremely loved in his community.  The aunt said that the family dont know why he decided to take a pill that night, but assumed he wanted to experiment. Gunner had a whole le ahead of him. He had goals and aspirations. He wanted to be a dad… One bad choice, one stupid minor mistake was all it took, she wrote. The devastated aunt warned that there can be no experimenting as messing with drugs is a matter of le and death. She hopes that by sharing her story with other parents, it could save your childs le. The post has since gone viral. Its been shared almost a million times and received , comments from people sending their love to Brandi.

Wattss we Shanann was discovered in a foetal position in a shallow grave after being murdered by her husband in Colorado, US. The -year-old, who had been  weeks pregnant with a son, had her knees pulled up to her chest and her feet positioned up. Her face was facing down into the ground, while her back was positioned upwards, according to the reports, released last week. Her left arm, meanwhile, was extended near her head.  Shanann, a loving mum, was located around nine inches below the surface grade at an Anadarko Petroleum site where Watts worked. The bodies of the couples daughters, Bella, four, and three-year-old Celeste, were discovered at the bottom of oil tanks at the site. They were found after workers began the process of unloading and emptying the contents of the tanks during the investigation. A crime scene report - among nearly , pages of records released on the case - details the moments the youngsters were located. Upon the completion of emptying the east tank, a juvenile female victim believed to be Celeste Watts, was found buried in crude oil sludge at the bottom of the east tank, it states.  She was wearing clothing and a nappy, but no shoes or socks. After the recovery of the victim from the east tank, the west tank was drained under the same procedural guidelines, the report states. Again, found in the bottom of the tank, in the crude oil sludge was the second juvenile female victim believed to be Bella Watts. The little girl was also without any shoes or socks. Another report documents the autopsies of the mum and daughters, which took place at a Colorado medical centre on August . According to the report by a crime scene analyst, all of the victims bodies were in an advanced state of decomposition.  Shanann was dressed in a T-shirt, bra and panties. Devastatingly, the remains of a foetus were visible. At the time of her murder, she had been pregnant with a son she was going to name Nico. The report says Bella was wearing a onesie and underwear - while her younger sister was dressed in a nappy, underwear and a T-shirt. The two reports - and the other hundreds of pages of documents - were released by the Weld County District Attorneys Office. The chilling last photos of Shanann, Bella and Celeste, taken just hours before they were murdered, were included in the release.  The documents became public after Watts admitted to murdering the trio, who had been reported missing from their Frederick home. The killings took place on either August  or . On November , Watts - who also admitted unlawfully terminating a pregnancy - was locked up for le without the possibility of parole in a plea deal that saw him avoid a possible death sentence. The father, , had made a tearful TV plea to find his we and daughters after they vanished three months ago. Days later, on August , he was arrested but denied he had killed them.  However, he began repeatedly changing his story to police. He claimed that his we had strangled their daughters in revenge after he revealed he was having an affair and wanted to split. He allegedly told detectives that he flew into a rage and strangled Shanann after catching her in the act on a baby monitor screen. But police rejected Wattss story and charged him with murder. Shanann and her daughters were laid to rest on September .

They made the find as they prepared to stay the night in a remote hunt and heard a deafening crash through the pine trees. Next morning they went to investigate. “We saw lying here such an alien device,” said one on a video recording the rocket. Then they saw a RKTS Progress sign on the rocket confirming it was Russian and used for a Soyuz launch. The hunters gave their verdict on the find in the remote tundra - “what a case!” and “damned amazing”.  “You go hunting and it can fall right on top of you,” said one. The spaceship had “broken all the pines while falling” several hundred feet from them. The video is believed to be from the Komi republic in the far north of Russia, although the hunters have not identied themselves. It is estimated the rocket fell around ft from a road. The discovery is believed to have been in September but the video only emerged recently.  The men became concerned as they inspected the wreckage which its believed to have been on a flightpath from a launch from Plesetsk cosmodrome. One of the hunters said: Look here are kind of oxygen cylinders... The other warned him: Don’t touch, it can be radioactive.  The Komi republic has collectors of rocket debris and the hunters said that “the scrap gathers will be here soon”. Homeowners in the far-flung region have made collections of old rocket parts. A picture shows how metal launch debris is used as a garden water tank. Inventive Russians have also made boats from wrecked rockets.

Trewallter Fawr in south Wales was used as the set for the Sherlocks parents home in the BBCs BAFTA-winning show starring Benedict Cumberbatch. The detective and his sidekick John Watson, played by Martin Freeman, have visited the home on several occasions and the memorable scene where theyre picked up by a helicopter was based there. The current owner says: That was quite a surprise. And now the stunning six-bedroom property has gone on the market, and its just as incredible as you would expect inside.   The Grade II listed building is set in one and a half acres of land, and boasts three reception rooms, a barn, stables and several outbuildings. Unsurprisingly the home, which is being sold by Chewton Rose, doesnt come cheap and it has a price tag of pound,.    Belinda Bishop, Chewton Rose branch partner, said: For almost  years, Trewallter Fawr has been a magnicent family home and the current owners have relished its exquisite features and countryside setting. It was Sherlock Holmes parents house in the BBC drama series. There was a scene where Sherlock was picked up by helicopter and they used CGI to make it look like the helicopter landed on the front lawn.   It is thought that parts date back to the late Elizabethan or early Stuart periods, but it is likely a home stood on the site even earlier. The property retains many original features, including an inglenook fireplace, with accompanying beehive bread oven, flagstone floors and historically signicant thumb markings on an original ceiling plaster.

Oksana Voevodina, is now the first lady of Malaysia following her wedding to monarch Muhammad V of Kelantan. The beauty queen rose to fame when she was crowned Miss Moscow in  at the age of . Now , she married the king in a royal wedding ceremony in Moscow after reportedly converting to Islam earlier this year. Oksana - who has worked as a model in China and Thailand, and has posed in revealing pictures - is  years younger than the king.  He is known as Yang di-Pertuan Agong and is referred to as ‘Your Majesty’. The groom’s full name is Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra ibni Tengku Ismail Petra. The ceremony took place on November  in a concert hall in the upscale Moscow suburb of Barvikha, reports Islam News. Before becoming a royal bride she said: “When I was at school I was a kind of bandit. “I liked some skaters, bikes, VMX, guys who took part in competitions. I love riding a bike too.”  She said: “I think that the man must be the head of the family and of course shall not earn less than a woman.” The wedding was alcohol-free and all food was halal. The -year-old king was dressed in Malaysian national clothes, and the bride wore a glittering white wedding gown. She took the Muslim name Rihana and a picture of her in a hijab was posted on Twitter. One message read: The people are grateful and proud to receive Queen Agong. Long live the king!” Malaysian news portal rakyatku said that the former beauty queen converted to Islam on  April .  Little is known about Oksana apart from her victory in the Miss Moscow contest three years ago. She is believed to be a graduate from the Faculty of Business at the elite Plekhanov Russian University of Economics. It is unclearshe has been married before since she has used the surname Voevodina during her glamour career - but has reverted to her father’s surname Gorbatenko. Reports in Kuala Lumpar say she will be known in future as Rihana Oxana Gorbatenko. Her father Andrey Gorbatenko is an orthopaedic surgeon from Rostov-on-Don believed to be in his late s. He is seen hugging her in a picture taken on a boat near the Kremlin as she wears her beauty crown after her beauty pageant victory.  She said at the time that he helped her overcome her nerves in the final. “When I was performing [at the contest] there was my father sitting in the hall and he was like a reference point for me,” she said. “I was watching only him and performing only for him. “Because I knewI do something wrong, papa is papa, he would never say anything and he would not ever condemn. “He would just smile and say: ‘Its OK, just get up and go on. “So I felt strong support from his side.”  Oksana claims she only realised the power of her looks when she went to university. “I was the tallest in my classand the most slim, and I was a bit worried about that,” she said. “Only when I was at university, did I realise that this was my strong side. “Young guys started to pay attention and I realised that they looked at me more often than at fat and not very tall girls.” At the time she won Miss Moscow, she insisted she did not have a boyfriend because she hadnt found rather right man. I do not have a boyfriend, she said.  And I think that it would be harder for me to win,I had. Because every boyfriend,he let his girl go to the beauty contest, she wont be his girlfriend anymore. Because she will get lots of attention, secondly she doesnt have any time for a private le and finally I think it will be a distraction. I will have the relations when my heart will tell. So far it is silent. After winning her Miss Moscow title she said: “My hobby is the design of female clothes and swim suits. I sew womens clothes by order, too.” Her mother was a beauty contestant in a local contest in Penza in the early s soon after the collapse of the USSR. The Malaysian ruler - an elected monarch who has been on the throne since  succeeding his father - has not disclosed how the couple met.  The Malaysian head of state was educated at Oakham School in Rutland, England and St Cross College, Oxford University. Later he attended the European Business School in London. His heir is currently his younger brother Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there. He has that athleticism you need to play full-back, wing-back as well but I think you can get goals out of him.“He’s versatile but I think sometimes with players you need to nail down a position so we’re trying to do that with Jesse.“But I definitely see him in the midfield area.”Curran is expected to continue in that right-wing role for the Dark Blues at Hibs on Saturday despite having fit-again Roarie Deacon as competition.The former Sutton United man missed the draw with St Mirren with a thigh strain but trained this week and is available.Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp sven-goran-eriksson-wants-dundee-youngster-jesse-curran embed # secretxcPQdfeTm\" data-secret\"xcPQdfeTm\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5be952ec5ceeb.jpg ","title":"several dundee car parks to offer all day 1 parking on sundays","story":"Several Dundee car parks are offering all-day parking on Sundays for £.The Overgate Shopping Centre says the new price for its car parks will be in place permanently from this Sunday.Overgate, Dundee has announced it will now offer £ all day parking every Sunday with immediate effect.The decision has been taken following a successful autumn promotion which launched on Sunday September .The shopping centre has reported a year-on-year footfall increase of % since its introduction.The company said in a statement: #Overgate has two safe and secure multi-storey car parks and , spaces a -space car park located on Bank Street and a -space car park located on West Marketgait .#Both car parks are attached to the centre via indoor access routes, clean and well-lit with regular security patrols and have -hour CCTV monitoring.

meningitis.“We had rounds of tests over the first few days and then on day eight the consultant sat down with us and said Rory had catastrophic brain damage.”Husband Euan, , added: “First they told us there would be some issue with his motor skills and he just got worse and worse and worse. They sum up his condition with cerebral palsy, but it’s more than that.”Joanne and Euan were later put in contact with Tracy Johnstone, founder and chairwoman of Charlie House, a charity which supports children with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions.The charity has now launched its Big Build Appeal to raise £ million to create a specialist support centre for children and their families in the north-east.Joanne said: “As soon as I met Tracy, she started talking about the other families that she knows, how much research she’d done to make Charlie House a reality, because there was so little.“The respite centre is a huge, big deal for us, but the network is so important and suddenly we’d met all these families who were in the same position as us.“It was so nice to feel like we weren’t the only people in the world.“You know you’re not the only people in the world, but it feels like that.”Charlie House launches £ million appeal to build specialist care centre for north-east children\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local charlie-house-launches--million-appeal-to-build-specialist-care-centre-for-north-east-children embed # secretpfeWZlrLd\" data-secret\"pfeWZlrLd\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Charlie House launches £ million appeal to build specialist care centre for north-east children# # Evening Express\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Joanne added: “We’ve met so many families through Charlie House that we realise it’s such a huge scale.“We had no idea before Rory was born that there was anything wrong and people say how unlucky we were but we’ve never known anyone with disabilities, so to suddenly be faced with being parents of a child with disabilities was dficult.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

Plans include bungalows and two-storey homes with detached, semi-detached or terrace options. Councillors approved planning in principle at the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel on Thursday. Traffic would access Manse Road to get to the new development, the meeting heard. And the bus stop on the main street would be upgraded to show bus arrival times,the homes get the final go-ahead. Objections have been voiced about drainage concerns, flooding, parking, traffic and wildle. But no objectors spoke out against the building bid at the meeting but their concerns have been posted online. Sheila Penny raised concerns about traffic and the Coylton Primary School roll on behalf of the Kyle and Carrick Civic Society. Her objection online said: “There is likely to be considerable traffic congestion with an additional  plus houses in the vicinity. Joining the A at peak times presents dficulties to existing residents.” She added: “Finally the infrastructure locally has to be considered including the increase to the school roll at Coylton Primary.” Annette Mingay, of Manse Road, is worried about the impact on wildle and traffic. She said an increase in vehicles could “endanger le.” She said: “The Hillhead area of the A is a dangerous road during peak times, and I have often had to wait a considerable time to get across on foot when there is a lot of traffic during the day.” Mrs Mingay pointed out she has spotted a Barn owl in Coylton. She said: “If this application is granted, we will lose most of the wildle that is attracted to this area.” "},{"url":null,"title":"black-friday-2018-our-pick-of-the-top-mobile-phone-deals","story":"This Black Friday is shaping up to be another cracking day of deals, with offers on everything from a shiny new pair of shoes to a brand-spanking-new K TV.Black Friday is a great time to save on phones too whether youre looking to pick up a new handset for less or its about time you got yourself a competitive contract, youll find plenty of deals offering hefty discounts.To help you get the very most out of your savings this Black Friday, weve put together this handy page packed full of tips, tricks, advice and even links to deals to get you off to a running start.So, lets get to it!*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came

are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

In his BBC interview Raab pointedly refused to endorse Theresa Mays mantra ldquono deal is better than a bad deal. And the Prime Minister is not saying that any more either. If no deal is out and the PMs Withdrawal Agreement is toast, it means Brexit is now seriously stalled. This opens the way for the entire process to be halted,an when parliament rejects the May deal emphatically and finally, as it must next month.Yet at the beginning of the week, it rather looked asTheresa May was going to succeed in delivering her Chequers-derived exit deal. So what happened  Two events led up to this important juncture: the failed ldquoDads Army coup and the publication of the Political Declaration.The vainglorious attempt by the European Research Group of hard Brexit Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees Mogg, to organise a coup against the Prime Minister was a dismal failure. They failed to gather enough votes even for a leadership contest to be triggered. It exposed the entire hard Brexit faction of the Conservative Party to ridicule and underlined their own irrelevance. Strike one to Theresa May.Suddenly, the press started to feature more positive images of the PM: no longer the hapless, bumbling dancing queen but a serious politician doing her best, a stateswoman even. One Tory backbench supporter said her opponents were motivated by ldquomisogyny and many women appeared to agree. A YouGov Times polls showed that the PMs approval rating had risen  points in one week.But then came what was probably the crunch moment in the entire two and a half years of Brexit negotiations: the publication of the  page Political Declaration. This was supposed to outline Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU after Brexit. It didnrsquot. The painful reality is that nothing has been agreed.To say that the document is woolly is an insult to sheep. It is a disingenuous confection of warm words, empty declarations and wishful thinking that no one could possibly take seriously. The only thing it really delivered was a surfeit of adjectives - ldquoambitious, broad, deep and flexible - without the slightest hint of how Mrs Mays ldquofrictionless trade deal could ever be achieved. It amounted, as the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon observed, to the release of a herd of unicorns.Theresa May insists that the PD outlines ldquoa unique trading relationship with the EU, but it does nothing of the kind. It promises: ldquoa free trade area as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both Parties. But the reality is that the mutual interests of the parties, the UK and the EU, are irreconcilably opposed, not least because of the PMrsquos red lines on immigration and the single market. At bottom, the Political Declaration only guarantees a Canada-style free trade agreement.The document makes clear that the EU will regard the UK as a ldquothird country, and that further participation by the UK in the single market involves: ldquorespecting the integrity of the Unionrsquos Single Market and the Customs Union and the inisibility of the four freedoms. If Britain accepts the common rules or ldquolevel playing field on trade and services, it has also to accept ldquothe integrity of the Unionrsquos legal order... including the role of the Court of Justice of the European Unionin the interpretation of Union law.This has been compared to the kind of control the old Soviet Union exercised over nominally autonomous republics like the Ukraine. Thats unfair: the EU is not a communist dictatorship. But it does look very like the current EU arrangement with Turkey, which is in the Customs Union for goods but not in the EU. This is because of Britains commitment to the Northern Irish backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which accompanies the Political Declaration.The backstop began le as an attempt to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but has ended up placing the UK in an intolerable position for a sovereign nation: having to accept laws over which it has no control. Dominic Raab is absolutely right. This is far worse than remaining in the European Union. Right now, the UK is fully represented, not just in the EU parliament and the Brussels commission, but as a member of the Council of Ministers, is part of the supreme decision-making body of the Union. This gives the UK an effective veto matters of vital national interest.Britain loses this power next March, when we leave the EU. Thereafter we will still have to accept EU laws during the transition period and throughout the backstop arrangement, which will continue unless and until there is a new frictionless trade deal negotiated. The Political Declaration made clear that there isnt the remotest sign of such a deal happening.In the backstop, Theresa May has agreed for the UK to remain in the Customs Unionand for Northern Ireland to remain largely in the single market. Worse still, Britain can only leave the backstop by mutual agreement with the EU, which gives Brussels an effective veto on Britainrsquos departure from it. As Dr Kirsty Hughes has pointed out, the transition backstop places the UK in the same subordinate position as Turkey, a country which is trying to enter the EU but has not met the relevant conditions. Britain will have a legal obligation to follow trading rules on which it has no say.Does Theresa May understand how the EU s  She says that Britain is restoring its ldquosovereignty in the Withdrawal Agreement. Yet the truth is, the UK never lost its sovereignty in the  years it was in the EU. This was stated clearly in paragraph . of the UK governments own White Paper in February . However, under the Withdrawal Agreement Britain really does stand to lose sovereignty, and become a country whose laws governing trade are set by a foreign entity.That  page document was a tightly-drafted legal text, written in a language accessible only to lawyers. Now the Political Declaration has, by its very vagueness, exposed Britains dilemma with crystal clarity: we are in danger of making a mistake of historic proportions. It is simply impossible to contemplate Britain agreeing to this, and no responsible national legislature should accept it. No longer is British sovereignty ldquopooled in the EU, it is effectively relinquished.I dont blame Brussels for this. They wish Britain well, but their priority has always been to protect the integrity of the European Single Market while avoiding a hard border in Ireland. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, simply stuck to his brief. Theresa May tied herself in linguistic contortions, trying to gain privileged access to the EU without being a member of it. That was never going to happen. Like M.C. Escherrsquos impossible staircase, the negotiations always ended up at the beginning.MPs must now help Dominic Raab to draw the obvious conclusion, revoke Article  and halt the process. Dead. Say no to no say."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9097246.jpg?type=article-full","title":"theresa-mays-brexit-deal-leaves-britain-with-worst-of-all-worlds","story":"The Labour leader, responding to the Prime Ministers statement to MPs, said: \"The botched deal is a bad deal for this country, and all yesterday did was mark the end of this Governments failed and miserable negotiations.\"There can be no doubt that this deal would leave us with the worst of all worlds: no say over future rules and no certainty for the future.\"Read more:Theresa May warns Emmanuel Macron not to use backstop threat to gain UK access rights for EU fishermenMr Corbyn told the Commons: \"The Prime Minister may want to try and sell yesterdays summit as a great success, but to borrow a phrase, the reality is nothing has changed.\"The Prime Minister sayswe reject this deal it will take us back to square one.

It says this may be a primary factor in the attainment gap.It points out that in a survey carried out by the Child Poverty Action Group in Glasgow, one in  families said they had been forced to turn to foodbanks in order to feed their children during the school holidays. The report concludes that a direct cash payment would provide the most \"dignied\" way to ease the financial pressure on such families.The Scottish Government has the power to set up new benefits, but the report also calls on councils and charities to work with central government to set up universal holiday clubs, to help provide opportunities for children and help families manage the cost of childcare. It says school meals are withdrawn during holidays, just when families face other pressures such as increased childcare costs, and the loss of other key supports including breakfast clubs, after school activities and pastoral support in school.And it says a school holidays tsar should be appointed to ensure a more consistent approach cross Scotland.Douglas Hamilton, Poverty and Inequality Commission chair, said: \"School holidays make up a quarter of the year, so it is no surprise that they can create signicant pressures for Scotlands poorest families around finances, food, opportunities for play, social isolation and parenting.Read More: Council plans free school meals all year long\"The holidays bring additional costs and challenges to already hard-pressed families, particularly over the six-week summer break and at Christmas.\"Free school meals are seen as a vital benefit for the rest of the year but are, in effect, withdrawn during school holidays at a time when families face the most financial pressures.\"The Commission believes that money is the most dignied way to respond to food insecurity, offering families choice in how to meet their needs.\"Thats why our report recommends that the Scottish Government introduce an additional cash benefit during school holiday periods in recognition of the additional costs that families face.\"Councillor Stephen McCabe, Cosla Children and Young People spokesman, welcomed the report and said in general terms local authorities work closely with their partners to address child poverty.He said: \"We know from our own data that the vast majority of local authorities provide some form of out of school hours provision for children and young people experiencing poverty.\"Whilst food is a part of this it is also focused on activities and parental support and involvement. This is work that is funded largely by local authorities themselves at a time where there are signicant budget pressures on essential services.\"We are in discussions with the Scottish Government on how we can work in partnership to support those on the lowest incomes in the holiday periods and at other times outside of school hours.\"A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe thank the Commission for its detailed report and will give careful consideration to its findings.ldquoUK Government welfare cuts are having an adverse impact on many families and we are investing over pound million this year to mitigate against these impacts and protect those on low incomes.ldquoOur Fair Food Fund also promotes dignied solutions to food insecurity, and we have already committed to increasing this to pound. million next year - pound million of which will be focused on the school holidays.

And the internet is now well and truly bad. Of course, no technology is bad in and of itself, it can only assume a moral dimension thanks to the purpose humanity puts it to ndash but we humans have definitely pointed the web down a dark and nasty path.New research shows that  per cent of Britons believe at least one conspiracy theory. People who voted Brexit are more likely to believe a conspiracy theory, but Remainers are far from immune ndash  per cent of Leave voters believed at least one outlandish tinfoil-hatted scare story, compared to  per cent of pro-EU voters. Some  per cent of Leavers believed Muslim migration was part of a plot to create an Islamic majority in the UK ndash six per cent of Remainers believed the same nonsense.I donrsquot raise this issue to make a political point ndash I raise it to make a social point, for these conspiracy theories are bred online. The research was conducted over six years and in nine countries by academics at Cambridge University and pollsters at YouGov. One of the lead researchers, John Naughton, found that conspiracy theorists were early adopters of the internet as they realised it could help peddle their madness where the mainstream media ndash with its experts, facts, and statistics ndash would not. Professor Naughton calls the top tier of conspiracy theorists ndash the likes of David Icke with his lizards, and Alex Jones with his InfoWars ndash ldquoconspiracy entrepreneurs, as they make a hell of a lot of money out of propagating claims that a monkey in a tree would have trouble believing.The internet allows lies to prosper ndashwhether itrsquos claims that Jews run the world, or the Democratic Party is a paedophile ring, or Muslims are taking over Europe ndash and these lies play into our politics, infect and inform it, distort it.If you focus on this latest research you get the shuddering sense that the net has curdled our minds, but look beyond that research and yoursquoll see that itrsquos set rot in everywhere.Some years back, I made a documentary about extreme pornography ndash one of the things that shocked me while researching the film was the rise of impotence among young men. These young men had been raised on a diet of online pornography so out there that when it came to sex with ordinary young women they couldnrsquot perform. Now, I am no prude and I see pornography as just another part of our adult world, but when sexuality is expressed in a form primarily of degradation, violence and complete objectication no good can really come to the human spirit.Letrsquos move away from the bedroom to the outside world ndash it has been corroded by the internet as surely as acid melts plastic. Look at your high street, itrsquos either dead or dying. Itrsquos a smear of betting shops and charity shops. Your local bookshop has gone, the local clothes store has gone, the list goes on. That is not a result of giant supermarkets ndash they did for your butcher and baker ndash itrsquos a result of you shopping online. You sailed up the Amazon and killed off your local entrepreneurs.Even the seemingly positive side of the internet has negatively changed society ndash think of the benefits of email, then think of all the posties it put out of work. Wikipedia murdered the encyclopaedia. Every time you buy a property online, thatrsquos an estate agent job as risk ndash and evenyou donrsquot like estate agents you surely donrsquot wish them unemployed. Buying insurance online  Goodbye independent insurance broker. Taking a trip via Trivago  Farewell local travel agent.The internet isnrsquot just changing us and the world for the worse, it is narrowing choice while ly being seen as an instrument of widening choice. Most people just shop with the internet giants ndash thatrsquos not choice, thatrsquos domination.And so what do we do  We canrsquot just sit and cry boo-hoo itrsquos all so dficult. We canrsquot just shrug our shoulders and say well thatrsquos the world, buster, like it or lump it. And we canrsquot label criticism of new technology as some anti-progress, reactionary scaremongering.Not all progress is good progress ndash the arms industry has taught us that from gunpowder to white phosphorous. And all progress carries with it some casualties ndash only a fool would think otherwise. The printing press certainly left a few illustrating monks without a shilling, but the benefits outweighed the cost. With the internet the cost seems never-ending, the damage is relentless.How we think, how we have sex, our jobs, the shape of our cities, our politics ndash it is all slowly eroding away. This is not like the change from vinyl to CD, this is an unregulated social, political, economic and cultural maelstrom.And we might have just hit on the key word there ndash unregulated. What is it with internet exceptionalism  Just a few days ago Mark Zuckerberg was talking on CNN about giving ldquospecial deference to certain types of news content on Facebook. To me, that sounds very much like being a newspaper editor or the editor of a TV current affairs programme. If Facebook is acting like the BBC then regulate it like the BBC.We all know the old aphorism that when it comes to freedom of speech you canrsquot run into a crowded theatre and shout ldquofire. The online world is a pretty crowded space too, and getting back to our starting point of the web and its propagation of conspiracy theories, I donrsquot think you should be able to shout ldquothe Jews run the world while protected by the nameless and faceless anonymity of entities like Twitter. Want to say something  Then show your face and give us your name.Technology has no morality without humans. Wersquove had more than  years now of seeing what wersquove done with the internet, and morally itrsquos not pleasant. We need to throw a lasso around it and bring it to heel.

Having grown up in the north-east of Scotland and witnessed the decline of once-thriving fishing towns like Fraserburgh and Peterhead, it was easy to understand why. Designed to safeguard the sustainability of the seas, the CFP necessarily restricted the size of the catch local vessels could bring in, with the number of fishermen working on Scottish boats halving between the s and the late s as a result. The north-east, which accounts for around a quarter of the total Scottish workforce, bore the brunt of that decline, with Fraserburgh seeing numbers fall by  per cent while in Peterhead they dropped by  per cent.The damage this has wreaked on the local economy has been immense, with high streets that in the s were filled with bustling shops and chintzy cafes all but dead while the windows of countless private residences, once resplendent with Royal Doulton figurines, have been boarded up. With heroin addiction continuing to claim the lives of too many youngsters who at one time would have been destined for a le at sea, wouldnrsquot you too have voted to break away from the remote political institution whose desk-bound bureaucrats had caused all those ills The problem is that holding the EU ndashand the CFP in particular ndash responsible for all the problems that have befallen such communities ignores the influence of way too many other factors. Such as the fact that the licences required to operate within the rules of the CFP have been allocated by the UK and Scottish governments in such a way that large super-trawlers have been able to flourish at the expense of the smaller-scale fishermen who were once the mainstay of the fishing industry. Indeed, while there are more than , vessels licensed to fish in Scotland, in  two-thirds of the catch by weight was landed by just  super-trawlers.Or the fact that the heroin epidemic that has rendered so many in the north-east incapable of following their forbears out to sea sprang up due to an abundance, rather than lack of, wealth. Though fishermen had long been known for their hard-drinking ways when back on shore, the nineties generation began dabbling in narcotics, spending their hard-earned but plentul cash on party drugs before making the inevitable move on to heroin and addiction.And yet, as has become abundantly clear in recent weeks, while the CFP alone is not the cause of all the fishing industryrsquos ills, neither will quitting the EU be the remedy, with Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement all but spelling out that fishing rights will be up for grabs as part of EU-UK trade negotiations. This should come as no surprise given that Norway, which allows EU boats to fish in its waters infor market access, has long been held up as the fishing nation the UK should seek to emulate, but itrsquos not what the Leave campaign led the fishing industry to believe.On top of that, while ldquotaking back control of our waters will inevitably turn out to mean continuing to share control of our waters, Scottish business relationships that have built up because Norway stayed out of the single market will also suffer. Indeed, as Norway pays higher tarfs for processed products than it does for whole fish it sends much of its catch to Scotland, Denmark and Poland to be processed before the finished products make their way tarf-free into the EU. With UK-EU tarfs likely to be imposed it is hard to imagine those Scottish interests surviving the Brexit process, with scores of jobs being lost as a result.It is certainly true that the overly centralised CFP has led to many problems, with absurd amounts of waste being caused by quota-bound fisherman throwing tonnes of dead fish back into the water each year rather than breach the Brussels-set rules. And, yes, the voices of fishermen whose intimate knowledge of the seas has been passed down from generation to generation have been ignored in favour of a one-size-fits-all bureaucratic approach. But as things stand, the best our fishermen can hope for is a continuation of much of what the CFP provides for without the UK ever having a hope of being able to change it.As happened in so many other areas during the Brexit campaign, our fishing communities were sold a lie by the likes of Mr Farage. Having had their deeply held frustrations and fears exploited, surely they now deserve the right for an informed say.

We have lost power retreating behind our British-Tory nationalism lost international credibility, lost European social cohesion and incredible economic value.

And the disastrous alternative of a No Deal hard Brexit is also not what was on offer then. So MPs cannot claim to have a democratic mandate to vote for either of these alternatives. But equally, they have no mandate to vote for us to remain in the EU.Mrs May is now trying to sell her deal to the people ndash thatrsquos fine. But fairness demands that the people are then allowed to have their say in a new referendum, choosing between the three options open to us: Remain, Mayrsquos Brexit and no deal Brexit.No doubt there will be those who will argue that a second referendum, which could overturn the result of the  vote, is undemocratic. But that is clearly nonsense. What would be undemocratic would be to deny voters the opportunity to make a better-informed choice. Although many doubts remain over the details of the two Brexit options now on offer, they are nevertheless far more certain than the fantasy Brexit peddled in  by Messrs Johnson and Rees-Mogg and their right-wing supporters.In addition, the right to vote in this referendum should be extended to include both  and -year-olds and EU nationals who have settled and pay their taxes here. Whatever the result of the referendum, it will have a far greater long-term impact on the lives of the young than on those of us who have retired . So to deny  and -year-olds a voice would be indefensible. And, as for the case of the EU nationals who have settled here and contribute so much to our society, the slogan ldquono taxation without representation is as valid today as it was when it was first coined centuries ago.Alistair Easton, Glencairn Crescent, Edinburgh.ASTONISHINGLY Theresa May claims that ldquoit would be undemocratic to give the British people the final say on whether the UK should leave the European Union in four monthsrsquo time. She claims that knowing the actual terms of the deal, as we now do, makes no dference and has no bearing on the decision taken in the  referendum. That is nonsense ndash far too many were ldquoconned then by the weasel words of Boris Johnston and his friends.Mrs May is taking an astonishing position on a matter of enormous economic and political importance, which will have an effect on every level and aspect of British society for decades to come. She must surely know that there are still deep isions in the country, in Parliament and even in her own party at Westminster. But after the y national debate the British people are now much better informed than when they voted in the referendum, and more aware of the valuable economic and cultural benefits we have enjoyed for the last  years.Of course the fierce nationalistic Brexiteers will still want to ldquotake back our freedom. But many ordinary citizens have now belatedly recognised the many benefits they have enjoyed through EU membership, including the positive impact of EU citizens coming to Britain to work in our health service and other industries. These people have not been ldquotaking our jobs, they have mostly been filling the jobs we did not want to do ourselves. And the ease of movement for British citizens throughout Europe, both for holidays and for business, is now something we take for granted and will miss badly.I fervently hope that the Prime Minister will give the British people the final say in whether we leave the EU, with a decisive referendum in January or February . That would surely be the democratic and sensible thing to do.Iain AD Mann, Kelvin Court, Glasgow.YOU inform us that Theresa May has said that we cannot get a better deal with the EU than the one she has recently signed up to.Dear Mrs May ndash our present agreement as a full member of the EU is by far a better deal.

A final public exhibition will be held on Thursdayat Kinellar Community Hall in Blackburn. Each exhibition will run from  noon to pm.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: “The Scottish Government has given a clear commitment to dual the A which will see delivery of around  miles of upgraded road between Inverness and Aberdeen, a huge task but one we are committed to delivering.“As part of that work, we are taking forward the design work for the  mile stretch of the route between east of Huntly and Aberdeen and now we are able to let people see the initial options we have developed for this challenging section of the A.“A number of options have been deselected at this stage as a result of existing topography, engineering complexity and environmental impact. This includes those near Bennachie and those through Inverurie on the existing A.”The removal of the plan to upgrade the A through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area has been welcomed by Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin.Last month, Ms Martin welcomed campaigners from the Save Bennachie group to meet with new Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to discuss their concerns.The group also previously met with then Economy Minister Keith Brown earlier this year to discuss their opposition to the plans.Ms Martin MSP said: “I am thrilled Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has confirmed the route passing Bennachie has now been dropped.“The Save Bennachie group have tirelessly campaigned and shown true passion and dedication for their cause.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Macdonald Pittodrie House has been shortlisted for the Wedding of the Year category\"  North east hotel makes award finals viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“I commend them all for a campaign which has been time-consuming and, those who were a part of it, for their commitment and determination.“They managed to achieve cross-party support and I know MSPs from all parties shared a collective admiration for them.“I would like to thank the Transport Minister and Transport Scotland for all their work to date and for taking the time to meet with myself, other MSPs and the Save Bennachie team to listen to their views.

it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being.

Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union. I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.”Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what a credit union is. He said: “I’m very pleased to be backing the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign, and I share the Scottish Government’s ambition to grow and raise awareness of this sector. “I’m a member of a credit union myself, and so I know first-hand the benefits they offer. “What’s important to me is that they are owned by the people who actually use their services, and any profits that they make are invested back into the credit union.”A new website has been set up to support the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmA coastal flooding alert has been issued for Orkney by the Scottish Environmental Protection AgencyFloodline Service.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing.

Mossa-Rahmani said that its assets would be “better placed in the bosom” of DNO, which is Norway’s oldest independent oil and gas company.The offer comes on the back of weaker oil prices in recent weeks. The price of Brent crude has tumbled since hitting a four-year high in September, with a barrel trading at  on Monday morning.Analysts at BMO said the offer of p per share was below their valuation of p per share.“DNO’s bid looks opportunistic, coming on the back of recent weakness in commodity markets,” they said.“Faroe’s strong balance sheet and growth trajectory means it is relatively well insulated against short-term oil price moves.”This was echoed by Cantor Fitzgerald, who said: “While DNO’s signicant existing stake may make a takeover now appear ultimately inevitable, in our view investors would be ill-advised to accept what is clearly a “low-ball” offer.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835216.1543345203!/image/image.jpg","title":"aidan smith david attenborough s dynasties is mawkish and overcooked","story":"Aidan Smith wishes the BBC had remembered less can be more before filming Dynasties with David Attenborough.Halfway through Sir David Attenborough’s last series I thought we didn’t love him enough. Blue Planet II won a monster audience but it seemed we were getting complacent and beginning to take these seminal, sensory-overload blockbusters for granted.I didn’t end up writing that piece in praise of him but wish I had because now I find myself cooling on these animal epics. I mean, Attenborough is still a national treasure. He’s still grandad to us all. He’s still the greater pale-blue-shirted warbler on the subject of the natural world. And he’s still the grumpy fellow I interviewed a few years ago, harrumphing at a perfectly innocent enquiry about his thespian brother Dickie. The problem is with his current show, Dynasties.The problem might just be mine. You lot seem to love Dynasties, crying yourselves to sleep every Sunday night at the heart-rending tales from the Arctic tundra and the savanna wilderness. Me, I think I might be turning in a cynic with a hide as tough as that of the exceedingly fat-bottomed hippo which this week refused to become lunch for a ravenous lion.Lions were the focus of the latest programme which was interesting for turning the whole kings-of-the-jungle legend on its head and showing a Masai Mara lioness with a ten-strong pride at risk from hyenas and farmers who lay down poison. But it told its story like televised drama.You knew when the cubs were under threat because suddenly there would be a blast of mawkish muzak. If I was a cub I might prefer to take my chances with the hyenas rather than the overbearing and over-sentimental BBC soundtrack department. But I am not a cub and lions are not humans.More and more, though, nature shows are resembling dramas in their construction, and especially the soapier kind. Dramas must contain a sufficient amount of sex and death, laughter and tears. The narrative must toy with our emotions with a carefully-controlled ebb and flow. All of this is scripted it has to be. Dramas are heightened reality because reality in its unnished state can be supremely dull. My le is tedious and I bet yours is even worse. But nature shows are supposed to be factual.Watching the most recent episode of Dynasties and the moments of face-licking tenderness within the pride, I couldn’t help wonderingthese happened right on cue, or whether the film was re-ordered later in the editing suite to induce the desired collective tingle in the audience. I know what you’re thinking: “What a ridiculous way to spend Sunday night!” Well, there’s an unfortunate history of nature programmes bending reality with polar bears in Dutch zoos standing in for the Arctic version and semi-domesticated wolves body-doubling for wild ones. Then there was the baby iguana vs racer snake outrage from Planet Earth II. This incredible chase sequence won a Bafta and was viewed by comedienne Ellen Degeneres as a symbol of hope after a racer snake got into the White House. “This baby iguana is all of us,” she tweeted. But then the producers admitted the scene had been stitched together from dferent bits of footage, adding: “Snakes and iguanas aren’t very good at ‘takes’.”So was this really an outrage - a “fakery storm”, in the words of one Beeb-bashing newspaper  Did you feel cheated  Perhaps not, and maybe you went away from that series with a greater understanding and appreciation of the animal world. But I repeat: animals are not humans. More and more of us are performers, evenwe’re not proper actors, for it can seem like we’re all queuing up backstage at a reality show to be asked formatted questions by Dermot O’Leary which never change and are specically intended to make us cry. Animals shouldn’t have to follow scripts. I mean, it’s not asthey’re performing seals .Ah yes, there’s been a lot of blubbing over Dynasties. On Sunday the lioness was forced to leave behind a sick cub for the sake of the rest of the pride. The previous week Emperor penguins in Antarctica were blown into an icy ravine and when a chick couldn’t climb out it was left by its mother, seemingly to perish - until the film crew decided to dig steps in the gully walls.Maybe you cried at these scenes accompanied by Attenborough’s tremulous, portentous delivery - or maybe you cried when the production team cried at the end of both episodes. The intervention in Antarctica has been much-debated - shouldn’t nature be allowed to take it course, however grim  - but personally I’m more bothered by the intervention of the cameramen during the last ten minutes of nature programmes to tell us how they got all the shots. There’s great skill involved, I don’t doubt that, and the best will be rewarded when the telly awards are handed out. But there’s skill in all technical work and, for instance, we never heard from the cameraman on Bodyguard who could have reasonably claimed: “How I made British politics more interesting and got you all lusting after the Home Secretary.”The BBC, of course, likes to blow its own trumpet. These inserts are also evidence that everyone’s a star these days or thinks they are. Even cameramen are playing to the camera. But maybe the problem with Dynasties is that it was designed as a smaller work compared with the Blue Planets and Planet Earths and, impatient for the next super-series, the Beeb have overcooked it. There’s a more sizable problem to come for the Corporation, however: that super-series will be on Netflix. The big beast of animal TV is reaching for the higher, more luscious branches where the rewards are greater. That’s simply nature.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835049.1543309036!/image/image.jpg","title":"catherine stihler countdown to brexit should be stopped before it blows up in our faces","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Today, in Luxembourg, the European Court of Justice will meet to hear the case for halting the disastrous Brexit process. This day has been a long time coming the culmination of a legal battle that has rumbled on for almost a year.Can Westminster unilaterally stop the Article  ticking clock which was triggered by Theresa May in March , and is set to chime in March next year After hearing the case today, the ECJ will retire to consider a verdict – and we’ll be told the answer in the coming weeks.The case was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians, including me and my Labour MEP colleague David Martin. The team also includes Green MSP Andy Wightman, who has been leading from the front, as well as his ­colleague Ross Greer, SNP MEP Alyn Smith and SNP MP Joanna Cherry.Throughout the process we have been backed by Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project, and we’re incredibly grateful for the ­support we have received from all those who donated to the crowdfunding appeal.Legal cases like this don’t come cheap. But this is not some publicity stunt or futile endeavour – it’s a vital test to find outwe can call a halt to the Brexit catastrophe.Everyone involved in this fight campaigned hard against Brexit in the  referendum. We knew that leaving the EU would cost jobs, stle economic growth and put workers’ rights at risk.When we need solidarity between nations more than ever, breaking away from this unique partnership was never going to be the best choice for our country.But we lost the contest ­following a referendum where the Leave campaign lied and cheated, ­peddling myths about NHS funding and scaremongering about immigration.In the immediate aftermath of that vote, there was a need for calm and cool heads. I still shudder when recalling how Jeremy Corbyn – a lelong Eurosceptic – said we should immediately trigger Article  the following morning.The Prime Minister took a bit more time and pressed the button on March , . But she did so without any knowledge of what the Brexit deal would look like.There had been no negotiations with EU member states no agreement within her Cabinet. She started the two-year clock ticking without a clue about what she could achieve. It was an utterly reckless decision by a Prime Minister which generations of history students will learn about for decades to come.The UK Tory government gave the impression that that was it: the ­decision was final.But Lord Kerr, the author of the Article  notice, has said the ­Government can withdraw its letter and stop the processit wishes to.Jean-Claude Piris, the former head of the European Council’s legal service, has also said: “Article  is based on the principle that withdrawing from the EU is a unilateral decision. Nobody can force a state to leave.”So we lodged papers in the ­Scottish courts, seeking a ruling from the national court to the ECJ for a definitive ruling – bearing in mind that the Article  process has never been used before.Our first attempt failed – a Court of Session judge initially felt the issue was hypothetical as the UK Government had stated it did not intend to halt the process.But our appeal was successful, as Scotland’s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, determined it was clear – in terms of the European UnionAct – that MPs will be required to vote on whether to raty the Brexit deal.It is neither academic nor ­premature to ask whether it is ­legally competent to revoke the Article  notication.The Court of Session sent a ­reference to the ECJ seeking a ­ruling, but the UK Government – in an act of sheer desperation – lodged an appeal at the Supreme Court in London. This was quickly dismissed, as the court confirmed it is the ECJ which “must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision”.So that is how we have got to today.Since the legal process began, “Chequers” has come and gone, and the Prime Minister’s worst-of-all-worlds deal was agreed by the EU at the weekend.It’s a bad deal for the economy with no guarantee of frictionless trade in the future it’s a bad deal for workers with no guarantees that Britain will keep EU standards on workers’ rights and it’s a bad deal for ­consumers with no guarantees on continued consumer rights.The end of free movement will be harmful for economic growth here at home, but also for young people who will be denied the opportunity to travel, work, live, love and explore throughout the whole of the EU. It’s a deal which should be voted down by MPs in the Commons.I very much hope the Luxembourg verdict is known before that meaningful vote takes place in ­Parliament. MPs should await the outcome, as a positive verdict would give them the option of pausing Brexit – not just picking between the dreadful choice of Mrs May’s deal or no-deal.I am confident this alternative will be available. We must hold our nerve. We owe it to every voter in the UK to ensure that all avenues are fully explored.Why are we running headlong towards this fork in the road where the signposts are ‘deal’ or ‘no deal’  Let’s pause before we reach the fork and reconsider our options.Or – even better – let’s build an alternative path that’s signposted ‘people’s vote’. On this route we can put control back in the hands of the public – and let them decidethis Brexit chaos is really worth it.Catherine Stihler is a Labour MEP for Scotland.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835232.1543266282!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis not enough fish in the sea for brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Fishermen were told Brexit would make them winners. That looks dficult to achieve, writes Paris GourtsoyannisUntil now, it’s been easy to dismiss the debate over fishing after Brexit as a parochial one.The industry makes up less than half a percent of UK GDP. Fishing interests are concentrated in a small number of communities, so the issue is wrapped up in retail politics. Because fishing disproportionately affects Scotland – six of the ten biggest ports for fish landings are north of the Border – any discussion has long since been colonised by the bigger constitutional debate. The UK was barely in the door of the EU when that happened.Well, fishing isn’t a local issue anymore. It’s not even merely a national concern.In fact, fishing is set to become the UK’s first international trade row of the post-Brexit era.Emmanuel Macron’s reasons for making it so might have little to do with fishing. The French President is confronting his toughest ever challenge as he tries to face down protesters causing chaos over a hike in fuel taxes. The demonstrations have turned deadly, and Macron may have tried to write a few headlines about a tough stand in Brussels in a vain attempt to distract from the anger of the ‘gilet jaune’ protests.Whatever his reasons, it was clear Macron was intent on making waves over fishing from the moment he turned up in Brussels for the EU Council summit. He used his TV clip on arrival to thank Michel Barnier for ensuring “reciprocal access” to fishing waters was part of the withdrawal deal and pledged that French fishermen would be “well defended” in trade talks to come.• : Brexit: Theresa May confirms date of meaningful voteHe wasn’t alone: Denmark, Germany Belgium, Ireland and Spain all have a stake in ensuring their fishing fleets can continue to access the UK’s waters after Brexit, and the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte reflected that in his own comments.“We have a big interest here, but also so does the UK to maintain market access to the EU for products coming out of UK waters,” he said, trying to sell the UK on something it really doesn’t want to do. The strength of that coalition was reflected in the minutes of the discussion the EU held before Theresa May came in the room: that a UK-EU fishing deal “should be built on... existing reciprocal access and quota shares”.In the concluding press conference a few hours later, Macron was asked what kind of leverage he had to make that happen. The French President pushed the red button and sent a Trident nuclear weapon shooting out of the waters of the North Sea:that fisheries deal isn’t done by the time the transition period ends, the EU will trigger the backstop intended to prevent a hard border in Ireland. The effect would be to keep the UK stuck in the customs union against its will.• : “I can’t imagine that the desire of Theresa May or her supporters is to remain for the long term in a customs union,” Macron said himself, barely disguising the threat and ruthlessly making it about the Prime Minister’s own political position. Because, unlike the withdrawal agreement, a trade deal must be approved unanimously, Macron has that leverage.Don’t be surprised at the power plays and the personal attacks. Fishing is fertile water for conflict. The UK and EU have overlapping interests: European fishermen, who catch two-thirds of the fish pulled out of British waters, make their living in the seas around the UK. British fishermen, meanwhile, make their living in the fish markets of Europe: it’s estimated that  per cent of the UK’s catch is exported, most of it to the continent.Moreover, it’s the UK fishermen who need frictionless access to the EU as much as any British industry. Their product is among the most perishable. A few months back I wrote about a Caithness shellfish producer who enthusiastically supported Brexit, but knocked on his MP’s door afterwards asking for a soft exit deal. If Scottish langoustines take an extra half day to clear customs at Boulogne, that market is finished. Both sides should want a deal, particularly as the fish British consumers like to eat – cod and haddock – are largely imported, while the fish Europeans prefer – herring and mackerel – are among the UK’s biggest exports. A breakdown in the fish trade will hit consumers and fishermen on all sides.It’s politics that stands in the way. The biggest indignity the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy imposed on British fishermen wasn’t the scrappage scheme , restrictive quotas or wasteful discards. It was the knowledge that others were often taking more out of their seas than they were.No-one believed more fervently that Brexit would make them and their community a winner than fishermen. It’s pretty clear what a win looks like Theresa May said it herself in a brief but telling comment: her deal would “deliver a bigger annual quota” for the UK.That’s what this row is about, and how the government will ultimately be judged by fishing interests. Not on the minutiae of the legal agreement between London and Brussels, whether it stands alone or is folded into a wider trade deal. But whether fishing communities feel like winners when the boats come back in.The problem is this: environmental groups say nearly half of the North Sea’s fish stocks continue to be overexploited, despite the central aim of the CFP being to prevent ecological and economic disaster. Even stocks that are recovering, like cod, are still at historic lows.Last year, the EU agreed to tough new measures under the CFP aimed at preventing overfishing by preventing quotas from exceeding levels regarded as sustainable by scientists. Those measures, which will undoubtedly be part of discussions about a new UK-EU fishing regime after Brexit, were welcomed by the Environment Secretary, Michael Gove – both a leading Brexiteer and someone who has rebuilt his political brand since  through his environmental credentials.British fishermen want a bigger share of the catch. European fishermen won’t accept a smaller share. Environmentalists say no-one can catch much more than they do now. Mathematically and politically, the two positions can’t be reconciled.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"views sought on fishing after brexit ","story":"“What will Brexit mean for your fishing community ” – was the question posed by university academics this week.But sadly the public event on Wednesday night at the Thule Bar in Lerwick did not pull in visitors to share their views.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job.

He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BALMACARA-SCULPTURE-GREG-2.jpg","title":"meet donald the new animated face of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local businessman from Skye has created an animated character with the aim of providing useful information to visitors to the island.Donald from Skye is an animated character and the star of a short film about the island.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newly published childrens book aims to teach important message for a worthy cause","story":"A new children’s book, designed to introduce small children to the world’s big issues and aid vital charity work, is the latest work of West Belfast woman Arlene Gormley.Co-founder of the Feeding Dreams Cambodia charity, Arlene has penned, designed and illustrated ‘ Not A Fairytale’ describing how even from a young age we can work to make the planet better for now and future generations.Feeding Dreams Cambodia was founded in  and offers free education and nutrition for  children in Cambodia’s tourist capital of Siem Reap. The charity receives no government funding and relies solely on donations, most of which comes from support and fundraising drives in Belfast. Arlene explained how the book is based on the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goalsthat recognise ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education.“Our approach at Feeding Dreams is holistic,” explained Arlene. “ Our programmes in education, medical care, community support, vocational training, they are all interlinked, so when the UN announced the  Goals, it helped give us the framework and language for our strategy. Since each of our programmes can be tied to one of the  SDGs and the Cambodian government ratied the SDGs, it gave us legitimacy and credibility.”“I decided to create a handmade book introducing the SDGs to young children through colourful pictures with simplistic explanations. The book was originally intended as a keepsake for my four-year-old niece Zara but the message has struck a chord with parents and teachers. I’m holding a book launch on Saturday in the city centre’s Learning Space store and all sales from the book will go towards the work of the charity. “During the Christmas period people are very generous with their donations but it’s when all the rush calms down and we go into what we call our ‘leaner’ months of January, February that we need that extra push make sure all the children receive a proper, balanced meal.”Arlene became a mother herself in August and is now more determined than ever to ensure her daughter Julia has a keen understanding of the world around her.“Children are born into an uncertain and unequal world and parents worry about the kind of environment their children grow up in. It’s important to me that my daughter understands from a early age about important issues that will affect her future, like climate change, access to health and education, and the importance of equality.” The Queen’s University graduate spoke of how the visually striking picture book was “something a little dferent” for the bedtime hour. “It’s a great way to sit with a child and read each chapter, look at the illustrations, it’s a great tool to show what is going on in the world and at the same time contribute to the work of Feeding Dreams.”Arlene will be signing copies of her book at Fountain Centre’s Learning Space store on Saturday, December  from am until noon. Not A Fairytale is priced at £.

More than , local children live in homes haunted by poverty.That means families with increasing debts, choices between ‘heat or eat’, teenagers with a limited or non-existent social le and an increased risk of chronic illness.”She continued: “Children living in poverty also consistently underperform at school and find it harder to get a job when they leave.“The highest levels of poverty are to be found in the Colin Glen and Falls areas,” she added.North Belfast follows closely behind the West Belfast statistics with , children living in child poverty. In South Belfast the figures are just over half of this with , children affected. East Belfast stands at ,.Research by Save the Children has shown that around  per cent of parents in poverty say their children have to go without new shoes when they need them and a large number of children in poverty say they are missing out on things that many other children take for granted, such as going on school trips and having a warm coat in winter.“The introduction of Universal Credit, cuts to health and education budgets, pressures on community, voluntary and youth services all compound the problems already affecting thousands of local families – many of them with a least one partner working, it is unforgivable,” said Ms Lowry.“While in Government Sinn Féin and the DUP refused to implement the promised Anti- Poverty Strategy and sent powers relating to Universal Credit to Westminster. As a result thousands of local children and their families continue to suffer a hardship and deprivation that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.“If there is a more important political priority in West Belfast than addressing child poverty, then perhaps some local MLAs would like to tell me about it.”Commenting on the report and its findings West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said that the issue of child poverty needs to #reduce and reduce rapidly#.#In my view one child living in poverty is one too many.

Mrs May met with representatives of Northern Irelands main political parties as part of her visit.Sinn Fein, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Greens have given their backing to the Prime Ministers deal while the DUP and UUP have rejected it, calling it a threat to the union.The DUP is unhappy that the deal will see Northern Ireland aligned with EU rules and remain part of the single market with checks on some goods coming in from the UK to Northern Ireland,the Brexit backstop is implemented.The Irish Government and EU leaders signed off at the deal at an EU Summit in Brussels on Sunday. Mrs Mays deal faces an uphill battle to get through Parliament with Labour and many of her own MPs calling for the deal to be renegotiated.The Conservative Party currently relies on the support of the DUPs ten MPs to pass key legislation as part of their confidence and supply agreement. Speaking after the meeting Mrs Foster said that the Brexit withdrawal agreement was not acceptable to the DUP in its current form.The Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA said that there was no way the Prime Minister could persuade her party to accept it. Mrs Foster was accompanied to the meeting by DUP MEP Diane Dodds and her partys Assembly Chief Whip Gordon Lyons. She said that the proposed deal would \"place barriers to our greatest market and it would lock us into accepting rules and regulations from Brussels with absolutely no democratic control over those rules.\" \"There are a growing number of voices right across the House of Commons who oppose the withdrawal agreement. They see good parts but they want the backstop to be binned. With no enthusiasm amongst parliamentarians for the withdrawal agreement, it seems destined to be rejected by the House of Commons,\" Mrs Foster said.\"We have urged the Prime Minister to dump her PR plans for the withdrawal agreement and instead work on finding a better way forward. If the backstop was removed, then consensus could be achieved.\"Mrs Foster urged Mrs May to reconsider, saying there was a potential Brexit deal that would work for everyone. We should not be pressurised into accepting a deal that senior figures, including the Chancellor, have said is bad for the economy and bad for the Union because of a  choice that there is no alternative.  There is another way.  This is not a binary choice. We need to explore that third way,\" the DUP leader said.Prime Minister Theresa at Queens University in Belfast, during her visit to Northern Ireland. Photo credit: Liam McBurney PA Wire\"The European Union will obviously say there can be no change right until the moment they accept change. Presently there is absolutely no pressure on them to sht their position because the United Kingdom isn’t even asking. \"Now is the time to accept that the Withdrawal Agreement, as it currently stands, is damaging and that the United Kingdom cannot accept it. The conversation can then begin to ensure we get a deal that works for everyone.\"After meeting with Mrs May in Belfast, Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald said that the current deal was \"imperfect\" but represented the \"least worst option\".In contrast to Mrs Fosters comments the Sinn Fein leader said there can be \"no renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement\".“The backstop as contained in the withdrawal agreement is the bottom line. This is what Brexit looks like.

The leading architect revealed he had received more than a dozen unsolicited emails from engineers and geologists inquiring about the project since the speech on Saturday. “It has been bubbling along since January,” said Professor Dunlop. “I thought that was the end of it, and then something  happens.“And then with Boris Johnson, Karen Bradley and the DUP bringing it up again, it just seems like a potential story and narrative which keeps moving on.”Last week the bridge was raised during a discussion in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster. Responding to a question from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Secretary of State Karen Bradley said she was willing to have a discussion about commissioning a feasibility study on the bridge, but noted there were issues around the sea bed and the current site of the proposed bridge link. Addressing the DUP annual conference on Saturday, former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said proposals for a bridge link were being held back by the “absence of political will”. “I think that there will be a feasibility study, which is all I can ask for. That’s all I’ve ever asked for,” said Professor Dunlop.“I am not suggesting for a moment it is going to be a walk in the park. Instead people providing opinions about whether it can be done or not, it would be good to actually get the facts.”Boris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and ScotlandSDLP MLA criticises Paisley for obsessing over Northern Ireland to Scotland bridgeMr Johnson first expressed his support for a bridge back in June, when he called for the proposal to be taken “seriously”. Mr Dunlop first envisioned the idea for the bridge link after being asked to do so by a newspaper in Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route — one from Larne and Portpatrick, potentially costing around £bn or a shorter crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head, which could cost between £bn and £bn.The proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would “initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity” between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important “that all options are fully considered”."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster seats decision for brexit vote up to sinn fein says pm","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to elect MPs who would take up their seats.“Sinn Fein is an unusual party in that it isn’t taking up its seats in Westminster for one reason and not taking its seats in Stormont for another,” he added.“Generally, people who get involved in politics do so because they want to make a dference and they want to use the democratic process to get good outcomes for their citizens.“If they are not

This will reassure parents, and the authors advocate that no parent should be expected to search through their child’s faeces to prove object retrieval.”Ultimately the team acknowledges the study was not “hard science” but just “a bit of fun in the run-up to Xmas”.They point out that because of the small sample size, and the fact that the subjects in the study were adults rather than children, “it is important that you don’t extrapolate the data to the entire population of Lego swallowers”.Researchers were keen to stress that people should not replicate the study at home – and that parents should contact a doctorthey are concerned about anything their child has swallowed."},{"url":null,"title":"harry kanes multitasking parenting photo prompted much hilarity on twitter","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

would highlight the appearance of INLA graffiti in a number of areas, particularly in Ballymagroarty, and almost a parallel link in attacks on people and property in the estate,” he said.“There’s

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI.

We look forward to the rest of that money being delivered for all of the people of Northern Ireland.”Mrs Foster added: “It is very offensive to raise this in terms of money. We are talking about the constitutional and economic long-term future of Northern Ireland – so the answer is no.”Mrs Foster suggested opposition to Mrs May’s deal at Westminster was “coalescing” around the Irish border backstop proposal – the controversial measure that could see Northern Ireland operate under a dferent regulatory regime to the rest of the UK to ensure a free-flowing border.Prime Minister Theresa May meets with young farmers and students at Queens University in Belfast, during her visit to Northern Ireland“Soshe ditches the backstop there is every reason to believe that this withdrawal agreement could go through,” she added.All five of the main Stormont parties held talks with Theresa May at Stormont House on Tuesday.The prime minister heard a range of views, with the DUP and Ulster Unionists voicing opposition to the deal and Sinn Fein, SDLP and Alliance all stressing the importance of maintaining the backstop.Ahead of the meeting, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “No matter what happens on the th of December, no matter what happens in the House of Commons, the backstop needs to be banked.“It needs to be banked in the event of an extension of Article , it needs to be banked in the event of a people’s vote or another election, or any of those outcomes.“People here will not be used in the political machinations that are going in Westminster – we need to be protected.”Mr Eastwood again criticised the position taken by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has voiced concern about the emergence of trade barrier down the Irish Sea.Sinn Fein welcome prison release of Tony Taylor after  days Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I think he has called this wrong, because he is starting to talk about a border down the Irish Sea and the integrity of the United Kingdom,” said Mr Eastwood.“This is not about any of that, thi s is about economics, this is about protecting people here from a hard border, because we all know how dangerous a hard border would be in Ireland, not just economically but politically as well.”He insisted nothing in the deal undermined the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom, insisting the principle of consent outlined in the Good Friday Agreement was “sacrosanct”.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann urged an extension of Article  to give the government more time to strike a better deal.He said the current agreement would leave Northern Ireland as a “place completely apart” from the rest of the UK within five to  years.In an appeal to Mrs May, Mr Swann said: “Take the time, put plans in place to allow for the extension of Article , to allow further negotiation so we can get a deal that actually works, because one thing that we don’t want, that we realise doesn’t work for Northern Ireland, is no deal.“This is the first time the prime minister has been to Northern Ireland since the Withdrawal Agreement was published and her government and she has said that this will affect Northern Ireland the most as an integral part of the United Kingdom.“So let’s take time. Once she has heard the concerns from all of the Northern Ireland let’s see how we can take it to the next step.”Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said the backstop had to be retained as a “safety net”.“It is important that we do bank the backstop,” he said.“It’s clearly our preference that we stay in the European Union, we don’t believe that there is any such thing as a good or sensible Brexit.“But right across the community in Northern Ireland – including most of the political parties, most of the business community and most of society – it is very, very clear that people do not want to see a no-deal situation, which would be a complete catastrophe for our society.”try catch     .               ..

deal to politicians and the wider public.The prime minister has embarked on a two-week campaign to win approval for her withdrawal agreement ahead of a crunch vote in the Commons on December .Theresa Mays visit to Northern Ireland is part of a two-week campaign to sell her Brexit withdrawal dealAnd while the accord has received the backing of business and farming leaders in the Province, the PM faces an uphill battle to get the deal through parliament, with fierce resistance from the DUP, opposition parties and many of her own MPs.During her trip to Belfast, Mrs May will set out how she believes her deal strengthens the Union and “delivers for every corner of the UK”.Making her case, she will take part in a round-table discussion at Queen’s University Belfast with groups from across society, including students, academics and community and religious leaders.She will then meet with all five of NI’s main political parties, where she will urge politicians to back her plan.Speaking ahead of her visit to the Province, the PM said the UK would be leaving the bloc “as one”.“My deal delivers for every corner of the UK and I will work hard to strengthen the bonds that unite us as we look ahead to our future outside of the EU,” she added.Mrs May also asserted that the agreement reached on the backstop “honours the Belfast Agreement” and “ensures there will be noto the borders of the past”.She added: “This deal avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. This has been at the forefront of my mind throughout the negotiations. It has been especially clear to me when I have visited communities along the border in Northern Ireland and seen first-hand how important it is that the unique circumstances local employers face are recognised in any agreement.“They need to be able to trade freely across the border with Ireland and have unfettered access to the rest of the United Kingdom’s market. This deal makes that possible and that’s why, across Northern Ireland, employers large and small have been getting behind it.”Leaders in the business and farming sectors have expressed their support for the deal and publicly warned about the potential consequences of no deal for NI.Larne male assaulted during burglaryHistoric ‘meaningful vote’ on historic Brexit deal set for December  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But the DUP has warned thatthe backstop is triggered, it will carve NI off from the rest of the UK.The party is concerned the backstop could threaten the constitutional integrity of the Union and place a regulatory border down the Irish Sea, leaving NI aligned to some EU rules post-Brexit.UUP leader Robin Swann has called on the PM to put plans in place for the extension of Article  “rather than risk the future of the Union for the sake of meeting a deadline”.The North Antrim MLA added: “We do not believe that this withdrawal agreement is as good as it gets. Andthe price to pay for it continues to be a border up the Irish Sea, we will continue to oppose it and tell the prime minister that the UK Government needs to go back to the negotiating table.”Meanwhile, the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland has voiced its opposition to the draft agreement, warning that it would “diminish the constitutional integrity of the UK”.It came as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with the Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Reverend Mervyn Gibson in Dublin yesterday.try catch     .               ..

OK, he and his we have jetted off to Lanzarote to get a break from work, the weather and, of course, the furore over Brexit. Sandra ChapmanHe wouldn’t normally decide to take a break at this time of year. But, as a Brexiteer, he says he has had his fill of politicians, politics and the  promises over Brexit. He says he will be back, but threatens to emigratethe country falls apart.He got a lot of sympathy from Himself who also has flown off this week to the British mainland leaving me with just the dog, which I’m pretty sure is happy to get a bit of peace and quiet from the pair of us who really haven’t been able to argue in any logical fashion about the political crisis surrounding us. Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting.

Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
