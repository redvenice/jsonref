So far Pfizer and Moderna\u0027s studies have only looked at how people given two doses react to the South African variant, and Britain has decided to delay giving people two doses to get more people jabbed quickly.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson confirmed last week that its world-first single shot jab, which Britain has pre-ordered 30million doses of, blocked 57 per cent of coronavirus infections in South Africa, which meets the World Health Organization\u0027s 50 per cent efficacy threshold and hints that one shot may be enough to fend off the new strain. That jab is expected to be rolled out in the coming months once it seals approval.Studies into Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca\u0027s jab, which Britain has ordered 100million doses of and is already dishing out to the most vulnerable, and the South African strain are still ongoing. Reacting to today\u0027s announcement, Professor Jonathan Ball, a molecular virologist at the University of Nottingham, said: \u0027We know that some coronavirus variants might be less easily killed by antibodies raised against some of the existing vaccines, but the levels of immunity are hopefully still sufficient to prevent serious disease. \u0027But we can\u0027t be certain that vaccine immunity might not be adversely impacted, especially after a single dose, which is why it is important to try to prevent these variants from spreading widely. \u0027That will mean effective social distancing and identifying where the variants are currently circulating, so we can stop them in their tracks through effective testing, track and trace and isolating infected iniduals.\u0027The South African variant carries 21 mutations, some of which change the shape of the spike protein, which the virus uses to bind to human cells, on its outside. The two worrying mutations it carries are known as E484K and N501Y.N501Y appears to make it better able to stick to the cells inside the body and makes it more likely to cause infection and faster to spread. This is the same mutation found on the Kent variant, which is at least 50 per cent more infectious than regular Covid and possibly more deadly.Scientists believe E484K may be associated with an ability to evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. Researchers suspect this is the case because strains with this mutation have been shown to reinfect people who caught and beat older versions of Covid.  Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, added: \u0027The presence of the \u0027South African\u0027 variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus in the UK has been recorded previously but has ultimately been linked to travel there. \u0027This variant not only appears to spread rapidly, but there is emerging evidence to suggest that it is less susceptible to immunity induced by the current crop of vaccines. The discovery of a handful of cases with no links to travel to Africa, indicates that it might be more widespread in the community than previously thought.\u0027Detecting this is a success story for the UK\u0027s coronavirus genome sequencing programme. This spread, even if small in scale, needs to be brought under control quickly, so Public Health England\u0027s house-to-house checks, and intensive testing are the right thing to do. Anyone testing positive for the coronavirus must isolate to stop the spread.\u0027Professor Rowland Kao, Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science, University of Edinburgh, said: \u0027The identification of cases of the SA variant in people with no obvious travel links (either travel themselves, or links to other known cases) suggest that, at the very least, they were infected while in the UK – i.e. there is evidence of local transmission. \u0027As only 5 per cent of cases are tested to determine if they are the variant, there is a high probability that further local cases are in circulation – making it more difficult at the spread of the variant can be contained. \u0027Surge testing, i.e where all residents will be offered a PCR test via post will aim therefore to identify variant clusters and extent of spread, but is highly dependent on iniduals taking up those tests, as it remains a voluntary activity. \u0027As there is some evidence that current vaccines may be at least somewhat less effective against this variant, slowing its spread via surge testing and maintaining travel restrictions to prevent it jumping to other areas of the UK (if it has not done so already) will be important to keep COVID-19 infections continuing downwards at its current trajectory.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Extremely rare BLACK leopard spotted Indian wildlife park tries hunt deer","story":"Share this article   Anurag said, \u0027We were tracking a tiger but on the way on Tadoba lake we heard a deer call and at the next moment we saw Black leopard.

Now, they have both been honoured for their contributionsAmong the household names featured on the new year honours list, you’ll find hundreds of key workers and community champions who stepped up during the pandemic and made a huge inidual impact.Here, we meet two of them: a child and adolescent psychiatrist and a pub general manager who, thanks to their innovative thinking, enriched the lives of those in their community – and beyond.“During the pandemic, people Zoomed, Skyped and connected with families digitally, so why can’t we connect healthcare the same way,” asks consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist Prof Alka Surajprakash Ahuja, from Cardiff, who was awarded an MBE for her services to the NHS during Covid-19. Ahuja received the honour for her pivotal role in setting up the pioneering NHS Wales Video Consulting Service, which digitally connects patients with clinicians.The programme’s success means the focus was extended to care homes, too. “That was a place where we had the most vulnerable people who needed help, but professionals were very limited in terms of access. It allowed GPs to do virtual rounds, continuing to provide the support and care they needed.” Dentistry, optometry and pharmacy followed, with video appointments revolutionising the way a growing number of patients accessed healthcare. Ahuja’s research into video appointments also led her to investigate their value for schools. “We know schools are not going to be the same for a long, long time. But children and young people still need support for their mental and physical health, so that will hopefully enable remote delivery of care into school settings,” she says.The technology has proved life-changing. “One of our first patients was an elderly gentleman living on his own. He had an appointment with the oncologist – it was a newly diagnosed tumour that was probably cancerous. He was very anxious, which was understandable. What helped was his daughter in London and his son in Singapore could join the appointment virtually, which under normal circumstances wouldn’t be possible. It meant having family for the appointment was much more reassuring and helped contain his anxiety. When we spoke to him, he was in tears. He said: ‘My god, I just couldn’t believe it – it was like my daughter and son sitting next to me in the appointment.’”Despite the punishing workload, witnessing the results has made it worthwhile. “I think one thing that kept us going was that we all believed this was going to make a difference,” she says. “I still remember the day I left my clinical job – it was hard because I thought I’m not going to see my patients and it’s going to be next to impossible. My colleague said: ‘Don’t worry, you’re making history’ and I laughed. Now, I think what we have done has been amazing. Post-Covid, healthcare is not going to be the same – it’s going to change the landscape.”As general manager of the Portsmouth Arms in Basingstoke, Richard Curtis was awarded a BEM for services to charity and the community in Hampshire during the pandemic. At the time of the announcement, he had raised £52,500 for charity through the virtual pub quizzes he has hosted on Facebook since the outbreak of the pandemic. With a modest goal of £150, his first quiz – which began the day after pubs closed last March – quickly gained traction, turning into a nightly occurrence. “I never expected it to be anything other than my regulars who come to the pub, and to maybe attract a bit of a local audience,” he says. “We didn’t expect it to go worldwide.”Curtis, who estimates he’s now held around 300 online quizzes since March and is still going strong, has seen his efforts bring together people from around the globe in a bid to help alleviate loneliness and isolation. With the first quiz drawing around 120 participants, at its peak up to 1,500 people were joining online.“From March, it very quickly went from one quiz a week to 18,” he says. “We were doing a children’s one Monday to Friday, which I hosted with my children. I was then doing an adult one every night, and then on Saturday and Sunday I did a themed quiz at three o’clock, another at five, then an adults’ one at eight.”With each quiz filmed inside the pub (Curtis lives upstairs with his wife and three children) it offered “the feel of the pub” for those missing it. “I made a rule that if people couldn’t come to the pub, I wouldn’t be drinking, but that soon turned into people saying: ‘If we donate £200, will you have a beer?’”The biggest quiz – a world record attempt held across VE Day weekend that lasted an astonishing 35 hours – raised more than £21,000 for charity (the world record status is still pending). “The money we raised was beyond anybody’s belief. That weekend there was so much hope for what people could have done, and what they were actually allowed to do,” he says of the weekend, falling during the first national lockdown.The world record attempt was surprisingly gruelling, he says. “I just imagined I’d have to write loads of questions and stay awake. But sitting in that position for so long, my back was shot to pieces. And while staying awake for so long isn’t a problem, constantly talking for that amount of time is. Because I’d been talking for so long, my throat and tongue had swollen up so much that I couldn’t eat. I tried to eat a bacon sandwich at one point and choked, I just couldn’t swallow it.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Here’s how to make life a little easier for yourself and your children With schools shut for the foreseeable future to all except the children of critical workers and vulnerable children as the government tries to help stop the spread of Covid-19, you may find yourself struggling to know how best to support your child’s learning from home. Many of us are feeling completely overwhelmed by having to educate our children remotely again, nearly 11 months into the pandemic, often while juggling our own work commitments.As a parent, it’s only natural to worry about the impact of such disruption on a child’s educational progress and wellbeing. With children of all ages currently out of school with no definitive return date, it is difficult to know what they “should” be achieving on a day-to-day basis and how you can help them get the most out of this unpredictable time. So we spoke to Emma Marshall – a senior school headteacher, and clinical child psychologist Dr Kate Mason, to find out the real impact of this continuing situation on children and their top five tips on how we can really help them.Emma Marshall is headteacher at Havelock academy in Grimsby. Her main focus during the current lockdown is to ensure that parents and students have easy access to all of the tools needed to continue learning online, in a way that supports their needs as a family. She says that although she is a teacher, she also faces real challenges as a mum in overseeing the remote learning of her 12-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son. She recommends:1 Make it suit your family situationEveryone’s home situation and setup is different and as a headteacher my priority is to make sure that our parents and students feel supported, and know how to easily access the learning resources provided. Along with live lessons, we’re also putting together paper packs of work for those who would really struggle accessing everything online as we understand that not everyone has the technology, or perhaps it’s just not suitable for their learning style or their family situation. The main thing to remember is that we are here for you, so if something just isn’t working for you or your child with regards to the lessons being provided, tell us so that we can help. Don’t feel you’re alone in this because I guarantee nearly every parent and teacher will be feeling the same in some regards.2 Prioritise some sort of routineIf nothing else, I would absolutely encourage parents to make sure their kids get up, get showered and dressed and not spend the day in their pyjamas. That way, when they sit down to do some work, it’s mentally like they’re approaching an actual school day. (However, I think putting school uniforms on might be a step too far!) In the first few days of this lockdown I’d return home from work to find our 12-year-old daughter with her laptop, under a duvet and still in her pyjamas. So I said no. Now she knows she must brush her teeth, get washed and dressed and eat something nutritious at a sensible lunchtime – as she would do normally. Because they will have to come back to school at some point. Straying too far from a normal routine and good habits will just make the return to normality even harder.3 Check in with your childTalk to your children – ask them how they’re doing and, most importantly, how they’re feeling. Ask them to tell you five things they’ve learned that day. And remember to reward them. It doesn’t have to be with physical rewards, it can just be a “well done” when you can see that they’ve attempted to do something. Praise goes a long way, especially at the moment. Make sure your child knows that they can get in touch with their school with any problems at all – however big or small it seems to them, their teacher will want to know if they’re struggling in any way whatsoever. Encourage daily exercise away from the screen. They may have some amazing online provision but they don’t want to be in front of their screens all day. Getting out and having a walk is really important. Reading a book, engaging with pets and speaking to their friends is all to be encouraged, as much as the home learning.4 You don’t have to do everythingDon’t try to do everything that the school is setting. I promise that nobody is going to tell you that you’re doing a terrible job. I think it’s important that we think back to our school days and remember the pressure we all felt without the pandemic, so don’t make them try to achieve everything they’ve been set in school, from home. If you could do that, you wouldn’t need school in the first place. Don’t get hung up on it not looking like a normal school day – there’s no way it can do at the moment. As parents, we’re not teachers and experts. Even looking at my daughter’s year 8 maths makes my head spin! My role is to make sure she has somewhere safe and warm to work, that she has some vague routine, and then to say “well done” at the end of each day.5 Encourage your children to look to the futureI understand why parents, and students, are concerned about the future after all of this, especially those facing exams. My son is due to be off to university hopefully in September. Thankfully he’d worked hard up until this point but now he is a bit like: “Well, I might not even be doing my exams now so is there any point?” We need to keep reminding our children – and ourselves – that the future isn’t cancelled. This will end and things will go back to normal. Encourage them to keep looking forward and thinking about what is happening next. What subjects do they want to take? What are their plans for sixth form? What do they want to do at university? The future isn’t all out of the window, it’s very much just round the corner.Dr Kate Mason is a clinical psychologist specialising in children and young people at rootspsychologygroup. She understands through her job – and also firsthand as a mother – the impact that the continuing pandemic is having on the wellbeing of our children, and also the stress that it is causing parents. She recommends:1 Your relationship with your child is your number one priorityLast March, when we went into the first lockdown, my six-year-old just refused to do the home learning, so this time around I decided not to jeopardise my relationship with my son just to get him to do a bit of maths. I really do believe that in the grand scheme of their lifetime’s education, the younger ones especially will bounce back from this relatively short period of instability. Once I started thinking about it like that, I thought it is not worth the constant fallout. I emailed his teacher and said that I would get him to do what I could, but that a good, happy relationship with him is my first priority.2 Your frustration is coming from a good placeDuring that time when I was losing it over my inability to make my son do his maths and handwriting, I took a step back and asked myself: “Why am I so angry?” And I realised that I was angry because I was scared. I was scared for his education and that it was going to have a massive impact on his life. Understand that is where your upset and frustration is likely to be coming from – ultimately a good place, a place of love for your child.3 Keep calm … and make a visual timetableWhen children are calm, they are more able to learn. And kids feel calm, safe and contained – and then thrive – when there’s predictability and when they know what is coming next. Make a visual timetable with them peppered with lots of down time and fun stuff and most importantly something to look forward to at the end of the day. It’s vital to keep them looking forward. Treat yourself with calmness and self-compassion too. Remember, you are not their teacher. You can lead a horse to water, you can’t always make it drink. Nearly all children will listen to people who aren’t their immediate family, but they are designed to push your buttons. If this happens stop and take a break. Go and play a game, get their brains to calm down a bit – and only then come back and try again.The government is investing more than £400m to support disadvantaged children and young people with access to technology through the pandemic, including 1.3m laptops and tablets.The Department for Education has partnered with some of the UK’s leading mobile network operators to provide free data to disadvantaged families, further supporting remote education where it’s needed. Families will benefit from this additional data until July 2021.54,000 4G wireless routers have been provided, with free data for the academic year, to support disadvantaged children to access remote education and vital social care services.For more guidance on remote learning and support for mental health and wellbeing, visit: gov.ukcoronavirus-remote-learning or: gov.ukguidanceget-laptops-and-tablets-for-children-who-cannot-attend-school-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Here are the steps you need to take in order to navigate the new trading landscape and keep your business movingWhen Jem Skelding started his natural ingredients business Naissance in 2005, it was, he remembers, “just me, a laptop and a phone in a tiny spare room, using my credit card to buy stock”.Sixteen years on, the Neath-based firm has ballooned into a £25m turnover business employing more than 100 people. Trading with the European Union (EU) has buoyed much of that success today, roughly two-thirds of its sales come from the EU. Such is the popularity of its ethically-sourced oils in Europe that when Covid-19 hit Italy in early 2020, Naissance saw increased demand for its aloe vera gel and vegetable glycerine as Italian people started making their own handwashes and sanitisers – at a time when shop stock was low.The Brexit deal announced on Christmas Eve – and implemented on 1 January – means that firms such as Naissance can continue selling to EU customers without paying tariffs. However, the end of the UK transition period on 31 December also meant a number of changes to customs checks and paperwork that British businesses now need to familiarise themselves with. Being unprepared could trigger disruption and increased costs for businesses. As Skelding says: “If the paperwork isn’t correct, it could cause delays – meaning customers may not get their products when they need them.”Skelding’s advice to other SMEs is simple: “Don’t bury your head in the sand. If you’re struggling, there is help out there, such as at gov.uktransition, which has a useful checklist to make sure you’ve ticked all the boxes. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. Whenever there’s substantial change, there are opportunities too.”Find a customs agentAn estimated 250,000 businesses will be making customs declarations for the first time in 2021, which now need to be completed for any goods leaving or entering the UK via the EU. Customs declarations can be complex, so many firms usually appoint a customs agent to do the paperwork for them. You can find a list of approved agents at gov.ukguidancelist-of-customs-agents-and-fast-parcel-operators.Get an EORI numberTo move goods between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or the Isle of Man to any country overseas, businesses need an EORI number. Without an EORI, it’ll take HMRC much longer to clear your goods at the border, resulting in unwanted delays and possibly expensive storage costs. To transport goods between Great Britain and the EU, you’ll need an EORI with a “GB” prefix. And your EU partners will need an EORI with an “EU” prefix if they want to receive your goods (make sure you check they have this). Applying takes less than 10 minutes at gov.ukeori.Use government assistanceAfter a tough year when many businesses have undergone economic strain due to Covid-19, assistance is available so companies can adjust to the new processes, such as:Duty defermentPaying customs charges for each inidual consignment imported from the EU is time-consuming. Consider a duty deferment account, which enables firms to pay once a month via direct debit.Postponed accountingIf a business imports goods from the EU, it may need to pay import VAT on them. However, by using postponed accounting, businesses can avoid paying this at UK ports and airports, simply accounting for it on their next VAT return instead.Delayed paymentsFull border controls on goods entering the UK will not apply until 1 July 2021, with border checks staggered into three stages. If you’re not importing goods such as alcohol and tobacco, you can delay payments and defer submitting customs declarations for up to six months.The UK government has a Brexit checker tool, which provides information for businesses on how they can adapt to the new trading landscape at gov.uktransition.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

So why are prices tumbling, investors melting away and promises turning to dust? Every morning, when Nadeem Iqbal wakes up and walks into his living room, he has a view of a miraculous world first. A crisp oblong of crystal clear water now hangs in the air between two apartment buildings opposite his balcony, a liquid blue block suspended against the sky with the gravity-defying quality of a Magritte painting.This is the Sky Pool, the latest addition to the luxury residential enclave of Embassy Gardens in Nine Elms, south-west London – one absurdist step beyond the private cinema, indoor pool, gym and rooftop lounge bar. It was dismissed as a “crackers” PR stunt when the plan was unveiled by Irish developer Ballymore in 2015, a fantastical aquarium of captive high net worth iniduals for the rest of us to gawp at from far below. Surely it would never materialise. But last week the scaffolding was taken down to reveal a bright blue rectangle hovering against the leaden January skies, 10 storeys up in the air – just outside the 30-metre bomb blast seclusion zone around the new neighbouring US embassy.It has been billed as the world’s first swimming-pool bridge, a dazzling feat of acrylic engineering that will  the 14-metre gap between the two buildings and give residents the feeling of “floating through the air in central London”. But, although he lives in Embassy Gardens, Iqbal and his neighbours will never enjoy the thrill of going for an aerial dip. “We have a front-row seat of the Sky Pool,” he told me. “But the sad thing for us, living in the shared-ownership building, is that we will never have access to it. It’s only there for us to look at, just like the nice lobby, and all of the other facilities for the residents of the private blocks. Nobody expects these amenities for free, but we’re not even given the choice to pay for them.”For Iqbal to reach his two-bed flat – valued at £800,000, of which he owns a quarter and pays rent on the rest – he must walk past the grand, hotel-style main entrance to the complex, flanked by supercars with personalised number plates, to the back of the development, past construction fences and piles of rubble, to a small door located between ventilation grilles and a bin store, facing on to a railway line. “There’s a reason they’re called ‘poor doors’,” he said. “I grew up in South Africa, in a country that was racially segregated, but in London there is still really bad class segregation. We have a mortgage and we pay our rent, but every day we are made to feel inferior, like the have-nots of Nine Elms.”Stretching across a 230-hectare riverside swath from Vauxhall Cross to Battersea Power Station, straddling the boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth, the Vauxhall Nine Elms Battersea (VNEB) “opportunity area” has been trumpeted as the biggest regeneration project in Europe. When Boris Johnson, as mayor of London, launched the plans in 2012, he described it as “the greatest transformational story in the world’s greatest city”, the “final piece in the jigsaw” of central London. Once a place of low-slung warehouses and logistics depots, it is now a very visible presence on the London skyline. Competing stacks of luxury flats have sprouted along the river, replacing the elm trees that once stood here with a forest of concrete and cladding, a garish collage of mirrored glass, coloured plastic panels and fake bricks.With around 5,000 homes completed over the past five years, and a further 15,000 in the pipeline, it is now possible to get a sense of what kind of place is being created here, what effect the planning policies of the past decade will have in reality. The results so far are not encouraging. Roughly the size of Monaco, the new district has all the makings of a similarly exclusive fiefdom, an international investors’ playground where regular Londoners are pushed to the very edges, or cut out of the picture altogether.The capital is well used to high-rise, high-end totems by now, but VNEB takes the iniquities of the real estate-industrial complex to extremes. It is a place where penthouses with private chapels and running tracks loom above crumbling council estates across the railway line, where scores of flats lie empty, held by secretive shell companies in off-shore tax havens, and where the ision between absentee investors and owner-occupiers confined to poor doors could not be more stark. Dogged by allegations of cronyism and gerrymandering, it is the product of politicians in thrall to property developers, driven by a blind faith in the market – even when investors started to realise that they might have bought into a mirage.All along the railway line, running south-west from Vauxhall to Battersea, stand dense rows of apartment blocks similar to Iqbal’s – the “affordable” components of the luxury developments, shuffled to the back of the plots where land values are lowest, hidden from view along with the garages and service entrances. It is the same story across the road, where the angular blocks of the Riverlight development march along the Thames, along with a shared-ownership building that, for the last few years, has faced on to the noise and dust of the construction site for London’s new “super-sewer”. Brightly coloured vents and glass elevators reveal that this comes from the stable of architects Rogers Stirk Harbour, but the stylistic add-ons do little to disguise the reality of serried slabs of investment units garnished with fenced-off slivers of lawn – to which the affordable housing residents’ key fobs do not grant them access.Next to Embassy Gardens stands The Residence, by Bellway Homes, offering “elegant Manhattan-style living” in a series of brick towers jazzed up with gaudy red and yellow panels. A broad staircase leads up from the street to a podium garden, but a tall fence with an electric gate stops the second-class residents from getting in. “We are strategically excluded from being part of the community,” said Jason Owusu-Frimpong, who lives in part of The Residence facing the railway line, managed by housing association L\u0026ampQ. “We would happily pay for gym membership, if we were allowed to, but the management says it’s not for us. Meanwhile, the car park they told us was only for disabled use is now being sold off to wealthy international residents.”A few metres from his front door sit a pair of souped-up sports cars with Qatari number plates, parked ostentatiously on the pavement blocking an emergency exit, with a clutch of unpaid parking tickets flapping in the breeze beneath their windscreen wipers. The concierge is exasperated. “They are deliberately doing this,” said the man behind the desk in the private building’s lobby, to which Owusu-Frimpong and his neighbours are denied entry. “We have sent endless letters to the residents in question, but there’s nothing we can do about it. They come here from the Gulf for a few months of the year in holiday mode, race up and down the road, revving their engines late at night, then they ship their cars back home and never pay the fines.”VNEB is emerging as a place of two communities, with a bitter sense of ision nurtured by the very fabric of the neighbourhood. The exclusion has been designed into the buildings, streets and public spaces, and is enforced by the private management regimes that govern them. If it is an opportunity area, it has been an opportunity for trialling a new form of social apartheid on an industrial scale.Andrea Franzel lives in an apartment in the Chancery building of Embassy Gardens, a shared ownership block managed by the Peabody housing association. After months of navigating dense bureaucracy, as chair of the residents’ association, he secured some funding to buy a painting for the building’s bleak communal lobby, along with a mirror and a small console table. But, after three years, Peabody’s neighbourhood manager ruled that the table was a fire hazard, and had it removed. “It sounds like a small thing,” said Franzel, “but that little table was part of our community. We used to buy fresh flowers and leave things for each other. Now we have nothing.” Next door, the lobby for the private residents looks like a club-class lounge, teeming with expensive hazards, from the thick-pile carpets to marble coffee tables and inviting sofas. While these residents get packages delivered to their door, Franzel and his neighbours find their parcels often go missing, dumped in a pile downstairs. Since the pandemic struck, only the lift lobbies of the private blocks have been supplied with pumps of hand sanitiser.Residents on both sides have reported a host of issues with the buildings’ construction quality, from broken windows and doors to sinks that weren’t connected to waste pipes when they moved in, leading to serious internal leaks – an ongoing catalogue of calamities reported by a pair of Instagram accounts, @real_embassygardens and @ballymorehell. Private leaseholders are just as furious, leaving online reviews raging about everything from poor workmanship to extortionate service charges and “monopolistic” energy contracts.A spokesperson for Ballymore says: “We aim to create great places and positive experiences for everyone who lives on our sites. All residents at Embassy Gardens receive the same service in terms of estate management, security, fire command and control, general building safety and energy supply.” They stress that the affordable housing blocks are managed by Peabody and Optivo, which “had the option to choose which facilities they wanted to buy into for their residents”. As for the construction issues, they say: “We take any issues seriously and have two full-time aftercare managers on site, as well as a construction team completing the final residential building, so any issues can be dealt with swiftly.”Spokespeople for Peabody, Optivo and L\u0026ampQ all say that it is never their intention to make any community feel excluded, and that their policies do not include access to the private amenities in order to keep the service charges to a minimum. They insist that these terms were made clear to residents at the point of sale. As for being given the option to pay for additional services, such as gym membership, L\u0026ampQ adds that “following feedback from residents, we are reviewing this approach”.For Ravi Govindia, the Conservative leader of Wandsworth council since 2010, and key proponent of the area’s regeneration, it is a question of choice in a free market. “One shouldn’t create a deliberate ision without telling people what their money buys,” he said. “If people were led to believe they had access to everything, then in the small print it said otherwise, that would be wrong. But it’s up to people to make their choices.”When it comes to the criticism that the area is a ghost town, full of empty flats for foreign investors, not real homes that London needs, Govindia shrugs it off. “London is an international city,” he said. “It has always had people who don’t live in their home for 365 days a year. And the reality of overseas investment from off-plan sales has, in many cases, delivered these developments.”The district’s supposed popularity with foreign buyers has long been held up as a sign of success, with models of the VNEB developments a regular feature at the Mipim property trade fair in Cannes for the past decade. The primary purpose of the flats as safe deposit boxes, not homes, is evident when you look at the floor plans: this is “investment grade space”, with tiny rooms that just meet the minimum regulatory allowances, and emphasis placed on transport links and proximity to Westminster. So how attractive has this promised land actually proved to be for foreign buyers?Not very, the data suggests – despite everything that estate agents were doing to prove otherwise. In 2016, shortly after many of the projects launched off-plan sales, property analytics firm Propcision observed a strange phenomenon. Hundreds of luxury flats in Battersea and Nine Elms were continually being listed for sale on sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla, then taken down and immediately relisted. It was being done at such frequency across so many developments that it distorted the market across the whole area. “It gave the impression that there was not only a lot of activity,” said Propcision’s director, Michelle Ricci-Zak, “but that the average price in that area was going up – when actually we proved it was going down.”As off-plan customers began to suspect that they had bought into an illusion, they rushed to sell their speculative investments back to the developers, leading to a phenomenon known as “Nine Elms disease”, as up to £2m was knocked off the price of some penthouse flats. “Battersea panic stations” announced one headline. While the practice of immediate relisting has now been banned, and prices have mostly stabilised, there are still signs of a glut of too many similar high-end flats, with some investors trying to dispose of entire floors of towers in Vauxhall. “It seems some people took a big bite of the pie,” said Ricci-Zak, “and it didn’t taste so good.”It was the 180-metre-tall St George Wharf Tower, by the Berkeley Group, which began the craze for what has become a crowd of swollen shafts at this bend in the river. The tower was initially refused permission by Lambeth council, but in 2005 then-secretary of state John Prescott gave it the rubber stamp, despite warnings from his expert advisers that it “could set a precedent for the indiscriminate scattering of very tall buildings across London”. And so it did.As you exit Vauxhall station, the first of the priapic bunch to smack you in the face is the Damac Tower, formerly known as Aykon, designed by KPF architects and developed by Damac Properties – the same firm behind Donald Trump’s golf course resort in Dubai. It was billed as the very pinnacle of luxury living, “a global symbol of opulence” with a full-length pool on the 23rd floor and all interiors designed by Versace, offering buyers the chance to “live the complete Versace lifestyle, a fantasy turned into reality”. It now stands as a menacing Goliath on the edge of the Vauxhall gyratory, its lumpen blocks smothered with different cladding panels, as if several unrelated buildings have been chopped up and bolted back together without the instructions.Reaching 170 metres in height, the Damac Tower is part of the so-called “Vauxhall cluster”, a row of towers that now forms a motley wall on the skyline. Separated by roaring six-lane roads, the buildings are actually spaced too far apart to form any kind of cluster, standing with the awkward air of a socially distanced gathering of portly executives in ill-fitting suits.The cumulative effect of such a bloated outcrop was never properly considered. The 2012 planning framework for the area, drawn up by the Greater London Authority with input from Lambeth and Wandsworth, set a maximum height limit of 150 metres, with the taller St George Tower as “the pinnacle of the cluster”. But the plan was soon breached with the arrival of One Nine Elms, an apartment and hotel complex rising up to 200 metres, also designed by KPF. In a promotional video the architects argued that their site was at the geographic centre of the future crop, so it should therefore be the tallest, with lesser towers stepping up to it “in a sort of swirl”. The planners were convinced. “The man in the street might not understand how it works,” said Govindia, “but it is a well-tested principle that you organise tall buildings in a tight cluster, ascending to a peak.” KPF declined to comment, and their video has now been taken down.What this picturesque notion failed to foresee is that, once one 200-metre tower had been given permission, it would encourage others to follow, with the threat of expensive legal action if refused. It was a repeat of Prescott’s St George Tower fiasco, setting a precedent for neighbouring landowners to inflate their plans.A proposal for a pair of towers by Zaha Hadid Architects on the site of Vauxhall bus station, backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s wealthiest families through a Guernsey-listed company, was cranked up several stories to 185 metres, and given permission by secretary of state Robert Jenrick last year. A gargantuan trio of ziggurat-shaped towers reaching 200 metres is now well underway nearby, set to be the crowning feature of One Thames City, a complex of 12 blocks by Chinese developer R\u0026ampF Group on the site of the former New Covent Garden flower market (since relocated to a temporary shed down the road while a permanent home is developed). Designed by US firm SOM, it has been pitched as “a new benchmark in enduring luxury”, complete with a 30-metre pool and cigar bar, as well as a landscaped Chinese garden, described as “undoubtedly one of the most fascinating sceneries the Thames will behold”. The construction hoarding shows how the penthouse terraces will even come with their own private infinity pools looking out over the river – a vision recently adorned with a protest sticker with the words: “MAKE THE RICH PAY FOR COVID-19”.Not all Chinese buyers are impressed. “If you buy prime property in London,” said Ling Zhang, a Chinese investor who has acquired a handful of new-build apartments in the capital in recent years, “you want it to feel like London – not China. I also think there are far too many identical ‘luxury’ apartments being built in the same location for it to be a good investment. Chinese buyers are very concerned about location, and we mostly prefer north of the river, close to the universities. Many people send their children to London to study, then rent out the apartments when they graduate.” Henry Pryor, a prime property buying agent, is frank: “I’d rather buy a flat in Wuhan than Nine Elms today.”It appears that the world of international diplomacy might feel the same way. The US embassy was supposed to be the first of many missions to migrate across the river, and Nine Elms is still being promoted as “London’s new diplomatic quarter”. China was set to move its embassy here, as was the Netherlands, but both have backed out. The Dutch sold their plot to a hotel developer in 2019, while the Chinese have chosen the decorous surrounds of the old Royal Mint next to the Tower of London. Perhaps they shared Donald Trump’s assessment of Nine Elms, when he refused to cut the ribbon on the new embassy: a “lousy location”.The turbo-charged speculative development along the river has its origins in an unlikely place. It was the socialist mayor of London Ken Livingstone who first designated this part of the capital as one of his 28 “opportunity areas” in the 2004 London Plan, along with places such as King’s Cross, Elephant and Castle, the Greenwich peninsula and Paddington. The strategy was for a Robin Hood model of regeneration: a tidal wave of foreign investment would be actively encouraged, and tall buildings welcomed, in the belief that a large bounty could be creamed off for the public good. The target was for half of the housing to be affordable. If developers couldn’t meet this target, they would have to produce a financial viability assessment to prove why it wasn’t possible.Smoothing the path was Peter Bingle, a former flatmate of Govindia, and a Wandsworth councillor turned housebuilder lobbyist. His company, Terrapin Communications, has worked on behalf of a number of landowners and developers in the area, including Ballymore and Bellway, to help assist the passage of planning applications for hundreds of luxury homes. In 2018, a freedom of information request uncovered a cache of emails showing Bingle asking Govindia to intervene in decisions and circumvent council officials he believed were being obstructive to his clients. (There is no suggestion of wrongdoing.) In 1987, when he was chairman of the council’s property sales committee, Bingle stated: “My aim is to reduce the number of Council properties in Wandsworth from 35,000 to 20,000, and to make Battersea a Conservative constituency.” In critics’ eyes, similar ambitions are driving the development of Nine Elms, which will see a new ward boundary drawn around the luxury enclave.“Tory-led Wandsworth has always pioneered the neoliberal policies that created the housing crisis,” said Aydin Dikerdem, a Labour councillor for the Queenstown ward, in which much of the development is underway. “They launched the right to buy before it was national policy, and accomplished the mass privatisation and demolition of entire estates, as well as the outsourcing of services. What’s going on in Nine Elms and Battersea has nothing to do with maximising social good or creating mixed communities. It is pure social cleansing.”The depressing reality of what has happened here becomes all the more stark when you look across the river. Right opposite the power station stands Churchill Gardens, a vast postwar housing estate designed by distinguished architects Powell and Moya, built to house 5,000 people across a 12-hectare site, with several blocks now listed and around half still council-owned. Built by Westminster City Council, it was designed to accommodate a balanced cross-section of society, with the highest standards of housing for all – and not a segregated entrance in sight.“There was once a world where you could build riverside council homes,” said Dikerdem. “We’ve gone backwards since then. That’s why what has happened here is so upsetting. We are never again going to have all this abandoned industrial space on the river, which could have really transformed the lives of people in a borough in which thousands of people are statutorily homeless, and tons of professionals are spending all their income on private rent. It was a historic opportunity, but we’ve ended up with loads more luxury skyscrapers, which is not what the city needed.”• This article was amended on 2 February.

Some children in Wales are expected to return on the same date, while in England and Northern Ireland schools will reopen until 8 March at the earliest.Making her announcement to the Holyrood chamber, the first minister said: “To get the virus more under control, and so that we can prioritise every bit of headroom we create to get children back to school, we must all stay at home except for permitted, essential purposes for a bit longer – at least until the end of this month”.She added that teachers and other school and nursery staff would be offered at-home testing twice a week, along with all senior school pupils, and stressed that the phased return was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed.The announcement will put pressure on Downing Street to answer calls from Conservative MPs as to why England is operating on a slower timetable.Tory MP William Wragg, who chairs the constitutional affairs committee said the government should think again. “It’s welcome news to the millions of school children and their parents that the prime minister has confirmed that schools will be the first to open after lockdown,” he said.“But now that Scotland has indicated that schools are likely to return from 22 February, I’m wondering what’s holding us back from opening them up in England too?”Eight new Conservative MPs, including the former FCO minister Harriet Baldwin and former sports minister Tracey Crouch, have added their support to a call from lobby group UsForThem which demands the government publish a cost-benefit analysis on continued school closures. The demand has now been signed by 28 Tory MPs. Sturgeon also announced that Scotland would introduce a “managed quarantine” policy for people arriving directly into the country, “regardless of which country they have come from”.She added that this was a “much more comprehensive” system than proposed by the government in Westminster – where hotel quarantine will be imposed only on those returning from specific countries – and urged the UK government to adopt a similar approach.She added that there had been five cases of the South African variant in Scotland, all of which were linked to travel, with no evidence of community transmission.She also confirmed that 610,778 Scots had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, an increase of 34,881 from Monday’s figure, and said Scotland was on track to vaccinate all over-70s by mid-February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3631dc2562ba9472f6a3525dd47890743b38ade/0_24_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=599f017614d05d517c40b9550967c7cd","title":"manchester united v southampton premier league live","story":"63 min: Dan James gets in behind Moussa Djenepo and Kayne Ramsey and sends a cross into the penalty area from the left.

He’s coped as best as he can, all things considered, but is unlikely to forget his full league debut in a hurry.It’s as you were, as Adams’s goal is ruled out by the curtain-twitchers at Stockley Park. It takes a couple of minutes of fiddling about with the set square and protracter for them to decide Adams was offside by a whisker. It remains Manchester United 4-0 Southampton.The comeback is on! Che Adams scores from a tight angle after burrowing his way through the Manchester United penalty artea after a quickly taken free-kick. His low drive goes through the legs of Harry Maguire, past David De Gea and into the far corner.52 min: Now Van De Beek gets booked for a rash lunge on Stuart Armstrong. 51 min: Harry Maguire gets booked for a foul on Jack Stephens that leaves the Southampton defender in need of medical assitance. He’s OK.49 min: Will Manchester United take pity on their opposition, or try to emulate the nine goals without reply Leicester scored against Southampton in October 2019? The early indications in this second half suggest they are going to try to fill their boots. Martial and Van De Beek link up inside the Southampton area, before the Frenchman shoots wide from a tight angle.48 min: Fred seems to have moved into the spot previously occupied by Luke Shaw, with Donny van de Beek taking up position in the centre of midfield. 46 min: Play resumes, with two changes in personnel for the hosts. Anthony Martial and the lesser-spotted Donny van de Beek are on for Edinson Cavani and Luke Shaw. Premier League latest: In the evening’s remaining game, Crystal Palace lead Newcastle United 2-1 during the interval at St James’ Park. Jonjo Shelvey put Newcastle ahead in the second minute, but Crystal Palace have since turned things around courtesy of goals from Jairo Riedewald and Gary Cahill. Premier League: Sheffield United came from a goal down to win courttesy of a splendid second half performance at Bramall Lane. Premier League: David Luiz and Bernd Leno were sent off, as Wolves came from behind to make the most of Arsenal’s Arsenal-ness. Nick Ames was there ... Peep! Depleted by injury before a ball had been kicked, Southampton were reduc ed to 10 men after just 76 seconds when Alexandre Jankewitz saw red for a preposterously high lunge on Scott McTominay. United have since made hay, their goals coming from Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani, while Jan Bednarek also chipped in with an own goal.45 min: Bruno Fernandes shoots low and hard, hoping the defensive wall will jump and his effort will fizz underneath it. They oblige, but don’t jump high enough and his shot is blocked. 43 min: Graham Scott is on VAR duty tonight and decides to take pity on Southampton. He adjudges, incorrectly in my opinion, the Ramsey foul to have taken place just outside the penalty area, so Manchester United get a free-kick instead.Kayne Ramsey fouls Edinson Cavani on the edge of the penalty area and a merciless Mike Dean points to the spot. That was right on the line, which means it’s a spot-kick. Ouch! Edinson Cavani gets between two defenders in a crowded penalty area to power home a header from seven yards out. The cross came from Luke Shaw on the left. 37 min: Marcus Bean, former professional footballer and a regular guest on the ’s Football Weekly podcast, was sent off early on his debut for ... I think ... Queen’s Park Rangers as a youngster. At the time, he would later recall with the benefit of 20 odd years of hindsight and experience, he thought that was it ... that his career was over before it had even started. It wasn’t.Oh dear. Marcus Rashford whips the ball acrossd the face of the Southampton six-yard box. With Fred behind him waiting to poke it home, Jan Bednarek tries to intercept the delvidery but succeddes only in steering it into his own net. He beats the ground with his fist in frustration. A penny for the thoughts of young Alex Jankewicz, who was se4nty off after 76 seconds, as his team go three down in just over half an hour.33 min: Jack Stephens concedes another corner, stretching every sinew to head the ball over his own bar as Edinson Cavani lurked behind him hoping to get on the end of a whipped cross from the right.

James Ward-Prowse curls the ball towards the top right-hand corner, but David De Gea punches it out for a corner.United double their lead. After excellent work by Shaw down the inside left, Mason Greenwood pulls the ball back to Rashford about 14 yards from the Southampton goal.

Southampton are seriously under the cosh.13 min: In the absence of Jankewitz, Southampton have pulled Danny Ings back into midfield and left Che Adams on his own up front. As United go to play the ball out from the back, he tries to press but is told to desist by his manager, Ralph Hasenhuttl, who is probably aware of the futility of the exercise.12 min: The ball’s played down the left flank from deep for Luke Shaw to chase. It skids off the surface and out of play for a goal kick. 10 min: With their visitors down to 10 men, Manchester United are dominating as much as you might expect but have yet to create anything resembling a decent scoring opportunity.6 min: Alex Jankewitz went in high on McTominay with that preposterous challenge, so high that he left two stud marks down the length of the Manchester United midfielder’s inner thigh. What on earth was he thinking?!?!?! Fred aims for the top right-hand corner from distance but sends the ball high and wide.4 min: Down to 10 men after 79 seconds, Southampton are in for a very, very long night. Marcus Rashford cuts inside from the left and eschews a shooting opportunity, choosing instead to cut the ball back to Bruno Fernandes near the penalty spot. Southampton clear.Mike Dean brandishes red in the direction of Southampton’s midfielder, who is making his first start for Saints tonight. His game is over - he went over the ball and clattered studs-up into the inner thigh of Scott McTominay and now he’s heading for the dressing-room. 2 min: Severely depleted because of injury, Southampton have four teenagers on their bench tonight, three of whom have yet to make their first team debuts.1 min: Southampton get the ball rolling, their players wearing navy shirts, shorts and socks. Manchester United’s representatives wear their customary home kit of red shirts, white shorts and black socks.Not long now: It’s another wet, rainy night in Manchester and the teams are out on the pitch ahead of kick-off. Southampton were first out of the tunnel, followed by their hosts, led by Harry Maguire with Edinson Cavani bringing up the rear. The last of the pre-match niceties are under way.Premier League: Joao Moutinho won the points for Wolves with a long range screamer, as the hosts came from behind to beat nine-man Arsenal.Premier League: Sheffield United have come from behind to beat West Brom by the odd goal of three in a critical relegation dogfight at Bramall Lane. Matt Phillips put the visitors ahead, but second half goals from Jayden Bogle and Billy Sharp won all three points for the Blades. Ole Gunnar Solskjær makes just one change to the side that drew against Arsenal over the weekend, but it’s quite a significant one. Paul Pogba is droppede to the bench, with Mason Greenwood taking his place.Southampton make four changes to the side that lost against Aston Villa. Kayne Ramsey and Alex Jankewitz make their first Premier League starts, while Moussa Djenepo and Che Adams also come into the side. Nathan Redmond starts on the bench tonight, while Theo Walcott, Oriel Romeu and Ibrahim Diallo are all injured.Referee: Mike DeanAssistants: Ian Hussin and Darren CannFourth official: Lee MasonVAR: Graham ScottAssistant VAR: Stephen ChildScott McTominay is available for selection for Manchester United despite being forced off the field during their draw against Arsenal following a 37-minute long interstinal roller-coaster ride that must have seemed like an eternity for the poor sod. With just three days between matches, Ole Gunnar SOlskjær may freshen up his side. Eric Bailly, Anthony Martial and Nemanja Matic may be in line for recalls.By comparison, Southampton are decimated by injuries, with Michael Obafemi, William Smallbone, Nathan Tella and Mohammed Salisu all sidelined, while Jannik Westergaard, Theo Walcott, Ibrahima Diallo and Kyle Walker-Peters are also major doubts. Oriel Romeu is likely to be available for selection after recovering from the knock he picked up against Villa. A late Deadline Day arrival on loan from Liverpool, Takumi Minamino is unavailable for selection tonight.Old Trafford is the venue for tonight’s set-to between Manchester United and Southampton. Second in the table, four points behind leaders Manchester City and with one game more under their belt, United could certainly do with a win after dropping five of the last six points available.On a run of three consecutive defeats, Southampton also need to steady the ship, but showed signs of a return to form against Aston Villa over the weekend in a game they were desperately unlucky to lose. Kick off at Old Trafford is at the ungodly hour of 8.15pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.

Therefore I’m left with little option but to log off. Here’s Barry’s Manchester United v Southampton liveblog. Bye!Nick Ames has filed his match report from Molineux:When confidence is shot, a leg-up can change everything. That was the case for Wolves, who were being overrun by Arsenal before seeing events swing dramatically in their favour just before half-time. They were behind to Nicolas Pépé’s 32nd-minute goal and lucky not to be in even greater distress, but then came the decision that enabled their first win in nine league games. Rúben Neves’ penalty was perfectly justifiable but the red card David Luiz received for its concession will dominate the analysis.Wolves promptly took the points with a glorious long-range screamer from João Moutinho and Arsenal despaired further when Bernd Leno was also dismissed 18 minutes from time. It became the worst of nights for Mikel Arteta when, for half of the game, his team had shown fresh evidence that their improvement is no fluke.Much more here:Other stories worth your attention from the world of football today:Still want more? Barry Glendenning is poised to sprinkle his magic all over Manchester United v Southampton:Rio Ferdinand on the David Luiz sending-off: “What we’ve learned is that you’re better off going in and just smashing the striker, and you’ll probably get a booking.” We should put this to bed, I think. I do think it should have been a penalty, I think it’s unacceptable that it was also a red card, and that people should be making this kind of inference as a result. Some fresh guidance to the officials is probably in order.90+6 mins: Boly wins the header, the ball is thumped back upfield, and the referee blows his whistle! Wolves, outplayed for most of the first half, snaffle the points!90+6 mins: Arsenal win a free-kick, 15 yards into the Wolves half. The keeper comes up to take it ...90+4 mins: Chance for a third! Silva’s run draws a couple of defenders and Neto passes to the unmarked Vitinha to his left, but he shoots wide of the near post.90+2 mins: FINAL SCORE! Sheffield United 2-1 West Brom! The Blades pocket three massive points. They’re still a long old way from safety, but they’ve now won three out of five and who knows?90+1 mins: There will be five minutes of stoppage time. Wolves take off Willian Jose, who has had a reasonable game and of course made the excellent run that led to the match-transforming penaltyred card thing, and bring on Fabio Silva.90 mins: Arsenal have a chance! Bellerin pulls back to Aubameyang, whose shot hits Boly. It rebounds to Saka, whose shot hits Coady, and Wolves clear.88 mins: Wolves are keeping the ball for another while. They’re in absolutely no hurry, have a two-man advantage, and should pretty much be able to pass away the five minutes or so standing between them and victory.87 mins: The game in Sheffield is a couple of minutes ahead of this one, and just entering stoppage time. There’ll be three minutes of it, and Sheffield United are on their way to three massive points.85 mins: Traore crosses from the right, and in the middle Jose miscues his header and the ball bounces harmlessly wide.83 mins: Wolves keep the ball for a while. And then another while. “So ... just to recap ... Arsenal’s hit the post twice, scored a beauty, had a disallowed goal, conceded two goals, and had two people sent off,” writes Chuck. “Is that right? I’ve kind of lost track.” That’s just about it (actually they hit the post once, and the bar once).79 mins: “A player will be sent off soon, show dissent against the decision, be recalled on review by VAR but get a yellow for the foul, and then get a second yellow for the earlier dissent,” predicts Gary Naylor. Just as long as I’m watching when it happens. Vitinha dances through the area before trying to catch Runarsson out at the near post, and failing.77 mins: Runar son of Runar is tested for the first time by Neto’s drive from an unpromising angle, and saves well enough.74 mins: That’s a really odd moment. Leno got to the ball well before Traore. He had time. Unless the ball hit something on the pitch and suddenly turned left, it’s hard to explain. Arsenal bring their substitute goalkeeper, the fabulously named Runar Runarsson, on for Partey.72 mins: Leno races from his area to intercept Nelson Semedo’s through-ball before Traore can reach it, but instead of heading it, or kicking it, or using any other part of his body to dispose of it, he misjudges the bounce, it hits his right arm, and he’s off!71 mins: GOAL! Sheffield United 2-1 West Brom! A cross from the right hits a defender and drops to Billy Sharp, eight yards from goal, who gobbles up the chance!69 mins: Partey approaches the area before blasting a shot into Coady’s leg. The ball spins to Saka, who goes past Kilman with joyful ease but then goes down a little over-easily as he approaches the area, and the referee is not convinced.66 mins: Nelson Semedo plays the ball to Jose and keeps running, Jose backheels it into his path, and at that point a defender gets in the way of what would have been an excellent goal.64 mins: We should leave the penaltyred card incident behind us, I suppose. Before we do so, a couple of further posers for our referees: “Thinking about the sending off - the rule therefore means that anyone giving away a penalty for holding or tugging a shirt in the box (from a corner for example) has to be sent off as they are not playing the ball,” writes Steve Ditchburn in Malta. Stupid as this is, it’s no more stupid than the actual thing that actually happened in this actual match. I also think this is a reasonable question from Adrian Clarke:62 mins: Xhaka pushes Podence over, and gets booked. Podence then goes off, with Vitinha coming on. “Bernd Leno wasn’t attempting to play the ball when Willian Jose kicked his own knee and fell over, either,” notes Michael Keegan. “Why wasn’t he sent off too?”60 mins: Aubameyang has come on, replacing Pepe.59 mins: Arsenal are still doing some decent attacking, despite their numerical disadvantage. Bellerin’s cross is turned behind, and then Partey knocks Nelson Semedo over on his way to meeting the corner.54 mins: GOAL! Sheffield United 1-1 West Brom! The ball bounces to Jayden Bogle inside the area and he smashes it in at the near post! 52 mins: “I am not sure if you’re an Arsenal fan (it’s coming across as such),” writes Ricky Gill. “It is a clear penalty. Luiz gets himself in a terrible position and inadvertently impedes the running motion of Jose. He probably did not intend on making contact there but he doesn’t do himself any favours. After that, the referee doesn’t have a choice but to send him off as he was the last man. Its unlucky but this is far from a bad decision.”I am by no means an Arsenal fan. My primary issue is with the idea of classifying that completely accidental contact as a straight red card because there was no attempt to play the ball. To my mind it is unacceptable that people who interpret the law in that way exist, let alone that those people are then issued with whistles and told to officiate top-flight matches. 50 mins: There’s no arguing with that. A stunning hit. Phenomenal. Cowabunga! Joao Moutinho, fully 30 yards out, sends an absolute screamer off the post and into the net!47 mins: Neves is booked for bringing Cedric down as Arsenal attempt to break.46 mins: Both games have restarted. Arsenal have brought Gabriel on for Lacazette to bolster their defence.“Are you having a laugh?” asks Robert Andrews. “He fouls the man in the box, denies a clear goalscoring opportunity. Straight red. Stonewall Penalty all day, every day. Doesn’t matter a wit his intention.” Laugh? I’m genuinely furious, particularly because watching David Luiz get sent off is normally so much fun. The purpose of that law is to punish players who cynically and deliberately poleaxe a player before they can score. It’s not to brandish at red cards at people who didn’t do anything deliberate whatsoever. Really, referees, grow the hell up.Peter Walton, BT Sport’s in-house refereeing expert, says Craig Pawson had no choice but to send David Luiz off, because he wasn’t attempting to play the ball when Willian Jose kicked his knee and fell over. If that is genuinely how referees are reading the laws, it’s absolutely unacceptable and the laws need to be immediately reworded to make it less possible to draw cretinous conclusions from them.No foul can be given unless a referee considers an offence to have been committed “in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force”. So which was that? We can rule out excessive force and the recklessness. Was it careless? I suppose maybe, at a push, if you’re really picky. I’m not sure, according to the laws of the game, it’s even a penalty. I don’t understand how that red card is remotely justifiable. There was no challenge. Of course David Luiz didn’t attempt to play the ball, he wasn’t attempting anything, except to catch up with the guy streaking away in front of him.Ruben Neves crashes his penalty into the top right corner of the net, and having been second best for much of the match Wolves go into the break on level terms and a man up!Podence plays a fine ball through to Willian Jose, who catches David Luiz with his heel as he runs through and goes over. The referee gives the penalty, and David Luiz is sent off for running!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0551952ee534dafa330deb27149c64729e39e63/0_239_3259_1955/master/3259.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=cc763d247ec2979088190bdd21b0b134","title":"conversations with kids about coronavirus podcast","story":"Children across the UK talk about how the pandemic has affected their livesAnushka Asthana talks to children across the country about what life has been like under lockdown.

School was full of rumours, he tells Anushka, that Covid made you sick and gave you warts. Whenever you went to the toilet, you would hear Happy Birthday being sung at the sinks. Aryan is at home again, which means “loads of sheets of papers to print off” for home schooling, and he says he can’t wait to see his friends again. For 14-year old Becca in Glasgow, the first wave led to her mum being laid off from her job. It meant things were “a little bit harder but we found a way”. She says that if her Mum found it tough looking after her and her three brothers, she didn’t show it. Rory, 18, has just completed his first term at Durham University. He got Covid while he was there and said the experience was very isolating. He says he found returning to Northern Ireland a huge relief. He worries the pandemic has had a big impact on the mental health of people his age.  Anushka also talks to Dr Polly Waite, a clinical psychologist, who discusses the Co-Space study, which has followed 12,000 families during the pandemic to look at how they are coping and what parents can do to help support their children’s mental health.

So I am really pleased we are now in a position to enable every MP and staff member the chance of a test, to help stop this awful virus in its tracks.“Almost overnight we have turned a large committee room in Portcullis House into a sanitised testing centre with clinical assistants working every weekday to keep safe those who have to be here.”Addressing the Commons on Tuesday, Hancock, who referenced the fact that about one in three people with coronavirus do not display symptoms but can still pass it on, said: “Mr Speaker, across the whole country we’re expanding workplace testing, including here in parliament itself.“And this morning, you and I together visited the new Covid testing site here in parliament which offers all of those who work here – peers, MPs and staff – the chance to get tested. I took a test this morning, thankfully negative. It’s quick and easy and you get the result back fast. And I encourage colleagues who have to be here in person to sign up and do the same.”The tests in parliament are booked by appointment, with those wanting to use them having to ensure they have no coronavirus symptoms and have their mobile phone with them to register the test on the government’s website. In addition, they should not have had anything to eat or drink half an hour before the test, or have tested positive for Covid in the last 90 days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c996b9ec9969e373532b4c3605e0e9ef2eecb0c/0_316_3340_2003/master/3340.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=383c30f66f23a52663e72f4339cb0a7d","title":"travel photographer of the year 2020 in pictures","story":"From majestic landscapes, intimate animal portraits and intriguing night-time views beneath the ocean’s surface, to glimpses of cultures across the world, the winning images from Travel Photographer of the Year 2020 present a view of life on our planet at a time in which travel has been difficult or impossible The winning images will go on display in Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross, London, in May and in other TPOTY exhibitions, including Chester Cathedral, during 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9701ed949dc27794ba4b2ef029b17a177d59a837/0_0_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5fccf944eefdedf59f85a1946aad644f","title":"lost on the frontline covid nurse coronavirus","story":"Yolanda Coar was 40 when she died of Covid-19 in August 2020 in Augusta, Georgia.

The tiny settlement of about 100 inhabitants had been prioritised because of its older population, many of whom belong to the White River First Nation.Onboard were the casino executive Rod Baker and his wife, the actor Ekaterina Baker, who had broken quarantine and flown to Beaver Creek for the sole purpose of receiving doses of the Moderna vaccine.Over the next few hours, the couple travelled into town, posed as local motel employees, received their shots and then escaped as quickly as they had arrived.As Canada struggles with vaccine shortages and delays, the Bakers’ deception has been met with scorn and disbelief. The incident – in which a wealthy white couple received treatment intended for the most vulnerable members of an Indigenous community – has cast a spotlight on the stark isions of class and race that cut across the country.“They saw the most vulnerable people within the community on full display and continued on to get the shot,” said Janet Vander Meer of the White River First Nation. “That’s what disgusts me.”When their chartered plane touched down in Beaver Creek, the Bakers told airport staff they were heading north to Dawson City, but had been forced by fog to land. They would wait in Beaver Creek until the weather improved, they said.While the pilot waited, the couple caught a ride towards the town’s main drag: a handful of hotels, gas stations and a tourist information centre, hemmed in by black spruce trees and rolling boreal forest.“It’s really been a bit of a ghost town. And so vaccination day was meant to be a small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel for people,” said Vander Meer, who worked with territorial officials to help set up the vaccination event. “The clinic and the vaccine coming was a reason for us to celebrate.”Since early January, the Yukon government has used two mobile vaccination teams to target vulnerable and hard-to-reach areas such as Beaver Creek. The teams – Balto and Togo – are named after two famous sled dogs, in a nod to the region’s harsh conditions.It is unclear how the Bakers knew about the team’s visit to Beaver Creek – nearly 3,000km (1,900 miles) from their luxury condominium in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia.As head of Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, which runs racetracks and casinos across the country, Rod Baker made a profit of C$45.9m ($35.7m) in stock options exercised over the past 13 months, according to the Globe and Mail. He resigned from his role after he was charged by Yukon officials. Ekaterina has appeared in a number of films, including Chick Fight and Fatman.After Bakers allegedly asked for a ride to the airport, members of the vaccine team grew suspicious. Calls to local motels confirmed that neither were employees. The team then contacted Yukon’s law enforcement officials.In Beaver Creek, where residents found out about the couple’s ploy from local reporters, not the government, the immediate response was one of panic: thanks to its isolation, the community had not seen any confirmed cases of the virus, but age and pre-existing health conditions meant that its population was firmly in the demographic most vulnerable to Covid-19.“I have never seen anybody charter flights to Beaver Creek,” said Quanah Giuseppe Vander Meer, another member of White River First Nation. “I’ve lived there most of my life and it scared me hearing about them being able to sneak in like that.”Janet Vander Meer, who had spent months working out the logistics of the vaccine delivery, went home and cried.“I felt as if I had let my community down,” she said. “The mental toll that these people put on me and my family, making me feel like I did something wrong – that’s not acceptable. It’s something l’m still grappling with.”Janet Vander Meeer is still furious to think that before receiving their own vaccinations, the Bakers would have seen both her mother – who is in palliative care and moves with a walker – as well as an 88-year-old Beaver Creek resident waiting in line for the vaccine.“You’d think at that point, one of them would say ‘OK, honey, let’s get back to our chartered plane.’ But no – they got their shot,” she said.News of the Bakers’ trip reached the wider world when local papers reported that the couple had been fined for breaching lockdown rules. And when the size of the fine – C$2,300 ($1,800) – was compared with the couple’s wealth, the outrage only grew.“There is nothing more un-Canadian than going to another jurisdiction to jump the line because you have the means to do so,” the British Columbia premier, John Horgan, told reporters.Last week, Yukon officials announced the tickets had been stayed and the Bakers were summoned to appear in court, where they will face charges for failing to self-isolate for 14 days and failing to act in a manner consistent with their declarations upon arriving in the Yukon. If convicted, they could face up to six months in jail. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are also investigating. The Bakers have not commented publicly since the charges were filed.Alongside indignation over the Bakers’ behaviour, the saga has highlighted the deeply rooted racial inequities of Canada’s healthcare system: many remote Indigenous communities lack sufficient resources to care for residents and are especially vulnerable to outside infection during the pandemic.“We know that this is a system that has failed Indigenous peoples … and treated Indigenous peoples as second-class citizens,” said Marc Miller, Indigenous services minister, to a conference on racism in the healthcare system last week.Janet Vander Meer said her efforts remained fixed on White River’s safety – and ensuring nothing like this happened again.“I don’t care what they were doing or thinking when they came up here. I don’t have time for that,” she said. “Right now, I need to focus on getting the community ready to get the second dose of the vaccine safely. Because that’s what matters most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c34740492c90ffd5c4ac76be223954cd276e5e/0_324_2575_1546/master/2575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bcfe5b2f160a21376cc14cda118eab5","title":"bristol and liverpool to get community covid testing for variants","story":"Cases show same mutation in both original and Kent strains as South African incarnationCommunity Covid testing is to be expanded in two more cities to stem the spread of the South African variant of the coronavirus, as it emerged that the Kent variant was developing some of the same mutations.In a sequence of events illustrating the ever-changing battle faced by ministers in curbing the spread of variants that could be more resistant to vaccines, Matt Hancock used a Commons statement to announce the expansion of efforts to combat a South African strain of coronavirus, feared to be more resistant to existing vaccines.On Monday, the government urged people in eight areas of England to stay at home in almost all circumstances and to expect possible tests after cases of the variant were found in those locations.On Tuesday, Hancock, the health secretary, said there had been 11 cases of “mutations of concern” in Bristol and 32 in Liverpool, and that both cities had been added to areas that will see large amounts of community testing.“As with the variant first identified here in the UK, there is currently no evidence to suggest it is any more severe but we have to come down on it hard,” Hancock told MPs. “Our mission must be to stop its spread all together and break those chains of transmission.”But Public Health England (PHE) said later that the cases in Bristol and Liverpool were in fact previous incarnations of the virus with a mutation known as E484K, previously seen in the South African variant, and in one originating in Brazil.This mutation, as well as one known as K417N and also seen in the South African virus variant, are thought to help the variant evade the body’s immune response, and could affect how well vaccines protect against Covid.PHE said the 32 Liverpool cases showed the original pandemic variant, with the E484K mutation, while in Bristol this mutation had occurred in the UK-originating Kent strain.Both the South African variant and Kent variant contain a mutation called N501Y, which is believed to make the virus more contagious.Experts said the appearance of the E484K mutation in different variants is not a surprise, but is nonetheless a concern. “It shows that the virus is very likely to be adapting to our immune response,” said Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.One concern is whether current Covid vaccines will prove less effective against new variants.While the E484K mutation could be contributing to the reduced efficacy of vaccines against the South Africa variant, it is unclear if the mutation could also explain the slightly lower efficacy of the Novavax jab towards the Kent variant, not least as very few cases of the latter have been found to contain the E484K mutation.Prof Paul Heath, the principal investigator of the UK arm of the Novavax vaccine trials, added the difference in vaccine efficacy between the UK variants was very small.“At this period in time I don’t think we can say there is a difference,” he said. “All we are in a position to say is that the efficacy of the vaccine is very high.”Hancock told the Commons that the government was working with pharmaceutical firms to see if vaccines needed to be adapted to deal with the variants, and “how they can be brought to use on the frontline as quickly and safely as possible”.Responding for Labour, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, sought clarity on when tougher quarantine measures for overseas arrivals would be brought in, and called for more financial help so people will self-isolate if asked.“We are fighting this virus with one hand tied behind our back, asking the low paid to go hungry in order not to spread the virus,” he said. “Transmission chains won’t be broken without decent sick pay and isolation support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b81fee755da46b5084d939eab5857ba7548a9a2/0_125_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1d2405e491d39848dadf2078df6e378b","title":"coronavirus

However, she went on to say she was “optimistic” that there could be some easing from the beginning of March.Sturgeon told MSPs that, subject to a final review in a fortnight, there would be a full-time return to early learning and childcare settings as well as a full-time return for primary school pupils in years one, two and three, from 22 February.There will also be a very limited return for senior pupils to allow in-school practical work necessary for the completion of national qualification courses.Sturgeon added that teachers and other school and nursery staff would be offered at-home testing twice a week, along with all senior school pupils, and stressed that the phased return was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed.The announcement will put pressure on the UK government to answer calls from Conservative MPs as to why England is operating on a slower timetable.Read the full story here.Saudi Arabia has suspended entry from 20 countries in a bid to curb a surge in coronavirus infections, AP reports.The interior ministry announced the “temporary suspension” would be effective from 9pm on Wednesday, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.The ban applies to neighbouring Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and in the wider region, to Lebanon and Turkey. In Europe, it extends to the UK, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland. Elsewhere, it applies to the US, Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Japan and South Africa.Saudi citizens, as well as diplomats and health workers coming from those countries, will be allowed to enter the kingdom “in accordance with the precautionary measures”, it added.The announcement comes after the Saudi health minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah warned on Sunday that new coronavirus restrictions could be imposed if citizens and residents do not comply with health restrictions.The country has reported more than 368,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 6,400 deaths, the highest among Gulf Arab states.Daily infections dipped below 100 in early January, from a peak of nearly 5,000 last June. However, new daily infections have tripled since then, with 310 cases reported by the health ministry on Tuesday.Saudi Arabia launched its coronavirus vaccination campaign on 17 December after receiving the first shipment of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.The health ministry said the programme would roll out in three phases, starting with people over 65 and those with chronic ailments, or who are at high risk of infection.But last month the ministry said it was forced to slow the rollout due to a delay in vaccine deliveries.A single dose of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine provides sustained protection against Covid-19 for at least three months and cuts transmission of the virus by two-thirds, according to research that appears to support the UK’s decision to delay booster shots.The findings are preliminary, and still under review at The Lancet, but if they stand up to scientific scrutiny would reassure public health officials that prioritising more vulnerable people for a first shot of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is a sound strategy.The French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday all French people who are willing to be vaccinated will be offered a vaccine by the end of summer.In an interview with TF1 television he also said that because the virus is evolving quickly, pharmaceutical companies need to start preparing now for vaccines that will be needed this winter and early next year.Macron added that in the coming weeks, by the end of February through to early March, production of Covid-19 vaccines in France will start and there would eventually be four different production centres.He also said that vaccines must be supplied to poorer developing countries, notably Africa and Latin America.We must think about developing countries because if we do not vaccinate there too, the virus will circulate there and mutate, and it will strike unjustly the poorest people, and then the virus will come back to our countries.Macron said the major constraint today was not intellectual property but production capacity and that companies who invented the vaccines must link up with those who can help them boost output, while respecting intellectual property rights.He added that the EU so far had ordered a supply of about 2.4 billion vaccines. Some member states have sharply criticised the slow rollout of vaccination programmes within the bloc.Asked about Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, Macron said that a few weeks ago he had sent a scientific mission to Russia and the exchanges were positive, and that there had been reports indicating the shot was effective against Covid-19.“But in order to approve a vaccine, a request to market it must first be made. The minute a request is made, European and national authorities will study this independently and, depending on the results, approve it or not. It is not a political decision but a scientific decision,” he said.The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said on Tuesday that most of the lockdown measures in the Netherlands, many of which have been in place since October, will remain in place for weeks due to fears over a surge in cases as a result of new coronavirus variants.Rutte’s government, which is currently serving in a demissionary capacity since he resigned on 15 January, is still weighing whether to continue an evening curfew that has triggered rioting in some cities beyond next week, the prime minister told a press briefing.The government announced earlier this week that primary schools and daycares will reopen on 8 February, adding that it is also looking at possibly reopening secondary schools but that will not happen before March.“It is inescapable to extend the current lockdown almost entirely until at least March 2,” Rutte said, despite falling case numbers in the Netherlands.“A third wave is inevitably coming our way,” he said, pointing to new virus strains which are more infectious.The Netherlands has been in what the government calls a strict lockdown since mid-December and last month imposed a curfew, the country’s first since World War Two, which sparked riots.But this week’s decline “would have been greater without the new variants of the virus that have entered the Netherlands, especially the British variant”, the RIVM said in a statement.The health minister Hugo de Jonge said on Monday that half of the cases were being caused by the new variant as of 26 January, up from around a third the week before. The government fears it may cause a new wave ahead of 17 March elections.Portugal, currently feeling the full force of its third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, has appealed for international help to relieve overwhelmed hospital staff, AFP reports.The prime minister Antonio Costa has acknowledged that the nation’s hospitals are under “gigantic pressure”. The government acted after the country’s 24-hour death toll passed the 300-mark and television stations broadcast pictures of ambulances queueing up outside Lisbon’s largest hospital.Costa’s administration confirmed late on Monday it had accepted an offer of help from Germany, after an announcement from Berlin that they were sending medics, 150 field hospital beds and respiratory machines.Portugal is “in a particularly dramatic situation,” said the German defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. “In such times, solidarity in Europe is indispensable,” she added.The Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz said over the weekend that they were willing to take patients into their intensive care units, and the western Spanish region of ExtraMadura, which borders Portugal, offered its help Tuesday.And the EU’s crisis commissioner Janez Lenarcic said in a tweet that they were “closely following the critical situation” in Portugal and stood ready to help if requested.Leaving aside low-populated micro-states, Portugal is the country that has been hardest hit by the coronavirus over the pasts two weeks in terms of the death rate. Over the past week, the country of 10 million inhabitants recorded 20 deaths a day per 100,000 inhabitants. The death toll stands at nearly 13,000, but more than 5,500 of them died in January.Lisbon’s Santa Maria hospital, one of the two largest in the country, took in another 333 patients on Tuesday out of a total of 350 beds allocated for Covid-19 sufferers. But there are only six places free in the intensive care unit.Another hospital serving the Amadora and Sintra districts in the suburbs of the capital, has had to tend with a loss of pressure in its crucial oxygen distribution system, which has struggled with the surge in demand.The authorities are nevertheless reporting signs that the worst might be over. On Tuesday, the country’s health directorate reported less than 6,000 new cases for the second day running, which has not happened since 5 January.At the same time, the total number of people hospitalised with coronavirus, fell to 6,775, of whom 852 were in intensive care.“Portugal is now the worst country in the world,” virologist Pedro Simas of Lisbon’s Institute of Molecular Medicine told AFP. “But we are already seeing signs of improvement.”The third wave hit the country with the daily infection still too high from the second wave, he added. But he and other experts cited in the local media believe that the worst is over in certain regions - and that the Lisbon region’s daily infection rate should also soon peak.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has said on that most of the lockdown measures in the Netherlands, many of which have been in place since October, will remain in place for weeks due to fears over a surge in cases as a result of variant strains.Rutte’s government is still weighing whether to continue an evening curfew that has triggered rioting in some Dutch cities beyond next week, the prime minister told a press briefing.The government announced earlier this week that primary schools and daycares will reopen on 8 February, adding that it is also looking at possibly reopening secondary schools but that will not happen before March, Reuters reports.“It is inescapable to extend the current lockdown almost entirely until at least March 2,” Rutte said, despite falling case numbers in the Netherlands. “A third wave is inevitably coming our way,” he said, pointing to new virus strains which are more infectious.The Netherlands has been in what the government calls a strict lockdown since mid-December and last month imposed a curfew, the country’s first since World War Two.The US is to launch a new program shipping coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies starting next week in an effort to increase Americans’ access to shots, president Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients, said, Reuters reports.The program will launch on 11 February and make 1 million doses available to 6,500 stores, according to Zients. As supply grows, the program could expand to as many as 40,000 stores, he said.Biden said last month that the Covid-19 vaccine rollout has been a “dismal failure” so far and vowed to boost the speed at which shots are given to Americans, with a focus on ensuring equitable access regardless of geography, race, or ethnicity.The federal government will distribute a million vaccine doses to the 6,500 stores next week, Zients said, adding that the amount will grow over time. That is in addition to 10.5 million doses that the federal government plans to ship weekly to states and territories for the next three weeks, he added.“This will provide more sites for people to get vaccinated in their communities,” Zients said, adding that supply constraints will limit the program in its early days.Exports of Swiss cheeses hit record highs in 2020, as Covid-induced lockdowns spurred increased interest in home cooking, the Switzerland Cheese Marketing organisation has said.The organisation said in a statement:Despite the difficult economic conditions linked to the coronavirus pandemic, the export levels seen in 2019, a record year, were once again surpassed.Last year, Switzerland exported over 77,100 tonnes of cheese, up 1.6 percent from 2019. Income from the exports swelled nearly four percent to almost 640 million euros, Switzerland Cheese Marketing said.Exports of ready-to-use fondue cheese saw the biggest jump of 4.9 percent. “The closure of restaurants, people working from home, but also the restrictions on leisure activities have forced us to spend more time at home,” the organisation’s spokeswoman Christa Wettstein told AFP in an email.Cheese consumption had been bolstered by the fact that time spent around the table had become one of few occasions where “sharing and conviviality” remained possible, she pointed out.Daily infections and deaths from Covid in Portugal have retreated further from last week’s records, with fewer patients in intensive care which has eased pressure on overstretched hospitals, Reuters reports.Deaths rose by 260 to 13,017, below Monday’s increase of 275 and down from an all-time high of 303 reported on Thursday and Sunday, data from the health authority DGS showed.Portugal reported close to half of all its Covid deaths last month, highlighting an acceleration in cases that has prompted several European nations to offer help.New infections totalled 5,540 after 5,805 the previous day, in a sharp slowdown from 16,432 last Thursday. The number of Covid patients on hospitals wards and in intensive care units dropped, the latter by 13 to 852.Mexico is on the verge of approving the Russian vaccine Sputnik V following the publication of promising early results of an advanced study, Mexican officials have said, AP reports.Assistant health secretary Hugo López-Gatell, the government’s pandemic spokesman, said that the health ministry signed a contract Monday for 400,000 doses of Sputnik V that will arrive this month. He said regulatory approval was expected within hours.Once approved, the Russian vaccine would become the third to receive emergency approval in Mexico. The regulating agency approved the Pfizer vaccine in December and AstraZeneca’s in January. Mexico turned to the Russian vaccine following delays in obtaining others it was counting on.A dozen countries have already approved the Russian vaccine for use, including Bolivia and Argentina, where López-Gatell visited in January to learn more about it. He acknowledged that there had a been a “legitimate concern” among Mexicans, but that the early results published Tuesday in the medical journal the Lancet should alleviate them.Saudi Arabia has suspended entry to the kingdom from 20 countries, with the exception of diplomats, Saudi citizens, medical practitioners and their families, to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, the state news agency reported.The temporary ban, effective from 3 February, includes people arriving from the United Arab Emirates, Germany, the US, Britain, South Africa, France, Egypt, Lebanon, India and Pakistan, Reuters reports.126 were also recorded in the northern city of Thessaloniki. “It’s a serious surge that has less to do with the new variants we are seeing and more with fatigue and people flouting rules,” infectious disease expert Gkikas Magiorkinis told the . To date 202 people have been diagnosed with mutated forms of the virus. On Friday, the government announced it was reimposing restrictions barely two weeks after its had allowed shops to reopen two months after their enforced closure as part of a nationwide lockdown that began on November 7th. The decision followed a sharp rise in cases in recent weeks. As of Saturday Greeks have had access to stores only if they make an appointment beforehand under a system known as Click Inside. They can also leave their homes - to shop or exercise – if they notify authorities via text message. The latest case count brings Greece’s total number of confirmed coronavirus infections to 158,716. The death toll now stands at 5,851 after a further 22 fatalities were also announced Tuesday. Magiorkinis, who sits on the committee that advises Athens’ centre right administration, said he did have some hope, however, that the situation would improve. “By the end of February we will have completed the vaccination programme in nearly all care homes for the elderly and for most health care workers,” he said. “They are core groups who are especially vulnerable. Completing that process will have a significant effect in hospitals and the stress placed on the health system.” Oxford University said the findings supported a decision made by the UK to extend the interval between initial doses and booster doses of the shot to 12 weeks.AstraZeneca has welcomed the move, saying flexibility to extend the time between doses is the best strategy for the shot.The results, gathered from trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, indicated some protection was given after one shot and that immune responses were boosted with a longer interval to the second dose among participants aged 18 to 55 years.Spain has recorded 724 Covid deaths over the past 24 hours - the highest daily total since the first wave of the virus hit the country last April. To date, 59,805 people have lost their lives to Covid in Spain, according to official figures. The country also logged 29,064 cases between Monday and Tuesday, bringing the total to 2,851,869. However, the number of cases per 100,000 people over the past fortnight fell once again, dropping from 866 on Monday to 847 on Tuesday.Spain has so far administered 1,673,054 doses doses of the vaccine to its population of nearly 47 million people. More than 418,500 people have already received both doses.The Palestinian Authority has begun vaccinating its health workers in the occupied West Bank against Covid-19 after receiving doses from Israel, Palestinian officials said, AFP reports.Israel’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it would send 5,000 vaccine doses to the Palestinian Authority to inoculate medical workers. “We started today,” Palestinian health minister Mai al-Kaila said.She added that on Wednesday a supply of doses would be sent to Gaza, an Israeli-blockaded territory controlled by Hamas Islamists, so that inoculation of front line workers could begin in the enclave.“We have given highest priority to health personnel... and those working in intensive care units,” she said in a video distributed by Palestinian television."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4474533.1612301505!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers unions oppose hybrid leaving cert proposal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers’ unions have expressed their strong opposition to students being given a choice between exams and calculated grades in talks with the Department of Education. Photograph: Nick BradshawTeachers’ unions have expressed their strong opposition to students being given a choice between exams and calculated grades in talks with the Department of Education.An advisory group of education stakeholders held a meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss planning for the State exams which was attended by Minister for Education Norma Foley.Sources said a number of options for assessing students were presented at the meeting.They include delaying Leaving Cert exams until later in the summer giving students calculated grades instead of exams an “open access” model with additional college places and versions of a “hybrid” model combining exams and calculated grades.Politically, the latter option is seen by some Government Ministers as the most attractive on the basis that it has support from both student and parents’ groups, as well as Opposition political parties.However, such a move would require the co-operation of unions, which have called for exams to go ahead.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland both want modified exams with greater choice to proceed.Sources say teachers’ representatives voiced major concerns at the advisory group meeting over the feasibility of any proposal which combines calculated grades and exams.A key concern among teachers is that this would oblige them to rank their students in order across each subject. This proved controversial last year on the basis that students were able to access this information after they received their results.Other issues raised by teachers include the reduced amount of coursework available on which to base calculated grades, along with challenges in teaching students who opt for calculated grades or exams.Students, on the other hand, insist that a choice between exams and calculated grades is the fairest and most equitable solution.Reuban Murray, president of the Irish Second Level Students’ Union, said Leaving Cert students were under huge strain and a “compassionate” response was urgently needed.Clarity“We need to work within the parameters of choice being given to students . . . We need to move to a point where we give students clarity and certainty.”In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Education confirmed that the advisory group on the exams explored a number of options for the Leaving Cert, “which sought to take account of the impact of school closures on allowing the examinations to be run in as close a manner as in a normal year”.A further meeting of the subgroup is planned for later this week.Sources said it is likely that firm proposals will be put before the Cabinet next Tuesday for consideration.Separately, there are growing hopes that a phased reopening of all schools could see all pupils back in school by mid-March.Special education is due to partially reopen to thousands of children from February 11th following agreement with school staff unions, while special classes in mainstream primary schools are due to reopen from February 22nd.Sources involved in discussions said they believe primary schools will be in a position to reopen fully from early March.Similarly, sources are optimistic that secondary schools will also begin to reopen on a phased basis from late February.It is likely students with additional needs will be prioritised alongside exam year groups – such as Leaving Certs – followed by the remainder of secondary students."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"New appointments to Climate Change Advisory Council coinciding with enhanced roleMove will end fossil fuel prospecting and the future development of oil and gas fields\u0026lsquoDo you imagine not paying for your mobile phone or electricity?\u0026rsquo Lo\u0026iumlc Fauchon asks"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4474091.1612281950!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"steep ramp up of vaccine rollout from late april says chair of taskforce","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland is due to get 190,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine during February and a further 95,000 in early March,  Professor Brian MacCraith said. Photograph: iStock There will be a “significant, steep ramp-up” of the vaccine rollout as supply issues ease from late April and into May, the chair of the high level Covid-19 vaccine taskforce has said. Professor Brian MacCraith said the limit and uncertainty around supply has been the primary stumbling block facing the rollout of the jab so far. However, in the coming months the challenge will shift to scaling up the workforce and organising vaccination locations to match increased stock, he said. Prof MacCraith said initial projections suggest April to June “looks like the big quarter” in terms of the vaccine rollout in the State. However, he heeded caution in making precise predictions as there remains a “sea of uncertainty” around supply.He said the HSE has undertaken a huge amount of work to increase its ability to administer doses across the country as supply improves, adding: “This moves from a supply uncertainty issue to an administration issue . . . We have said we would not be keeping vaccines in the fridges or the freezer and we would administer vaccines as soon as they arrive.”So far, 207,330 vaccines have been delivered to Ireland, of which 199,800 have been administered, latest figures show.He said within the European Union, Ireland has remained in the “top two or three in terms of the scale of rollout, proportionate to our population”. The third group on the vaccine priority list, people aged over 85 living in the community, are “next in line”, Prof MacCraith said, adding they will begin to receive invitations from their GPs over the next two weeks.Extra dosesProfessor MacCraith was speaking to Newstalk Breakfast ahead of the expected approval by Cabinet of the purchase of almost a million extra doses of the Moderna vaccine. It is hoped that up to one million doses of the vaccine will be delivered to Ireland by July.Originally the Government had signed up to about 880,000 vaccines from the US drug firm with the EU advanced purchase scheme, but this figure is now due to increase to about 1.75 million doses, Prof MacCraith said.Meanwhile, the first batch of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are due to arrive at the beginning or middle of next week, Prof MacCraith said. It is planned these will be deployed “almost as soon as they arrive”, he said. Prof MacCraith said the AstraZeneca vaccine was “particularly attractive” due to its less complicated storage requirements and said it is more suited to community rollout than the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.Ireland is due to get 190,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine during February and a further 95,000 in early March, he said. However, the task force is awaiting confirmation from AstraZeneca as to how an additional nine million doses secured by the EU translates into Irish supply. The AstraZeneca order complements the positive news announced on Monday that an additional 75 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be delivered to countries in the EU in the second quarter of the year. In a separate radio interview on Tuesday with RTÉ, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the focus for the vaccination programme this week will be getting a second dose to frontline workers and care home residents.He said the programme will then move to give first doses to a second group of frontline workers. Asked when that would happen, the Minister said “very soon”.The rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine via GPs to the over-85 cohort would also commence “very shortly”, he added.When asked about the timeline of the vaccine rollout and the possibility of major sporting and cultural events happening later in the year, Mr Donnelly said he hoped such events could happen.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) would have to look at how quickly the risk of transmission was going down as more people were vaccinated. “Nphet will look at how we’re doing on the numbers,” he said.There was “an awful lot” still to be learned about the vaccine such as how long it would offer protection. “We’re all watching Israel,” he added, referring to one country which has made progress with a rapid rollout of vaccines.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4474407.1612301354!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland in line to vaccinate half its population by end june eu data shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 18.5 million doses of vaccines were delivered in January and shared among the 27 member states, 17.6 million of them Pfizer-BioNTech doses, according to Commission figures. Photograph: by Christof StacheAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union expects to have received 406.5 million vaccine doses by the end of June, putting Ireland in line to vaccinate roughly half of its population by then according to a new EU delivery schedule, The  has learnt.According to the latest figures, the European Commission expects 33 million doses of overall Covid-19 vaccines to be delivered this month, 55 million doses in March, and 300 million between April and June.In all, 18.5 million doses of vaccines were delivered in January and shared among the 27 member states, 17.6 million of them Pfizer-BioNTech doses and the remainder made by Moderna, according to Commission figures.All are made available to member states depending on population size, meaning that if Ireland opts to take all of its available doses it would be in line to have received in the region of 4.47 million doses by the end of June, reflecting its population of about 1.1 percent of the overall EU.The number of people who can be vaccinated by the deliveries depends on how many of the doses are of two-shot vaccines, and how many are of the single-shot vaccine currently under development by Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.So far, only Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have applied for and received authorisation from the European Medicines Agency. Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has indicated it hopes to be in a position to apply for approval this month.Previously, the European Commission told member states there would be enough vaccines to inoculate 70 per cent of the adult populations “by summer”, though the precise date was left unclear and the goal was indicated by some officials to mean by the end of summer.Overall, the bloc has booked up 2.3 billion doses of vaccines, including 400 million from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, 600 million from Pfizer, 400 million from AstraZeneca and 160 million from Moderna.The new figures, which have been briefed by the Commission in closed-door meetings, follow talks in recent days between the EU executive and pharmaceutical companies that are contracted to deliver vaccines to the bloc.They include an upward revision of expected deliveries from Pfizer and from British-Swedish multinational AstraZeneca, which raised the number of doses promised by March to 40 million from 31 million after a bitter spat with the bloc last week over a slowed fulfilment schedule.EU authorities have been alarmed by the emergence of new variants of Covid-19, which has raised the prospect of strains of the virus spreading among the population that vaccines are less effective against.Work is already ongoing with pharmaceutical companies to boost vaccine production capacity within the bloc and streamline regulatory approval procedures in anticipation that an update or “new generation” of the vaccines will be needed to combat vaccine-resistant mutations of the virus.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: We won’t save our imperfect planet by driving billions into destitutionRichard III did order the murder of the Princes in the Tower, professor claimsUniversity watchdog to crack down on institutions which don\u0026#39t use IHRA definition of antisemitismBritain\u0026#39s food supplies threatened if we close borders, warns ministerYou\u0026#39ll never walk alone: How Captain Sir Tom Moore captured our hearts in the hardest of times Police chief pledges to arm all frontline officers with TasersRussia\u0026#39s leading museum \u0026#39insulting the good name of Fabergé\u0026#39 by displaying alleged fake eggsComment: I learned more in my summers as a lifeguard than I ever would have from city internshipsCoronavirus latest news: Single dose of Oxford vaccine prevents hospitalisation with Covid for 12 weeks, trial findsComment: Who would have thought it?

The Prime Minister’s expectation that some \u202813 million people in the four most at-risk groups would be covered by the middle of the month looked ambitious at the time but is now on course to being fulfilled.Over the weekend, nearly one million people were vaccinated and some areas are now rolling out the jab to the 65 to 70 age group. This is a remarkable achievement and one that has quelled criticism of the Government’s handling of the pandemic by both anti-lockdowners and those demanding ever tougher restrictions.The revelation that the South African variant of the virus is circulating more widely is a concern that has triggered enhanced contact tracing in a number of areas. But scientists have no reason to believe it is more dangerous or will stop the vaccine working, though it may be less effective.If the wave of vaccine optimism has eased pressure on ministers, this does not mean key questions should be ducked. The vaccine offers not just the prospect of protection from Covid, or at least its worst effects, but should also be a way out of lockdown and lead to the dismantling of controls that are wrecking the livelihoods of so many.Mr Johnson certainly sees it this way. He wants to open schools on March 8 and will produce a road map to normality after studying the data later this month. He hopes for a normal summer. We still do not know what benchmark figures are being used to determine when to ease restrictions but the key metric should be the occupation of NHS beds. Once pressure has eased on hospitals, the balance of policy needs to shift to dealing with the harms caused to the education of children and the livelihoods of millions.The latest studies suggest the Pfizer vaccine is working more positively among the over-80s than has been expected, even though most have had only one dose. Information about the efficacy of the OxfordAstraZeneca jab is still awaited but is also expected to have reduced the numbers requiring medical treatment. The signs are good but the vaccine must be seen not solely in health terms but as the key that can unlock the country, preferably by the spring.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"archaeologists unearth 2000 year old mummies golden tongues","story":"Archaeologists in Egypt have unearthed more than a dozen 2,000-year-old mummies, including some with gold tongues in their mouths, according to the country’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The Egyptian-Dominican team from the University of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic was working at the Taposiris Magna Temple in western Alexandria when it discovered the remains of 16 ancient Egyptians buried in rock tombs.The mummies were poorly preserved and in a state of significant decomposition, but photographs released by the ministry showed a human skeleton with a clearly visible, tongue-shaped piece of gold placed in its jaw. According to officials, the amulets “were placed in the mouth of the mummy in a special ritual to ensure their ability to speak in the afterlife before the Osirian court.” In Egyptian mythology, Osiris was the god of the afterlife, as well as fertility and agriculture.Dr Kathleen Martinez, who headed the team, explained that of the 16 mummies, the two most important had preserved alongside them the remains of scrolls and parts of their cartonnage – a kind papyrus or linen-based papier-mache used to construct the intricate “face masks” that envelop the mummified bodies inside their sarcophagi.The falcon-headed Horus was the god of kingship and the skyAlongside the golden tongues, the gilded cartonnage and the mummies’ location in rock-cut tombs suggested the mummies dated to the era of Greek and Roman rule, the ministry said in its statement.While the tongue amulets might have been the most striking element of the find, Dr Khaled Abo El Hamd, director-general of the Alexandria Antiquities, was cited as saying that the most important discoveries of this archaeological season were: “a funeral mask for a woman, eight golden flakes representing the leaves of a golden wreath, and eight masks of marble dating back to the Greek and Roman eras”. The Taposiris Magna Temple is thought to have been constructed by Ptolemy IV, who ruled Egypt from 221 to 204 BC, while coins bearing the image of Cleopatra VII have previously been found at the site.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"captain sir tom moore hero stood kingdom united","story":"In a national crisis in which heroism has sprung from many places, and in many guises, Captain Sir Tom Moore’s extraordinary contribution struck a unique chord with the British public.Within the space of a few months, he has become a symbol of steadfast endurance, a household name, a bona fide national treasure.He drummed up more than £33 million in donations for the NHS, which was an unprecedented amount. But that alone does not explain the remarkable way in which he captured the public’s imagination.Captain Sir Tom’s original aim was to raise a modest £1,000 by completing 100 laps, each a 25-metre loop, of his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, before his 100th birthday last April.He used a walking frame, campaign medals catching the light as he purposefully, effortfully, put one foot in front of the other, day after day. And soon the eyes of a locked-down nation were looking on, mesmerised and moved by his unshowy display of resolve.Amid the battle metaphors, it seemed fitting that a Second World War veteran should command such admiration for stepping up – especially after triumphing over skin cancer and a broken hip.At a time when the old were being advised to stay indoors and depicted as fragile, it was surely chastening for the young to witness Captain Sir Tom, a man of 99, showing such grit and mental toughness.Above all, it was a reminder that vulnerability to a virus does not equate to weakness, and age is no bar to strength of character or generosity of spirit.Almost a year into this wretched pandemic, we literally owe our lives to countless unnamed medics, nurses and healthcare workers battling against Covid-19 on the frontline. And so we clapped them, commended them, acknowledged their sacrifice and saluted their collective professionalism.By contrast, our debt to this doughty, determined centenarian who walked his way into the record books was peculiarly personal.We felt we knew him. And as his life took a turn for the surreal, we cheered on every achievement.He received a knighthood from the Queen and was made an honorary colonel. His autobiography, Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day, proved to be a bestseller and, such was his cultural reach, for children there was a picture book called One Hundred Steps.He topped the singles chart with a cover version of You’ll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball, and was given the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award in 2020.But even more touching were the gloriously idiosyncratic inidual tributes. In Tunbridge Wells, an elaborate knitted tribute to him appeared on a postbox. A 24-foot mural was painted in Southport. An estimated 150,000 people sent him birthday cards.In truth, our affection for Captain Sir Tom was due in no small part to a belief he was standing up for Britain.He was the embodiment of the Kingdom United pulling together, each of us doing our bit to defeat the unseen enemy, however challenging the circumstances.A grandfather-of-four, Captain Sir Tom had moved in with one of his two daughters and her family in 2008 after his beloved wife, Pamela, died from dementia.  Just under a year ago, when the country went into the first lockdown, he was adamant he wanted to give back to the NHS that had treated him.And so began an endeavour that far exceeded anyone’s wildest dreams.It was a joy to watch him revel in the limelight, whether interviewed on television or gamely posing on the cover of GQ magazine in full black tie and limited-edition Omega watch, like the original James Bond.His fame went global and the big-budget movie rights to his tremendously filmic life story were swiftly snapped up.When asked who should play him, Captain Sir Tom quipped that Sir Michael Caine or Sir Anthony Hopkins, respectively aged 87 and 82, would be ideal, providing they were “prepared to age-up”.Captain Sir Tom Moore’s astonishing legacy will live on long after him. He was an unlikely hero determined to make a difference without fanfare. He was dutiful and dignified.He was the very best of us.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter faces backlash india suspending accounts request government","story":"Twitter is facing a freedom of speech backlash in India after it suspended the accounts of 250 users on Monday at the request of the Indian government, which had alleged they had sent “provocative tweets”.A legal order had been made by India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, which claims the accounts had committed “incitement to genocide” by using the hashtag “ModiPlanningFarmerGenocide.”On January 26, protesting farmers and the police had clashed in New Delhi over proposed agriculture bills which farmers argue will decimate their profits, the violence resulting in the death of one farmer.Among the accounts suspended were the independent, investigative news site Caravan India, the chief executive of the state-run broadcaster Prasar Bharti, Shashi Shekhar Vempati and political commentator Sanjukta Basu.Throughout Monday, Indians took to Twitter to demand the accounts were restored, arguing the social media platform was curtailing freedom of speech.“Journalists, activists charged with sedition for reporting on the farmers’ protest, their Twitter accounts suspended, the world cannot afford to ignore this dictatorship,” tweeted activist Rana Ayyub.On Monday evening, after 12 hours and amidst growing public pressure, Twitter restored the suspended accounts. In a statement, the social media platform said the suspensions were routine: “If we receive a properly scoped request from an authorised entity, it might be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time.”The social media platform said its investigation found the accounts had not broken its free speech guidelines and it had met with the Indian Government to relay this information.For many Indian Twitter users, the reinstatement of the accounts was not enough and they advocated for the platform to change its policy.“Since @TwitterIndia reversed its biased action of withholding accounts, is there going to be an explanation? Is anyone going to be held accountable? You can’t switch the users off at your will just because you can - that’s authoritarian,” tweeted Gaurav Pandhi, National Coordinator at India’s opposition Congress Party.Activists claim the suspensions come amidst an ongoing crackdown against freedom of speech in India, with charges also filed against nine journalists and a senior Congress Party politician, Shashi Tharoor, for tweeting the protester who died on January 26 was shot.The Indian police deny the allegations and say he died after his tractor overturned.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british gas chiefs accused putting","story":"NewsBritish Gas chiefs accused of putting a gun to the head of workers in fire and rehire schemeGMB national officer Justin Bowden said that in  years as a union official, he had never seen so much pressure piled on staff to accept new contracts – including an \"endless stream\" of emails and telephone callsmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsBritish Gas workers outside the Scottish Gas call centre in Edinburgh last week \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He told the Commons Business Select Committee: “I have never had a circumstance where before we have even begun formal negotiations, that the employer has put what our members quite correctly describe as a gun to their head and said that we sill sack and rehirenecessary the entire workforceyou do not agree to the changes that we want.”The bitter industrial dispute reached Parliament as MPs carried out an inquiry to companiesapos behaviour during the coronavirus pandemic.GMB members have staged  strikes this year and will walk out again on Friday for four days, as the union campaigns against new contracts it says cut pay and increase the working week for engineers under the fire and rehire policy. Some , redundancies are being made. Mr Bowden accused the company of poisoning the well by issuing formal notication of changes to contracts last summer before an agreement could be reached. Engineers are being told to work harder and faster, with a longer working week, he said. Calling for a ban on fire and rehire, Mr Bowden added: “It has no place in modern industrial relations, it is an utterly un-British type of mechanism.” Committee chairman Darren Jones said some tactics were “often used as a power play as opposed to trying to seek a negotiation, which is unfortunate”. He added: There is no doubt that many businesses have faced dficult trading conditions, but concerns have been raised that some employers are resorting to tactics such as aposfire and rehireapos and seeking to downgrade pay and workersapos terms during the pandemic. Labour MP Judith Cummins said the committee was probing whether British Gasaposs parent company Centrica was “taking advantage of a Covid pandemic to fire and rehire staff – and vast amounts of staff at that”."},{"url":null,"title":"its sin should inspiration need","story":"NewsopinionIts a Sin should be the inspiration we need to end new HIV cases within the decadeDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner says she took an HIV test during National HIV Testing Week in a bid to break a stigma which still hasnt gone awaymirrorShareCommentsByAngela Rayner:,  FEB NewsopinionThe show lted a lid on a shameful chapter of our nation’s history \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Not only has this wonderful show lted a lid on a shameful chapter of our nation’s history that has gone untold for far too long, like all good story-telling it has the power to stir something within all of us and make us determined to end the HIV epidemic once and for all. The show captures the pain, struggles and horrendous stigma faced by people diagnosed with HIV, many of whom went on to develop AIDS and sadly die. But also the allies who dared to stand in solidarity with those affected. I was incredibly moved by the way Lydia West’s character, Jill Nalder, captures this, showing selfless determination to help these young men who were frightened for their lives. The importance of speaking out and challenging misinformation when it comes to HIV hasn’t gone away.That’s because despite the huge progress in the fight against HIV, which means a HIV diagnosis will likely consist of daily medication and the ability to live a long and healthy le, stigma is still re.In a matter of just a few decades, HIV has gone from being a death sentence for many to now being a manageable condition, yet for the majority of people this progress has largely passed them by. That’s why I’m still so proud that my firstPride in London was marching with the HIV charity, Terrence Higgins Trust. I was horried to learn that despite the advances in science, nearly half of UK adults wouldn’t want to kiss someone living with HIV. Let me make this clear: there is zero risk of transmission by kissing or saliva. I wear my heart on my sleeve when it comes to politics and causes I’m passionate about, and that day I shouted from the rooftops that people living with HIV can’t pass on the virus. We must not cease until that call is heard.The outpouring of emotion and the warm words that have followed It’s A Sin hitting our screens must be joined with action.In the UK there are still around , people living with HIV who don’t know their status and often it is this fear that holds people back.That’s why for National HIV Testing Week, I had a HIV test myself. Why  Because everyone should know their status, but also because the Terence Higgins Trust wrote to me and said that I can do something small to help break the stigma that looms so large for so many. If me taking a test encourages just one other person to do the same, I will happily take one every year. The test took just a few minutes, can be done in private and is free. In fact, all this week anyone living in England can order a free test kit to do at home. The LGBT+ community has always made me feel welcome ever since I was a teenager who was made to feel like an ‘outsider’, so I am proud to be an ally and proud of our Party’s history of championing LGBT+ equality, from scrapping the Tories’ toxic Section  that allowed homophobia to plague our schools for decades to making sure that Ministers finally rolled out anti-HIV drugs on the NHS.

Downing Street did not rule out reports that letters could start going out to people aged  to -years-old next week, saying it was a matter for inidual hospitals and GPs. Boris Johnson pledged to deliver first doses to the most vulnerable groups by February , which includes the over s, the clinically extremely vulnerable, care home residents and front line NHS and care workers.The Prime Minister made the commitment when he plunged England into the latest lockdown and hitting the target is key to any easing of restrictions. Whitehall insiders are said to be growing more optimistic about the pace of the vaccine rollout, with more than .million first doses administered so far. An average of , first doses of vaccine are needed each day in order to meet the target of  million first doses by mid February. A government source told The : “We are cautiously optimistic about the target, and looking ahead to the next age groups.” Askedthe letters would start going out next week to the over s, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: As you know, the priority is to ensure that we vaccinate all those who are in the top four groups by February . Then the next step after that will be to ensure not only that those in the top four groups receive their second dose within  weeks but then continuing the roll out of the vaccine to the rest of the phase one cohort. Iaposve said before that we want to ensure momentum, that we continue with the momentum we have built in the vaccination programme and of course, once weaposve completed the top four groups, we will then continue to roll the vaccine out to the rest of phase one. Pressed again on whether over s would be invited, he said: That would be a matter for inidual hospitals and GPs and those who are providing the vaccines. But as I say, you can expect to see us continue the rollout of the vaccination programme.He added: We want to continue to build on the excellent work that has been undertaken so far to ensure we get as many vaccines to as many people as possible. Hopes are mounting that every adult in the UK could be offered their first dose of the coronavirus jab by May, Sky News claimed. However Government sources dampened expectation that the first jabs could be delivered to the public within four months.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gave a more cautious estimate last month, suggesting all adults could get the initial dose by September.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is reported to have asked ministers to ramp up preparations for the reopening of schools, with further measures expected to help children catch up after months away from the classroom."},{"url":null,"title":"tories admit significant brexit border","story":"NewsTories admit signicant Brexit border problems and call for grace period extensionSupermarkets in Northern Ireland have been hit by food shortages and some British businesses have withdrawn altogether since the protocol and its associated physical checks on goods came into force on January mirrorShareByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe border has been one of the most dficult issues in the Brexit orce deal \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Supermarkets have been hit by food shortages and some British businesses have withdrawn from Northern Ireland altogether since the protocol and its associated physical checks on goods came into force on January .

Stagecoach bus driver Kevin Woolley, , found out he had tested positive on January  having fallen ill with the virus just days before.In a poignant Facebook post to friends and family on January , Kevin described how he was struggling with a nasty cough that kept him awake through the night. Then, on January , at .am, the day before he died, he wrote another Facebook post with a picture of his positive coronavirus test result.In it, he wrote: Another week off work then. At least I know I wasnapost just being girly with a normal cold though!Known as a funny and loving father, Kevin collapsed at home and died a day later, Wales Online reports. In his post on January , he wrote: Worst night ever last night. Climbed the stairs at pm, started coughing and was still coughing after .pm. Finally dropped off, but only for an hour, then the coughing came back. Coughing blood in the early hours. Dropped off about am and was back up by am.Have you been personally affected by coronavirus  Let us know in the comments belowHis brother, -year-old Stuart Woolley, said Kevinaposs rapid decline was a huge and distressing shock for the family and that they wanted to raise awareness of just how devastating coronavirus can be. Despite being previously healthy, Stuart said his brother was found unconscious by his partner Carol in their Abercynon home on the morning of January . Paramedics were called, but sadly there was nothing more they could do to save him, he said. Train driver Stuart said that since his brotheraposs death, heaposd found it particularly frustrating seeing and hearing of members of the public breaking Covid- rules.  He said: Iaposm a key worker and while Iaposm, travelling around the country, I see people breaking the rules all the time - people with no masks, with masks under their nose, and itaposs so frustrating. You just want to go up and shake them and say look, it can take anyone. Kevin had no known underlying illnesses, he went to the gym and his fishing would get him up and about, as far as Iaposm aware there was nothing known to be underlying and the post mortem hasnapost picked anything  up. Stuart said his brotheraposs death came as an even bigger shock after his own experience with coronavirus, which he completely recovered from. He contacted me the day before his test and asked what my symptoms were, Stuart said. I said I had a phlegmy cough and he said he was coughing up some blood - not a massive amount. I think the only other symptom he really had was loss of appetite compare to usual. I previously had coronavirus and when he tested positive, I said to him on the group chat that itaposll knock you out for a week or so and fingers crossed youaposll get through it. Thataposs what happened to me, I rested and recovered. He had his test on January , the results on January  and he passed away on the morning of January . The funeral was only last week, so that knocked us for six.  Kevin is also survived by his three children, Joshua , Ffion, , and his youngest son Oscar, seven, from his previous marriage. According to Stuart, his brother was also cherished by his work colleagues at Stagecoach as well as the many people he met through his biggest passion, fishing. Stuart said: He enjoyed playing football when he was younger for a couple of local teams, but then, for the last  years, fishing took over his le. And thataposs the main thing that people have been getting in touch with me about - the fact he would organise their first fishing boat trips. He was doing so much with other people in the fishing fraternity. It was incredible seeing the amount of people who got in touch with me about him after his passing. He had been a bus and coach driver for around  years, he worked for Megabus and the local bus companies but it was mostly Stagecoach - he was working on the service buses when he passed. I had been talking to his boss at Stagecoach and they agreed for a bus to come and drive through Wattsville on the morning of his funeral in tribute to him. It had his name on the front and was driven by one of the guys he used to go fishing with.

In the run up to Christmas, stores displayed signs directly above racks of animal-fur garments reading, “No Fur Product Is Stocked in House of Fraser.” In much smaller print, the sign continues, “”. In the Edinburgh store, the notice was displayed above coats from French brand Pyrenex which are trimmed with raccoon-dog fur. PETA has reported the signs to Trading Standards who said they will investigate. “We are asking Trading Standards to stop House of Fraser from trying to dupe customers into buying the animal-fur products that no kind shopper wants,” says PETA Director Elisa Allen. “If House of Fraser wants to advertise that ‘no fur product is stocked’ in its stores, it can simply take the fur coats, collars, and cuffs off its racks.”What do you think  Let us know in the comments belowOver a decade ago the chain stopped selling real fur products. In  the companies then Head of Sustainability presented evidence to an MP enquiry saying, “We know from asking our customers that they are not interested in buying real fur…we do not want to have real fur in our stores.” But the chain, which was taken over by Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, has now been dubbed “House of Horrors” by fur campaigners after it started selling fur again. The decision to reverse its policy is unusual and makes it one of a dwindling number of high street retailers to stock real fur as shoppers have grown more ethically conscious. Items currently on sale include a beanie hat with a raccoon dog pom pom for £, a kids boy jacket made with Canadian coyote fur and adult jackets made with a Finnish raccoon dog trims made by Pyrenex and Parajumpers.Claire Bass, Executive Director at Humane Society International UK, which is campaigning alongside the Daily Mirror to stop fur sales in the UK, said: “House of Fraser’s decision to overturn its long-standing fur-free policy, at a time when retailers and designers are increasingly dropping fur for being cruel and old-fashioned, makes the brand look out of touch with consumer trends and demands. Last year it was discovered that other animals reared for their fur – such as foxes and raccoon dogs – can catch coronaviruses and pass it to humans, scientists have warned, after millions of mink across Europe were culled over fears they could spread Covid-.

The omission of aposPrinceapos alongside Harry’s name was simple enough to correct , a challenge us mere mortals will thankfully not have to contend with, although particularly important for historical record one could argue. Latterly was Meghan’s alteration, but on first examination the original document appears to be entirely accurate.  The entry read ‘Rachel Meghan, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex’.  The amendment, which garnered the attention of the royal sleuths, saw Meghanaposs names dropped in favour of stylising the former actress simply as aposHer Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussexapos.  A range of royal experts queued up to deliver their verdicts - ‘Unprecedented’ cried one, ‘extraordinary’ said another, as one more declaredthat perhaps ‘this was an early part of their plan’. Within hours, palace sources attempted to quell the initial outcry, with the suggestion that both changes were down to “clerical error and nothing more than that.  But no sooner had daylight broken on the West Coast of America, Meghan has instructed her spokesmen to publish an extraordinary rebuke of the Palace, suggesting it was they who “dictated” the amendments, while calling out “senior Palace officials” as the culprits.  Royal sources have revealed this has been met with a sense of “bewilderment” in the Palace. One royal source revealed to me that Meghan ordered her staff to make the change to Archieaposs birth certicate in order to to fall in line with amendments sheaposd already made to her passport. The amendment was made by Meghan and Harryaposs personal team when they had their own staff based at Kensington Palace, who in turn reported to Buckingham Palace, so the sharp rebuke of the Palace makes even less sense.Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, Wiliaml, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis and the rest of the family.

In short, Meghan already stylised herself as aposHRH The Duchess of Sussexapos, dropping her given names - and wanted some form of continuity. Well, no harm there of course anditaposs good enough for Pele and Bono I suppose why not! However, courtiers have diplomatically suggested the tone of Meghanaposs statement from her spokesman was somewhat unfortunate. One aide revealed: There is no set protocol with these things. The birth certicate is a civic document so there are options on how it is filled out. The language used suggesting it was aposthe Palaceapos who aposdictatedapos it is somewhat unfortunate, as it certainly wasnapost addressed like that. The statement and its wording poses more questions than it answers unfortunately. Diana may have preferred to style herself as HRH The Princess of Wales, while Kate is listed with her full name on all three children’s birth certicates - ‘Catherine Elizabeth Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge’.  Some will no doubt suggest, does any of this actually matter or should we even care, especially given - as Meghan’s statement puts it herself - “Thereaposs a lot going on in the world letaposs focus on that”.

The message came following reports that the couple removed aposRachel Meghanapos, the Duchessapos first and middle names, from the legal document a month after he was born, using the more formal aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussexapos instead.The couple claimed the change was dictated by the Palace, adding that reports it was a snub to other members of the royal family would be laughable were it not offensive. The firmly worded message has caused bewilderment among palace staff. An aide told The Mirror: There is no set protocol with these things.

This was not requested by Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex nor by The Duke of Sussex. They added that the outlet’s claim of a potential “snub” would be “laughable were it not offensive”. “To see this UK tabloid and their carnival of so-called ‘experts’ choose to deceptively whip this into a calculated family ‘snub’ and suggest that she would oddly want to be nameless on her child’s birth certicate, or any other legal document, would be laughable were it not offensive. “There’s a lot going on in the world let’s focus on that rather than creating clickbait.” Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, Wiliaml, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis and the rest of the family.

A few small tweaks can make a big dference - and they donapost even need to break the bank. One mum has won praise after totally revamping her house by adding an extra bedroom. The nty work only set her back £ - and it took her less than a week. Mum Amy Harty, , created the extra room in her Essex house in a bid to give her daughter a private space. She live with her four children, aged between  and , in a three-bedroom property in Essex. Like many people across the country, Amy was furloughed from her job and has been kept busy home-schooling her children. But she managed to find time to renovate her house by adding an extra bedroom - in order to give her seven-year-old daughter her own room for the first time. “Lockdown has been tough with us all being home  , so the need for separate rooms became more necessary now than ever before,” Amy said.  “I live in a three-bedroom home, two rooms are doubles and one is a single. “My daughter, who is seven, was previously sharing with her two brothers. “The third bedroom in our home is also tiny so I decided at the end of January to build a fourth bedroom by iding the largest room into two rooms using a stud wall.”  The DIY fan completed the project herself - with guidance from her grandad and the internet. And she has shared her sums for the impressive project - soyouaposre feeling inspired, you can give it a go. She said: “I bought the wood from Wickes for £. per plank and I used  in total. “The plasterboard was purchased from Jewson for £. per sheet and I used six sheets in total. I also spent £ for paint, so the whole thing cost just £..“  Explaining how she created the ider wall, the dedicated mum said: “I found the joist in the ceiling and screwed the first plank to that, then began building the frame from that. “Then I cut the plasterboard to size using a Stanley kne and screwed each sheet to the wooden frame. “Finally, I filled any joints and gaps with filler, sanded it all down and painted the walls. I scrubbed the floorboards to save on the cost of new flooring.”  The huge project took six days and naturally her daughter was left jumping for joy. But Amy has grand plans for the room, adding:“My two sons will have the other half of the room, which is yet to be decorated.The mum shared the final product on Facebook, and the post has racked up more than , likes so far. One fan wrote: “You have done an amazing job, looks so cosy in the new room.” Others were inspired too, with one person commenting: “Wow thataposs amazing! Iaposd love to do this.” “Looks brilliant. We are in the process of splitting out big room into three, it makes such a dference and I canapost wait until ours is finished, wrote a third person. Naturally Amy is elated with how her thrty DIY job turned out.

The sheet was discovered by Rosa Beckerton’s husband Peter, , while he was refurbishing an old piece of furniture for a client. It is dated February , , and appears to be written by an -year-old girl imagining the state of the world in . She correctly predicts a huge sht in technology and even forecasts the Zoom revolution. Describing her husband’shome from work she writes: “’Hello dear,’ he said to me. ‘I’ve just got to ring up my friend on the telephone’.What do you think about the schoolgirlaposs predictions  Let us know in the comments“’Well you’d better tidy yourself up a bit,’ I said. “In  the telephone was a square box thing with a resiver [sic] on top of it. “But now it is still a resiver [sic], but you can see the people you are talking to, for there is a screen where you can see the people. It is a bit like a television.” Upholsterer Peter found the note stuffed down the back of a sofa which was sent to him for restoration after being bought second-hand.  Rosa, , from Peterborough, Cambs., decided to make the it public in case the author, who would now be aged around , is still alive. She said: “When my husband showed it to me I couldn’t believe it. I thought oh my god, look at this. “It was just so interesting, because looking at it today she’s got a lot of her predictions kind of right - but in her childish innocent way she thought it would all happen in ten years.  “I just wanted to share it in the hopes that maybe the author might see it and recognise it. “My husband has found all sorts of rubbish down the side of sofas and furniture before - but never anything as interesting as this.” The letter is unnamed but comes complete with a teacher’s corrections and comments in red pen - including the verdict ‘Good’.  It begins: “The year is , the time is half-past moon dust. Here I am twenty-one years of age, sitting in a cushion of air. “I remember when I was  years old and I was at school, things have changed since then. “For instance, the television has changed. “In  it was a square box with knobs in front of it. Now it is a big screen with knobs on your chair arm to switch it on and off.” The schoolgirl imagines that she is a married bank worker. She says in times past she would have “prepared tea” ready for her husband to come home. But she adds: “All we have is a piece of chewing gum to eat. You may think that we have not enough to eat but you are wrong, because this piece of chewing gum is food.

They warn that ‘ignoring this will be at our peril’ as those with a mild infection are unwittingly spreading the disease, thinking it is just a winter bug.Dr Alex Sohal, a GP in Tower Hamlets, east London, said : These patients have frequently not even considered that they may have Covid- and have not self-isolated in the crucial early days when they were most infectious. “The national publicity campaign focuses on cough, high temperature, and loss of smell or taste as symptoms to be aware of—only patients with these symptoms are able to access a Covid- test online through the NHS test booking site. GPs have to advise patients to be dishonest to get aCovid- test. “It is vital to now change the UK Covid- case definition and test criteria to include coryza [runny nose] and cold, making them consistent with WHO. “Tell the public, especially those who have to go out to work and their employers, that even those with mild symptomsshould not go out, prioritising the first five days of self-isolation when they are most likely to be infectious.

Millions of Brits have now received the jab and the country is well on its way to hitting the official target of  million vaccinations by mid-February. However, some are still in the dark about the consequences of the vaccine and what they can and cannot do after receiving it.It takes a few weeks to develop immunity to coronavirus after receiving the jab, according to Public Health England.Both the Pfizer and Oxford AstraZeneca jabs have to be administered twice to a patient before they are fully vaccinated, although one injection still provides some immunity.Here are the answers to your questions about the vaccine: Can I drink alcohol after the Covid vaccine  Some alcohol charities have urged Brits to err on the side of caution by dropping the booze for two weeks after getting the jab, although experts do not think drinking will cause any problems.A Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agency spokesman said : “There is currently no evidence that drinking alcohol interferes with the efficacy of the COVID- vaccines.“We would advise anyone concerned about this to talk to their healthcare professional.”However, the charity Drinkaware said there is a chance heavy drinking  could interfere with your bodyaposs ability  to develop immunity after taking the vaccine. How long does it take to develop immunity Public Health England say it takes aposa few weeksapos for the vaccine to take effect and provide protection, according to the Daily .Trudie Lang, professor of Global Health Research at the University of Oxford, added that there is a aposclear dferenceapos in trial data three weeks after patients have received the vaccine.A  paper  published by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupsaid that  days after an effective vaccine, a high proportion of people develop immunity which is protective against disease caused by reinfection . How much immunity will I have after first dose  Data from Pfizer suggests its vaccine is around % effective after the first dose, compared with % efficacy following the second.However, the UKaposs Vaccine Committee, the JCVI, found the effectiveness of the first dose jumped to %, although the BBC reports that these findings are controversial.Meanwhile the AstraZeneca vaccine apparently offers .% protection after the first dose, according to a paper. This compares to .% efficacy after two doses - or % in people who have received a half dose followed by a full dose. Can I hug my family or go to work   Despite having the first dose of a vaccine, this does not mean you can mix with family. The vaccine will protect against developing serious illness, but has not been proven to stop transmission of coronavirus. Anyone who has received the vaccine must continue to abide by lockdown rules - which mean working from home where possible and not mixing with other households. WhatI have already had coronavirus   Studies into protection after having the vaccine and the immunity it offers are more robust than those into how reinfection works after simply having coronavirus. It is currently impossible to know whether you are immune having simply contracted the virus previously - while immunity after receiving a vaccine dose in most cases lasts at least five months. Will I need to get tested after the vaccine  If you find you are suffering from coronavirus symptoms then yes - you must still get tested and follow isolation rulesa test comes back positive. Despite having boosted immunity to the serious illness from the virus, self-isolation will be required as it has not yet been proven you cannot transmit it to others "},{"url":null,"title":"man shows worst flat rent","story":"NewsMan shows off worst flat for rent ever and people say prison would be betterTikTok user @Newyorkcityrealtor shares videos of the best and worst properties on offer in New York, and a clip showing a flat for rent that costs £, per month has left people stunnedmirrorShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video man-shows-worst-flat-rent-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

London is very much among the worst offenders and across the pond in New York it doesnapost appear to be much dferent - and a property expert based in the US may have found one of the most bonkers deals on the market yet.A realtor based in the city, known as @Newyorkcityrealtor on TikTok, has gained millions of views by showing off some of the places available for rent in the Big Apple.One of his latest videos has racked up more than  million views alone as he says: People ask me aposwhat is the worst apartment youaposve ever seen apos Iaposm going to show you. As the door swings open he quickly claries: And before you ask, yes, this is a real apartment. The flat consists of a single room with the hardwood floor space measuring up to roughly the size of a double bed and will set you back an eye-watering sum of £,per month in rent in the most desired neighbourhood in New York City of the West Village. The realtor gives the aposgrand tourapos pointing out its sparse features including a mini fridge, one narrow cupboard, a sink and a couple of kitchen bedroom cabinets. Thereaposs no oven, no stove, and no bathroom facilities in the room at all.  In a second video, the tour continues out into the corridor to find the toilet which is literally just as bad as you can possibly imagine. A key accesses a single toilet in a cramped room that barely leaves enough space to open the door - which is shared by everyone  in the complex and does not have a sink. Further down the corridor is a single shower in a similar sized room, again shared by everyone  in the building, but does come with the added bonus of a rack of shared soaps for your convenience. People were left baffled as to who would pay the high price to rent the flat, as one commented to say: So basically you get a closet.

Nicholas Henry, , had one too many last Friday night and woke up on Saturday morning feeling very hungover. His friend, Layke Lemercier, had the perfect cure for his misery so spent £. ordering him a sausage roll and sausage, bean and cheese melt for breakfast, despite the fact she thinks heaposs a food snob because heaposs French.Nicholas, who lives in Derby, took the whole thing very seriously, knowing how important Greggs is to many people, so he decided to write a review to share his honest thoughts. Finding his opinion hilarious, Layke decided to share it on Reddit, where the review went viral. Layke uploaded the review to the social media , writing: My French friend has lived in the UK for almost three years and has never been to Greggs.Obviously being British I just couldn’t let it go, so I got Greggs sausage roll delivered to his door.An hour later he sent me this. Alongside this was a photo of the detailed review, which took Nicholas over an hour and a half to write. It reads: I know British people are sometimes described as explorers or pioneers. And I have to admit that Gregg’s managed to do something groundbreaking with their sausage roll.  As I chewed and swallowed I simply couldn’t understand how something could taste so bland yet so revolting at the same time. Amazing.The crust tastes like cardboard that was passed through a food blender and then compressed together into a puff pastry. “The sausage is all over the place, sometimes it feels like mushy gelatin, sometimes it’s spicy. Yet I chewed through it and bite after bite I could see it’s intrinsic value. I canapost say I liked it, probably because I didnapost, but it was alright and it gets the job done to fill you up.  Nicholas went on to admit that he didnapost eat very much of the sausage, bean and cheese melt as it reminded him of the awful food heaposd eaten at school which didnapost hold a candle to his familyaposs cooking. He added that even though he didnapost enjoy the food, he was glad heaposd had the experience and now understood why people go to Greggs. I now appreciate why some guys in the morning go ‘d’you know wha’ mate  I could really go for sum fooking sausage roll now’. I get it now, he explained. That’s what Gregg’s is.

The feature is usually used for followers to vote on one of two options, with the person who posted it getting a list of people who have taken part in the poll. But one user discovered another way to use it, by positioning the poll with one of the options hidden off screen, disguising it not to look like a poll at all. In the example, a woman shares a picture of herself and her boyfriend on her story, and inserts a poll. She then drags the option on the left off the screen, and puts her partneraposs Instagram handle in the box which can still be seen. People will assume it is a tag linking to his profile, but instead it simply gives his girlfriend a list of the people who tried to head through to his page. The clip has been viewed more than . million times after being shared on TikTok by user @Meganvplatts, and some people loved the idea as one said: Iaposm laughing way too hard right now because Iaposm imagining their faces when they realise.A second wrote: I just did this and  people clicked. But others said the list doesnapost prove a thing, as one argued back: Looking at someoneaposs profile doesnapost mean anything. This is so jealous and insecure.

The Lions kept the pressure up following a corner and when Josh Mullin crossed from the right side Nicky Devlin was given the freedom of the penalty area to plant a header beyond Lewis.After racing into a two-goal lead Livingston were in control of the game and they made it dficult for Aberdeen by being disciplined within their shape, which meant the Dons found it dficult to break them down.The visitors were also a threat on the counter-attack with Jay Emmanuel-Thomas sending a low strike narrowly wide following on promising raid forward.Aberdeen’s first moment of threat came just before the half hour mark when Ash Taylor’s header from a Lewis Ferguson free-kick was easily gathered by goalkeeper Max Stryjek.The Dons suffered another injury before half-time with Taylor having to be replaced by Dean Campbell and Connor McLennan was also withdrawn and Callum Hendry handed his debut.These changes led to a change of shape to -- in a bid to change the momentum of the encounter.Eight minutes into the second period Aberdeen were close to pulling a goal back with Ferguson’s snapshot from inside the area deflecting onto the underside of the bar and bouncing down, but video footage appeared to show that it hadn’t crossed the line.Ferguson test Stryjek soon after with a drive from  yards.Aberdeen continued to pen Livingston in, but for all the crosses slung into the box a comeback never looked likely and the visitors could have added another with Scott Pittman’s low effort hitting the left post in the closing stages.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Tommie Hoban, Ash Taylor , Andy Considine, Greg Leigh, Lewis Ferguson, Ross McCrorie, Connor McLennan , Ryan Hedges , Jonny Hayes, Fraser Hornby .Subs not used: Gary Woods, Shay Logan, Dylan McGeouch, Miko Virtanen, Jack MacKenzie.Livingston: Max Stryjeck, Nicky Devlin, Efe Ambrose, Aaron Taylor-Sinclair, Jackson Longridge, Steve Lawson, Jason Holt, Josh Mullin , Julien Serrano, Scott Pittman, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas .Subs not used: Robby McCrorie, Jack McMillan, Marvin Bartley, Alan Forrest, Jaze Kabia.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 1 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals.

Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of .

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system . Other foods with high amounts of vitamin E include avocadosand dark leafy greens.Mushrooms\"There are approximately  species of fungi that have been identied with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities,\" says Euan MacLennan, herbal director at Pukka Herbs and medical herbalist at an NHS practice in London.\"Mushrooms are high in beta glucans ndash natural substances found to help prime our immune system, making sure itrsquos ready for action to fight off infection.\"Red peppersAccording to Healthline, red peppers contain twice as much vitamin C as citrus. Theyrsquore also a rich source of beta carotene. Besides boosting your immune system, vitamin C may help maintain healthy skin. Beta carotene helps keep your eyes and skin healthy.Fermented foodsldquoIf you like saurkraut, miso, kefir and their immune-boosting relatives, add just a spoonful or two each day to your diet, says Sara Davenport.ldquoFermented foods encourage the growth of good bacteria in your gut and when their levels are high, so are your immune levels, defending you from viral infections."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-man-ordered-80-hours-unpaid-work","story":"WHEN police officers visited a womans house in Galashiels while enforcing a warrant, they discovered a -year-old man in the premises.But Andrew Atkinson was already the subject of a non-harassment order not to contact the woman and was subsequently arrested.Depute fiscal Ross Price told Selkirk Sherf Court the police had visited the house in connection with an unrelated matter at around .pm on December .They discovered Atkinson and also his partner who he was banned from contacting.The court heard that the partner had asked for the non-harassment order to be revoked.Atkinson, who gave an alternative address in Galashiels, was sentenced to  hours of unpaid work for breaching the order.Sherf Kenneth McGowan agreed with a request from defence lawyer Mat Patrick to revoke the non-harassment order."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-vaccine-passport","story":"A Covid- vaccine passport system may soon be introduced in Scotland.Jason Leitch, the countrys national clinical director, said the passports are an \"interesting concept\".But what are the passports, and how would they work in Scotland What is a vaccine passport A vaccine passport is an internationally recognised travel pass which would prove whether or not people have had a Covid vaccine.It could,implemented, allow people to prove their status and potentially travel abroad.It is being pushed forward by former prime minister Tony Blair, who told Boris Johnson thatBritain should use itspresidency of the G to launch theldquointernational Covid Pass.What would a vaccine passport look like It is far too early to say, however Mr Blair says he believes the passport scheme should consist of a single, standardised digital system.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome.

This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It’s a fantastic way to get more active and also help feed hungry children in the world’s poorest communities.#Funds raised will allow Mary’s Meals to provide hungry children in some of the world’s poorest areas with a nutritious daily meal. The promise of food attracts impoverished children to the classroom, where they can gain an education that will one day hopefully be their ladder out of poverty.And thanks to Double the Love, donations made will go twice as far. Give until January , and the UK government with match public donations to the charity, up to £ million.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement at Mary’s Meals, said: #Whether it’s doing your regular run, getting on your bike or upping your daily step count, we hope that lots of people will get moving and take part in Miles For Mary’s Meals.#Those taking part in Miles For Mary’s Meals are asked to ensure that they participate in their chosen exercise challenge safely and in line with Covid- restrictions in their local area.To find out more about organising your own Miles For Mary’s Meals fundraiser, visit marysmeals.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face.

The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He will work with inidual police wildle liaison officers, NGOs, the Scottish Government, NatureScot, RSPB, the SSPCA and Scottish Land and Estates. The position is funded by NatureScot.PC Ross was the community police officer for Dunbar, and has  years of police service and an extensive background in wildle crime issues, community policing, problem solving and educational work.Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Ben Macpherson MSP said: #Wildle crime is despicable and tackling it has been a long-standing priority for the Scottish Government.#We work closely with a number of agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.#The Animals and Wildle Act, which recently became law, increases the maximum penalties for the most serious wildle crimes and extends the time available to Police Scotland to investigate.#The work of the National Wildle Crime Unit is hugely valued by communities across Scotland and we are committed to supporting it. I look forward to working with PC Ross in the future and congratulate him on his new role.#PC Ross said: #When I was in Edinburgh, very early in my service, I became involved in investigating wildle crime because of my interest and experience in this area. I’ve been a part-time wildle crime officer throughout my whole service and the new job is the pinnacle of my career.#I worked very hard preparing for my interview and was very keen to secure the job, which is a dream post. I am looking forward to settling into the role and working with all the dferent partner agencies which are so important in the fight against wildle crime.#In the six weeks I’ve been in post I’ve concentrated on meeting many of the partner agencies we work with in wildle crime. Unfortunately most of the meetings have had to be done virtually, but I feel they have all been really positive and I look forward to building on these initial foundations, especially when we can meet face to face.#The head of the NWCU, Chief Inspector Hubble added: #I was extremely pleased when PC Ross was successfully appointed as our new Scottish ISO and I am sure he is going to be a valuable asset to policing wildle crime.#Andy Turner, NatureScot wildle crime officer, said: #Eliminating wildle crime is huge priority for us, which is why we’ve provided funding for this post since . Wildle crime doesn’t just cause irreparable damage to Scotland’s nature, it also affects tourism, which in turn impacts on the economy.#We are committed to working with NWCU, Police Scotland and other members of the Partnership for Action Against Wildle Crimeto tackle this challenging issue.#We worked closely with Gavin’s predecessor, Charlie Everitt, to prevent wildle crime and raise awareness. I look forward to continuing to this important work with Gavin and the NWCU in the future.#NWCU’s main role is to assist in the prevention and detection of wildle crime by obtaining and distributing information from a wide range of organisations and by helping police forces investigate wildle crimes. NWCU also produce analysis which highlights local or national threats.The appointment of PC Ross comes after the retirement of PC Charlie Everitt, who had spent the last  years developing the role of Scottish ISO within the National Wildle Crime Unit.PC Everitt furthered countless operations, provided expert advice to police wildle liaison officers and acted as the key central point of contact between the police and a vast range of partner agencies.He was well known throughout the Scottish wildle crime arena and his professional knowledge, enthusiasm, and willingness to assist were beyond question.

Friendships are created and cherished, time on the course is relished and iron women have continued to make their mark, and their own home, in Scottish golf.Produced by Glasgow-based independent production company purpleTV, the documentary explores the history of womenrsquos golf in Scotland and celebrates some of the little-known female pioneers.Golf was traditionally regarded as a manrsquos sport ndash a protected male environment that was out of bounds to the so-called weaker sex.From the early pioneers of the th century to role models who challenged the patriarchal constraints of male-dominated golfing arenas, the story celebrates the trailblazers who put Scottish womenrsquos golf firmly on the world map.The game gathered momentum among the Victorian ladies of St Andrews from , albeit under the watchful gaze of husbands and fathers who controlled the spaces women frequented, and how they used them.Over the centuries, while some women were open about their love for golf, their space was often severely curtailed and distinctive male and female spheres came into play.Transgressors such as Issette Pearson and Agnes Grainger developed strategies to create opportunities for women and, thanks to their determination, the Ladies Golf Union and the Scottish Ladies Golf Association were formed in  and  respectively, formalising the sport, creating competition and, fundamentally, a handicap system before men.Formidable golfers emerged, with several Scots leading the way at home and abroad.Professional golfer Karyn Dallas gives a shocking account of arriving at a club to play a tournament and finding a sign that said: ldquoNo dogs or women allowed.While Dr Fiona Skillen, womenrsquos golf historian and lecturer in history at Glasgow Caledonian University, said men ldquosupervised women to make sure they behaved appropriately when they played golf in the th century and land was gted to the St Andrews Ladies Putting Club.Dr Skillen said: ldquoItrsquos interesting that the land the women are gted to play on is straight beside the Royal and Ancient Clubhouse, so therersquos an argument there that this is in order for the men to be able to keep a watchful eye on what the women are getting up to.ldquoThe men check to seethe women are behaving themselves in a circumspect manner.ldquoThey are being encouraged to play but a very specic kind of golf itrsquos putting, itrsquos not challenging.She also shares memories of being in a golf club as a child, adding: ldquoI remember my dad getting very antsyI ever went near the painted line orI tried to step over the painted line.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems.

under the rail bridge on the townrsquos Spott Road to stop the animals from roosting there.Concerns had been raised that birds were swooping from under the bridge and startling drivers, while the animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous and all out of proportion.ldquoNor should the council be thinking of installing netting, as we know many birds can become trapped in netting and suffer horribly before dying.ldquoAlternative solutions have to be found.Vanessa Hudson, leader of Animal Welfare Party, described moves to kill the birds or install anti-bird netting as ldquocompletely out of step with the times.She said: ldquoItrsquos  and time for us to accept that we share our spaces with wild animals, including pigeons, and humane solutions should be pursued.ldquoIt is an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal, and nets cause nesting and visiting birds the most horric distress and injury before death by hanging, starvation or dehydration.Guy Merchant, of Bird Control Consultancy Services International , told the Courier that carrying out a cull would be ldquoa waste of time and money.Similarly, he suggested that putting netting under the width of the bridge could create other problems, such as trapping live birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community Council last month, it was revealed that work under the bridge was due to take place in mid-February.East Lothian Council said that the bridge was lsquohomersquo to ldquohundreds of pigeons which are causing problems for drivers and also fouling the footpath.It was said that work could take up to five days while the underside of the bridge was cleaned and re-netted in a bid to prevent pigeons from roosting there in the future."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

It involves minus points. The lower the score, the better youve done. And you will achieve that by spilling the worst things about yourself. So that, in a nutshell, is what it is: show us what a horrendous person you are.\"There must be some memorable stories \"Weve got everything from eating pets to scandalous goings-on in the bath. There are a fair amount of poo stories.

Its always the way, isnt it, that the stuff from real le is always the most outrageous.\"I hope the show taps into that in a very celebratory way because I think the show is a celebration its not trying to make anyone actually look really bad. Its just gleeful rather than condemning anybody.\"It must have been fun working with Lou Sanders \"I adore her. I love her as a stand-up, and I love that shes so dferent from me. Sue [Perkins] calls me The Onion because there are so many layers to get through before I will actually say what Im properly thinking or feeling. Whereas someone like Lou, its all out there. She talks openly about everything. I blooming well admire that.\"\"I call her the Keeper of the Filth.

Shes like a filthy Richard Osman to my Alexander Armstrong.\"And you make some confessions yourself, dont you \"Yes. God, I cant remember what. Did I say anything terrible  I did make a confession about working in catering on a friends short film. Everyone was working for free: the actors, the crew. Sue [Perkins] and I did it together and wed been slaving away, making food and snacks and drinks to keep everybody happy. There was this actress - I cant actually remember her name, she came to nothing! - and she had the audacity to come up and complain about something. And I thought, right buddy, youve complained to the wrong person because Im in charge of the food. So I snotted into her pasta and presented it to her.\"I felt really bad though because she came up at the end of the afternoon and said it was really delicious! But, you know, Ive been a waitress so many times in my le, and Ive worked behind bars. That sounds like I worked in prison. I dont mean behind bars like that. I mean bars as in pubs.

Within a month of trying it himself, Cho noticed improvements in his asthma, eczema and psoriasis.Of course, everyones body is dferent and may react dferently - its worth checking with a medical professionalyoure considering big diet changes, especiallyyou have existing health conditions - but for them, Huang says it was \"quite a revelation\".It encouraged her to experiment with plant-based foods, which initially felt at odds with her background. \"Being a Chinese chef, we experiment, and being a Chinese food connoisseur youve got to try everything,\" she confesses.However, Huang did find plant-based eating aligned well with the Chinese philosophies shed been brought up on by her family in Southern Taiwan.\"Ive always believed in you are what you eat, [and] a balanced diet,\" she explains. \"I grew up with my parents and my grandparents, and they eat seasonally.\"Think about yin and yang balancing hot and cooling foods depending on your body, a little bit like the Indian Ayurvedic principle of eating. If youre tired and stressed, your bodys very yang -youre always cold and shivery, then your bodys too yin, youre having too many yang and fiery foods.\"So how do you balance this yin and yang  Firstly, Huang says: \"You literally just need to listen to your gut\" - then youll be able to properly judge what your body needs. She remembers her grandmother saying\"you eat too many vegetables, you need to have ginger because vegetables are yin and ginger is very yang - its fiery, so it balances your body. On a vegan diet, you need to have more garlic, ginger, chillies - more yang dishes,\" she explains. \"Mostly, yang ingredients are from meat.\"How you cook your meals also plays a part. \"Steaming is more yin and stir-frying is more yang,\" says Huang. \"Overall, were trying to create the perfect balance. I think its really hard in the modern day to try and create this balance - to even understand it - but I think food is a conduit to that.\"We could be bombarded with all this technology and science, but you actually have to listen to our instincts.\"For Huang, it made sense to adopt a plant-based diet, saying it \"aligns with who I am\" - and the results make it worth it. Asked how she feels, she says: \"Much healthier and lighter, I just have more energy - but obviously everyone should do whats right for them\".The chef doesnt just think about the personal reasons for going plant-based, but the bigger picture as well. She says: \"If we look at ourselves as an entity, then look at ourselves in a greater picture, in a way it is a reflection of what weve done to this planet - the way we pollute the planet and the way we over-consume.\"Everything is about balance, sowere out of balance, then were going to be ill. The same thingwe over-pollute the planet, its not going to create the best environment for us.\"Her recipes are democratic, she says. \"Not all of us are from the same background, but we all love food and we want it to be a simple process. If you cook something and it works and you feel happy and satisfied about it, then youre more likely to cook again.\"Once people cook, its a way to express love, because youre taking care of yourself. And once you learn how to cook and youre confident, then you know how to cook for somebody .\"For Huang, this is the ultimate way to show you care, and \" you choose to cook compassionately, then youre looking after the greater and youre extending your love to everything \".Huang might look at things very philosophically but she does so with a light touch - and without any judgement. She just wants to encourage people to \"try it for yourself\". If youre thinking about a vegan diet, Huang recommends doing so with a group of friends, \"so youre not alone\".She says simply: \"Whether its for animals, or your health, or you just want to try something new, I think people should celebrate more veg.\"Let this plant-based cheesecake transport you to a tropical island.Not convinced vegan desserts can be luxurious Why not try Ching-He Huangs recipe for creamy mango and cashew cheesecake...Mango and cashew vegan cheesecake recipeIngredients:For the biscuit base:g fruity vegan oat biscuitstbsp mixed nut butterFor the cashew cheese layer:g cashews, soaked in water for  minutes then drained and rinsedml coconut milkg plain coconut yogurttbsp coconut creamtbsp golden syrupJuice of  limePinch of sea saltFor the fresh mango compote: mangos, peeled, stoned and diced into .cm cubestbsp golden syrupTo garnish:Zest and juice of  limeMethod:.

In times of frustration, this has seen him lashing out at other children. The heartbreaking result of this is seeing him ostracised by his peers.Such an impulsive, literal and over-focused view of a situation is not bad behaviour ndash although it can be perceived to be ndash and with the right coping mechanisms and supervision it can be managed.Read more:Pandemic: Virus: The Christmas gt I didnt want . . .

There are good and bad days, but all things considered, so far we have been fortunate and his school has made real efforts to cater for his needs.However, experiences of exclusion and discriminationpersist for many, which is why a commissioner to champion the rights of people with autism and learning disabilities could make a huge dference.

Although the industry is a big fish in the north east, it represents only .% of the UK economy a minnow in national terms.

The bad news is the present dficulties are not going away any time soon. They are an unavoidable consequence of leaving the single market. To remain in the market was unacceptable to the Brexit idealogues as it would have meant adhering to EU regulation. Cutting through EU bureaucracy has gone the way of the easiest trade deal in history and that pound million a week for the NHS. Instead, exporters and hauliers are buried under a mountain of crippling and expensive red tape.Itrsquos not only fishing. Alarm bells are ringing in farming communities, even before the promise threat of cheaper imported food kicks in.

The former red wall in England crumbled. Anti-EU sentiment fomented in fishing and agricultural communities fuelled Conservative gains.

When Sinn Fein, the DUP and the Archbishop of Canterbury unite in condemning you, as one EU official put it, ldquoyou can be pretty sure yoursquove messed up big time. This whole affair is, however, neither a vindication of Brexit, nor a condemnation of the EU. Itrsquos merely an example of the way in which far too many people are inclined to ignore basic points of fact in order to maintain that ldquotheir side is right.There are certainly some things to condemn. Emmanuel Macronrsquos claim that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine doesnrsquot work on the over-s is, letrsquos be blunt, a Trump-level lie. The EUrsquos intervention that created a three-month delay in its schedule, basically in order to save money and insist Brussels should be in charge, now looks like a bad mistake.But then the UK approach, which threw money at everything, and funded more than  per cent of the development of a vaccine that there was no guarantee would work, might easily not have come off. There are lots of other factors besides the EUrsquos bureaucracy and the UKrsquos good luck and good planning, including some ndash like the reluctance of a surprising number of EU citizens to be vaccinated ndash that are entirely outwith anyonersquos control.That the UK has, at this point, one of the four or five highest death rates per capita ndash even after you allow for the fact that not everyone calculates their figures in a like-for-like fashion ndash should certainly be an indication that plenty of mistakes have been made here .But itrsquos also true that the UKrsquos vaccination programme is, with the possible exception of Israelrsquos, the most effective anywhere. And it remains possible,it works as well as predicted, that the UKrsquos record may not in the end be as bad as it currently looks. Countries like Germany and France, whose per capita record in case-fatalities is within a couple of tenths of a percentage point of ours, could conceivably end up worse, as Belgium and Italy already are by many measures.One suspects that some people, that is the people who assured us that the UKrsquos failure to sign up to the EMA programme was akin to building death camps, would secretly rather like the country to fail. I can understand this tendency in nationalists who want to maintain that wersquove done better than England, which therersquos little evidence we have.Itrsquos more puzzling south of the border, unless you take George Orwellrsquos view that England is ldquothe only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality.But all these attitudes are seeing a global catastrophe as some sort of competition. Quite apart from the basic humanity of not taking that approach, itrsquos hard to see that party politics comes into the pandemic at all. Naturally the UK Governmentrsquos primary obligation is to protect its citizens. Evenyou think itrsquos done the worldrsquos worst job thus far, you ought to acknowledge that, in vaccine provision, itrsquos doing one of the best.

Western European countries havenrsquot had that option,they ever did, since this time last year.The UKrsquos contribution to vaccine development has already been altruistic one condition of the Oxford AZ plan was that it be sold at cost to developing countries.

Well, everybody seemed to be engulfed by it apart from Reed. He went on to win by five shots.To briefly recap the third round events, Reedrsquos second shot on the th found the rough. Believing the ball was embedded he picked it up somewhat haphazardly before calling an official. The official deemed it had been embedded, allowing Reed a favourable drop, but TV replays later showed the ball bounced once before settling into the rough.

When someone like Reed exercises what he thinks is his ldquoreasonable judgement others will deliver damning judgement, even when he is exonerated of any wrong-doing by officials. Reputations matter and Reedrsquos reputation precedes him. Heightened scrutiny, suspicion and scorn continues to be par for the course.ldquoObviously the talk amongst the boys isnrsquot great, but hersquos protected by theTour and thatrsquos all that matters, I guesssaid his fellow tour player, Xander Schaufelle, in a quiet, yet biting assessment of affairs.The remarkable thing is that Reed continues to thrive amid the tumult and is seemingly able to swat aside all the uproar and racket with the nonchalance of Larry Grayson flicking out a limp paw and cackling ldquoshut that door.There is, in many quarters, a grudging admiration for Reedrsquos combative, resilient spirit, brave competitive commitment and fist-pumping defiance. Yet, for countless others, he is a sullied major champion who is impossible to embrace.That is understandable. When he was captured on video essentially swiping sand away from behind his ball with a practise swing to improve his lie during an event last year, he responded to crowd heckling the following week by mimicking a shovelling motion as he walked off the green.It was a fairly crass action amid a contentious episode that should have led to humility and contrition but instead prompted petty posturing and unedying, self-centred victimhood.Last week, the RA announced a partnership with the management company headed by golf-loving pop star, Niall Horan, aimed at bringing more youngsters into the game. If some of those youngsters had a casual look at Twitter over the weekend, tried to get their heads round the more impenetrable detail of the rules rumpus and glanced through the general, mouth-frothing harrumphing and bawling castigations, yoursquod probably forgive them for thinking ldquosod golf, Irsquoll stick to the Playstation.Oh well, apparently therersquos no such thing as bad publicity.

Every day we fail.

I used to say it was like Chekhov.\"He elaborates: \"I love Chekhov. I love how the lives are very delicately written, but huge shts are changing inside people. But the external drama is quite gentle.\"I love Chekhov because his characters seem close to all of us our desires, our wishes, our disappointments, aspirations. And then I think The Dig does all that, but at the centre is this extraordinary discovery of an Anglo-Saxon burial ship. So the mix of history, Chekhovian drama I thought it was refreshing, given that theres a lot of stuff thats a lot more high definition, in film making.\"Fiennes - who has also worked as a director on films Coriolanus, The Invisible Woman and The White Crow - agrees The Dig is a nuanced story, in which there is a lot happening beneath the surface with characters.\"Those films are risky, of course, because they can fall flat.

The total number of deaths, under this measure, is now ,.Once again, I send my condolences to all those who have lost a loved one during this pandemic.Presiding OfficerThe level of Covid infections clearly remains too high.However, the most recent figures provide further evidence that lockdown restrictions are working to improve the situation.Average daily case numbers have more than halved in the last three weeks.In the most recent week - up to  January - an average of , confirmed new cases were reported each day. weeks ago, the average daily number was more than ,.Weekly case numbers per , of the population have fallen from  in week ending  January to  in the most recent week.Test positivity has also reduced. In the seven days up to  January it averaged .% - still higher, but closer than it has been in recent weeks, to the % that the WHO consider to be indicative of an outbreak being under control.Pressure on our NHS continues to be severe. The number of Covid patients being treated in hospital remains around % above the high point of the first wave last April.However, hospital admissions in this wave appear to have peaked on  January. They have now stabilised and are starting to reduce, albeit slowly.ICU numbers are more volatile, but they did not reach the peak of the first wave and appear to have peaked in this wave on  January.So all in all, the statistics show real progress.However, this progress is down to compliance with the lockdown restrictions.And the situation continues to be fragile.Case numbers remain higher now than in the week before Christmas.That means thatwe were to ease restrictions too quickly, there is a real risk that infections would rise again very quickly.That risk is increased by the fact that the new iant of Covid ndash which is more infectious ndash now accounts for around % of all new cases in Scotland.I can also advise parliament that Public Health Scotland is examining evidence suggesting that there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation of people infected with the new iant.However, at this stage, there is no statistically signicant evidence of any increased risk of death.Public Health Scotland is continuing to analyse the evidence on both of these points.I can also advise Parliament that to date there have been  cases of the new South African iant identied in Scotland. All of these have links to travel which means that there is no evidence so far of community transmission of that iant.All of what I have just set out underlines the need for continued caution in our fight against Covid, especiallywe want to get some children back to school later this month.That is why Cabinet has reached the conclusion that the lockdown restrictions must stay in place until at least the end of February.However,our progress continues, then I am cautiously optimistic that, as more and more people get vaccinated, and with the protection of some of the additional measures that I will cover shortly, we may be able to begin looking towards a careful and gradual easing around the start of March.I will give an update on that in two weeks.Let me now report on the progress of our vaccination programme.I can confirm that we have now given a first dose of the vaccine to ,  people in Scotland.That includes % of all residents in older care homes - which is a truly extraordinary uptake - and % of the number of over s we estimate to be living in the community. Irsquollto that point shortly.In addition, I can advise that % of over  year olds have already received their first dose.We are on track to have vaccinated, with the first dose, all over  year olds, and all adults who are classed as being especially clinically vulnerable, by the middle of this month.Vaccination of the  -  age group is also underway from this week.And those aged  to , and unpaid carers, will start to receive appointments from the third week of February.So we are making rapid progress in protecting those who are most at risk from Covid.Now, I expect there will be legitimate questions today about the overall number of vaccinations in Scotland compared to other parts of the U.K.That is reasonable. However, I would make two initial points.Firstly, we have been trying to achieve as high an uptake as possible in the top priority groups - and we believe we are achieving a higher uptake than where.So for example, we havenrsquot just offered vaccination to all older people in care homes - we have achieved an actual uptake of % amongst residents and % amongst staff working in older peoplersquos care homes.That really matters in terms of reducing the burden of illness and deaths.Similarly in the over s groups. The % I reported earlier is based on a cohort number that we think is overestimated.The work we have been doing with health boards to refine these numbers suggests that the actual uptake amongst the over s group is already closer to %.These uptake figures are way beyond anything achieved in the flu vaccine programme.Vaccinating the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible is really important, evenit takes more time to do so.It will help to save more lives.All of that said, though, it is clearly the case that overall volumes matter too - and that leads to my second point.As we make more use of mass vaccination centres for the younger age groups, we expect the daily rate to also increase.The figure reported today, for example, shows just under , first dose vaccinations were done yesterday - reflecting the opening of new centres.That is our highest daily number so far - and % higher than last Monday.So having achieved greater depth in the programme so far, in the form of high actual uptake in priority groups, our challenge now is to accelerate on breadth, in the form of numbers overall. And that is what we will be doing.It is right though that all of this is subject to close and ongoing scrutiny. And we will continue to provide the daily figures that allow that to happen.Presiding OfficerAs we continue to suppress the virus within our own borders and increase the protection of the vaccine, it is essential that we also guard against fresh importation of cases from overseas.This is particularly important as the virus mutates and new, more infectious and potentially more severe iants emerge.And as we look ahead, we must learn from past experience.We now know, for example, that by early July last year, we had almost eliminated Covid in Scotland but then allowed it to be re-seeded from overseas travel.We must guard against that happening again.It is to that end that the four UK nations have already agreed that travellers coming into the U.K. from countries with a travel ban in place will be required to quarantine in hotels.This is a necessary measure ndash but in the Scottish Governmentrsquos view, it does not go far enough.Firstly, there should be very few people coming from countries with a ban in place anyway.Second, this approach leaves open the possibility that people will travel into the UK from those countries via third countries.And thirdly, an approach to managed quarantine that only includes countries where new iants have already been identied is too reactive - because often by the time a new iant has been identied through genomic sequencing, it will already have spread across borders.I can therefore confirm today that we intend to introduce a managed quarantine requirement for anyone who arrives directly into Scotland, regardless of which country they have come from.Obviously, we cannot unilaterally implement immediatemanaged quarantine for people who arrive in other parts of the UK before travelling on to Scotland.So we will continue to urge the UK Government to adopt a comprehensive approach.Andthey do not wish to do so - as is their prerogative - we will ask them to work with us to reduce the risk amongst people travelling to Scotland via ports where in the U.K.We will set out more detail of how and when the managed quarantine system will be operationalised as soon as possible.I understand how tough restrictions are for our travel and aviation industry, so we will also work with the UK Government to ensure the sector gets the support it needs until such time as we are able to start to ease travel restrictionsPresiding OfficerIt is vital that we guard against the importation of new Covid cases.But it is also crucial that we continue to identy cases and break chains of transmission here in Scotland.We are already increasing the accessibility of testing ndash for example by increasing the number of mobile test facilities that are available, creating additional local and regional test centres, and making more use of fire service stations for testing in rural areasToday, I can set out a further expansion of regular, routine testing of those without symptoms.Firstly, we will from later this month widen the regular testing of healthcare workers so that it covers primary care workers in patient-facing roles - such as GPs, dentists, optometrists, and pharmacists.From mid-February, regular testing will also be available to all staff who work directly with patients in hospices.We also intend to expand the availability of regular testing in other health settings, such as addiction and mental health services.We will also introduce targeted testing to support some essential public service s, including emergency service control rooms and NHS.Staff and patients in certain health settings obviously face an elevated risk of transmission, which is why it is right to have such a focus on those.However, we know that there are some industries which also have higher transmission risks - such as food production and distribution.We are therefore working with businesses in those sectors, with a view to introducing routine testing for their workforces over the course of this month.Alongside these proposals to test people whose work potentially puts them at risk, we will be expanding targeted community testing ndash where testing is made available to everybody in a local area, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms.This can play a particularly valuable role in communities where prevalence is stubbornly high or starting to rise again.In recent weeks, local authorities have been submitting proposals for community testing.We have been considering those proposals in light of the lessons from the pilot projects conducted at the end of last year.Community schemes have already been agreed across  local authorities, within the health board areas of Fe, Grampian and Ayrshire and Arran.By the end of this week we will have agreed community testing plans across the majority of mainland Local Authority areas.In addition, mobile testing units are already being used for targeted community testing in Ayrshire  Arran, Dumfries  Galloway, Scottish Borders and Forth Valley.These testing units ndash which are offering tests to people regardless of whether or not they have symptoms - are already finding cases on a daily basis that would otherwise not be found.The purpose of increased testing is to break more chains of transmission.However, that requires good support for self isolation.The latest available survey evidence suggests that there is good compliance with self isolation.However, we know we need to do more.I can therefore confirm today that we will be extending eligibility for the pound self isolation payment to everyone on an income below the level of the real living wage.More details of this and the other steps we intend taking to support people required to self isolate will be set out by the Social Security Secretary shortly.Let me turn now to education.It is a statement of the obvious that all of us want to see children and young people back in full time, face to face education as soon as possible.The closure of school premises to most pupils right now is necessary - unfortunately - in the interests of protecting the country overall from the harm of this virus.But evidence of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by children and young people concern all of us - and they do so more with every day that passes.I am also acutely aware of the pressure school closures is putting on working parents and on family le more generally.Now, I have to be candid that our room for manoeuvre, given the current state of the pandemic, is limited.But I want to be equally candid about the governmentrsquos determination to use every inch of headroom we have to get children back to school.In short, the judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is thatwe all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer, so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues, we can begin a phased, albeit gradual,to school from  February.The decisions I am about to outline are intended to give young people, parents and teachers as much notice as possible, but I must stress that they are subject to continued progress in suppressing the virus and will be subject to final confirmation in two weeksrsquo time.However, as of now, our intention is that from week beginning  February there will be -- a full timeof early learning and childcare for all children below school age- a full timeto school for pupils in primaries  -  and- a part time , but on a very limited basis, for senior phase pupils to allow in-school practical work that is necessary for the completion of national qualication courses. Initially, though, it is intended that there will be no more than around  - % of a secondary school roll physically present at any one time for these purposes.We also intend to allow small increases in existing provision for children and young people with signicant additional support needs where there is a clear and demonstrable necessity.We will confirm these decisions in two weeksrsquo time. At that stage, I hope we can also set out the next phase of the gradualto school and a timescale for theof in-person learning in colleges and universities.Presiding OfficerI spoke about testing earlier on and that is relevant here too.I can confirm that there will be a signicant expansion of testing in educational settings to support theto nurseries and schools in the weeks ahead.It is our intention that those who work in schools, and in early learning and childcare settings attached to schools, will be offered at-home testing twice a week. All senior phase secondary school students will be offered this too.This testing offer will be in place for schools as soon as possible to support their , and we will extend it to the wider childcare sector in the weeks after that.We are determined to get our children back to normal schooling just as quickly as it is safe to do so. It is our overriding priority.For now, let me again thank young people and their families, as well as teachers, and school and nursery staff, for the patience and understanding you are showing during these incredibly stressful times.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, we are making progress, both in suppressing the virus and in getting people vaccinated.But the path ahead remains dficult. The virus is still circulating and, of even greater concern, it is mutating.So we must remain vigilant and disciplined.To get the virus more under control, and so that we can prioritise every bit of headroom we create to get children back to school, we must all stay at home except for permitted, essential purposes for a bit longer - at least until the end of this month.And when we are able to start the process of slowly easing lockdown, to give us all more normality in our day to day lives, we will have to accept that some mitigations, like physical distancing and face coverings, will be necessary for a while yet.And I am afraid we will also have to accept that the price of greater domestic normality is likely to be - for a period at least - not going on holiday overseas.These are not easy trade-offs. But they are essential as we continue our journey through and hopefully out of this pandemic.I am grateful to everyone for their continued sacrice.Please stick with it.Stay at home. Protect the NHS.

had pushed the inquiry to seek the messages, which were obtained by his trial defence team, so that he could tell the ldquowhole truth under oath.The inquiry asked prosecutors to hand over text and

himself.However Mr Salmondsploy appeared to backfire, with MSPs saying they felt it would not be in the public interest to publish the private communications.Publication of the media leak material is still under consideration by the inquiry.Convener Linda Fabiani said: ldquoAfter reviewing the material received from the Crown Office, the Committee has unanimously agreed that the private

complaints of sexual misconduct made against Mr Salmond in  by two female civil servants.The former First Minister had the exercise set aside in a judicial review, showing it had been ldquotainted by apparent bias, leaving taxpayers with a pound, bill for his costs.He was later charged with sexual assault but cleared on all counts at a trial last March.After his acquittal Mr Salmond said he wanted to bring material that he was not allowed to lead in evidence for legal reasons into the public domain.Some of this, which was discussed at a preliminary hearing, included messages from Ms Ruddick.Mr Salmonds supporters claim he was the victim of a plot by senior SNP and Government figures to stop him making a comeback and rivalling his successor.However a senior Government source said that theory had been exploded by the inquirys assessment of the material and its refusal to publish it.The source said: \"This utterly destroys Alex Salmondrsquos ridiculous conspiracy theories.\"Hersquos been

had sought the messages at Mr Salmondrsquos prompting, and ldquodisturbed the Crown Office had complied.It said the messages were irrelevant to the inquiryrsquos remit, but were ldquopersonal

It pains me to see that with % of our children out of school as a result of school closures, we risk taking away opportunities from our own coming generations.“The pandemic has illustrated better than most things the full consequences of the digital ide, with which we have lived for too long we see those areas of the country that have access to connectivity and those that do not, and the families who have broadband and sufficient devices for everybody to get home schooling opportunities, and those who do not. So when we come to the end of the restrictions and to rebuilding our economy, we must also look at rebuilding our own education system.”Reflecting on the impact of Government plans to renege on the . per cent Gross National Income target for international development, a Liberal Democrat policy while in Government, Mr Carmichael said: “Giving opportunities to young people in the developing world is not some act of altruism it is actually good for our own children and communities. I look at the work that has been done by Anderson High School in Lerwick for decades now through the Global Classroom Partnership, and I see what that has added to young people in Shetland. “The money—in hard cash terms—that we would be required to put in to meet the .% GNI target would already be much reduced not actually to meet that . per cent target is criminal.

However, there is still some way to go before our inter-island service is of a standard we see where in Scotland.#Orkney SNP candidate for the Scottish Parliament elections Robert Leslie said that the additional funding was brilliant news for the islands. He said: “This delivers on the fairer ferry funding calls that have been made by Lib Dems and the local authority and shows that the SNP government is in full listening mode when it comes to island issues.“I look forward to these enhanced services and reduced fares being put in place. The next step will be to engage further with the local authority and other parties on the replacement of Orkney’s ancient internal ferry fleet.”SNP MSP for the Highlands and Islands Maree Todd added: “The additional £.m in funding for inter-island ferries is a positive development and delivers on a key ask from local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Whilst it is the local authority that is wholly responsible for the ferry services they provide, the SNP Government is sympathetic to the financial pressures which fall on inidual local authorities, which we know have been heightened as a result of COVID-.#She added: “It’s worth pointing out that for a long time, local authorities received no funding from the Scottish Government to support inter-island ferries, it is only under the SNP that this has changed and increased over the years. Today, we have a pledge to meet the revenue ask in full, fulfilling the SNP government’s commitment to fair ferry funding.“Considering the draft Budget meets a key ask from the Liberal Democrats, I hope to see the party get behind the budget and support it through Parliament.”Orkney#s MSP, Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said: “This additional funding for our leline internal ferry services is undoubtedly welcome. Having been promised ‘fair funding’ by the First Minister since the last election, it’s remarkable how the prospect of an upcoming election concentrates the minds of SNP ministers.“Welcome too is the proposal to fund RET on internal ferry services. Some of these are amongst the most expensive routes mile-for-mile anywhere in the country.“Given we are still waiting for RET on Pentland Firth routes three years after it was due to be introduced and  years after it was introduced on west coast routes, it may be premature to celebrate just yet.“Of course, this will not stop SNP politicians from being first in the queue to pat themselves on the back. Let’s not forget, however, that Orkney has consistently been short-changed on ferry funding over the course of this parliament since the promises made at the last election.“There is a strong argument for the millions in under-funding now to be repaid. Indeed, it is a case SNP ministers themselves have been making to the UK Government over VAT payments for Police Scotland. If it’s good enough for police funding, it’s good enough for ferry funding.”The co-covener of the Orkney Greens, Councillor Steve Sankey welcomed the #long overdue# news.#The Scottish Greens won an additional £.million for Orkney’s ferries out of the budget settlement in , and this time around the Scottish Government has finally got there itself, after years of pressure from the three island councils involved and opposition parties,# Councillor Sankey said.“We’ve been saying for years that the knock-on effect of having to fund the deficit in ferry funding has impacted on us here greatly, and has precipitated budgetary pressures throughout Orkney. We emphasised that the situation was grossly unfair, particularly when compared to the huge increases in funding afforded to Calmac out west. The news that OIC will receive £. million next year is a relief, and will enable improvements in service such as Sunday sailings to the outer isles.#Councillor Sankey concluded: “Fairness with funding is all we’ve ever asked for, and now  years after Road Equivalent Tarf was first piloted, it seems that it will also finally be rolled out on our internal routes, although there is still no mention of the Pentland Firth.“Whilst this is good news, it now means that we turn our attention to the replacement process for our ancient ferry fleet which ranges in age from  to  years. It’s essential that any replacement proposals commit to a renewable fuel component, be it hydrogen, ammonia or electric, so that we can greatly reduce the high carbon emissions that afflict our marine transport sector.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will be used until a full restoration of the new cable can be completed.In addition, new overhead lines will be constructed. This follows around seven kilometres of lines being removed following the successful installation of the new cable.An SSEN spokeswoman said: “Following positive test results, plans are now being progressed to temporarily reconnect the cable until full restoration of the new cable is complete.#This includes the construction of .km of overhead line between the old and new subsea landing points in Hoy. SSEN is currently reviewing construction timescales but expects short-term works to be complete by late February , subject to suitable weather conditions.”The spokeswoman added: “There will be some restriction to electricity generation export during the period of the fault.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3595857.jpg--.jpg?1611825143000\n","title":"big ballymena response sought for big garden birdwatch 2021","story":"RSPB NI is hoping that more people from the Ballymena area than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.In the past year, it’s been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyone’s mental health and wellbeing. There has been a surge in interest in the nature on our doorsteps and many people have come to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times. This year’s event takes place on Friday , Saturday  and Sunday  January. People are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden, then send their results to the RSPB. Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK. Just under , people from Northern Ireland took part last year.Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI Head of Species, said: “With more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and I think as a result have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.“Last year people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but it’s not that there has been more wildle about it’s just that we’ve had more time and space to notice it.“By taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it. We’ve noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.”Just one hour every year for the last four decades has made the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch the world’s largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted. Last year’s results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens. Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  , starlings were the most-spotted birds in counties Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry – ahead of house sparrows – while Fermanagh’s number one bird was the chaffinch.Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world. While house sparrows and starlings may be the UK’s most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at Big Garden Birdwatch data shows that numbers have dropped dramatically since the Birdwatch began in . House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %. It’s a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.

From today, the penalties for using a hand-held mobile phone while driving will be increased to six points and a pound fine, bringing these in line with Scotland, Wales and England. If you are caught for a second timethere will be no more chances – you will face a court hearing, disqualication and fines of up to pound,. Newly-qualied drivers, who have a ceiling of six points for the first two years after passing the test will face an immediate ban. “But the consequences of using a mobile phone while driving go far beyond the loss of a licence. Distraction while driving is one of the main causes of road traffic collisions on our roads. Many of those collisions causing serious injury and some resulting in loss of le.“My message today couldn’t be clearer – drive responsibly, put your phone down or risk losing your licence. This is not a minor offence and you will not get away with it.”The Minister added: “The changes coming into force tomorrow will I hope go some way to changing drivers’ attitudes and behaviour around the illegal use of mobile phones. We need to call time on this offence and I hope that the loss of a licence will be a price no driver will be willing to pay.”PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said: “We welcome this new legislation which underlines our very straightforward road safety message. When you are driving, your focus should be on the road and what other road users are doing, free from any distraction. “Our figures clearly indicate that driver distraction, together with inappropriate speed, drink and drug driving are consistently the main causes of the most serious crashes which kill and injure people on roads across Northern Ireland. No phone call No message No social media update is more important than the potentially catastrophic consequence of not paying full attention when driving a vehicle.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3601460.jpg--.jpg?1612267602000\n","title":"vaccination booking line for 65 69 year olds now open","story":"A telephone booking line for vaccination appointments has now been introduced for those unable to use the online system. In line with the Department of Health’s twin track approach to accelerate vaccinations, both the online system and telephone booking line can be used by those in the - age group to make an appointment at one of the seven regional vaccination centres. While demand for vaccination slots is high, people are reminded that there will be enough appointments for everyone in the group so please remain patient. In the last five days the online booking system has been used to make , appointments. People are asked to reserve capacity on the telephone booking linefor those who cannot avail of the online booking facility. Where possible we would encourage booking appointments online. It is also anticipated that demand for telephone bookings will initially be very high. Therefore,you cannot get through initially, please be patient and try again later. Call volumes tend to be lower later in the day. If you can’t get through immediately then try again. The service is available from Monday to Friday .am to .pm. To fall within the - age bracket you must have been born between  April  and  March . Age and identity checks will be conducted at the vaccination centres. People outside the relevant age group should not misuse the online or telephone booking facility. Misuse will only make it more dficult for those to get through who are being prioritised because of their clinical vulnerability. GPs will be working in parallel to the regional vaccination centres and will focus on the  plus age group. This group cannot use this booking facility. GPs will make contact with their patients in this age group, therefore people do not need to phone their GP practice. This twin track approach announced by the Department of Health last week will help accelerate NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

other than a race to ensure that everyone is vaccinated globally to protect those who are most vulnerable from this virus - including those in low-income countries.“That’s why the global effort to ensure the vaccine gets to those countries is crucially important and the UK’s playing a very signicant role in that.”Read MoreVaccinated people must continue social distancing, warns chief medical officerHe continued: “In terms of summer holidays, no vaccine is % effective, even a % effective vaccine means that % of people are not protected.“There is no way of knowing those who are protected from those who are not protected. “What we hope with these vaccines is that even those who are not fully protected will get some protection from severe disease,indeed they become infected.“Because we know that evena vaccine doesn’t prevent you getting disease,you get disease, in many instances it can alter the severity of that disease and you may get a milder illness.Dr McBride added: “It’s an inidual choice and people will make up their own minds and it’s probably too early to be planning for the summer just at this stage.” Read MoreArmagh and Mid Ulster retain highest new infection numbersCovid-: Almost a year since the first case was detected in Northern Ireland,what have we learned Belfast Most ReadProfessor Ian Young#s role in fight against virus questionedDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowFresh graffiti targeting Leo Varadkar appears on another south Belfast wallStaff withdrawn from NI ports over sinister threatsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedLatest Northern IrelandPSNI investigate footage of #sinister# group of masked men patrolling east Belfast streetsLitter survey finds % of branded products dumped by NI public produced by just  firmsVaccinated people must continue social distancing, warns chief medical officerBrexit: DUP announces plan to undermine NI ProtocolLatest from Belfast Josh Duhamel confirmed as replacing Armie Hammer in Shotgun Wedding-year-old fundraiser praises ‘hero’ and inspiration Captain Sir Tom MooreA Saint among the sinners: The Premier League players who were quick to see redIt changed the game – Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta angry at David Luiz red cardUK’s first openly lesbian MP Maureen Colquhoun dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#m back again to clary my last refrain. It#s not your race that makes me tick. It#s cause you are a pompous p***k.It is the latest in a series of graffiti messages which have appeared in Belfast amid anger among some at the Northern Ireland Protocol, with a raft of new checks on goods arriving at ports from Great Britain.The PSNI have been contacted for comment.Read MoreFurther anti-DUP and Irish Sea border graffiti appears off Shankill RoadHate crime: Dodds condemns sinister graffiti threat to VaradkarBelfast Most ReadProfessor Ian Young#s role in fight against virus questionedDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowFresh graffiti targeting Leo Varadkar appears on another south Belfast wallStaff withdrawn from NI ports over sinister threatsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedLatest Northern IrelandPSNI investigate footage of #sinister# group of masked men patrolling east Belfast streetsDon#t take foreign holidays this summer, CMO urges NI publicLitter survey finds % of branded products dumped by NI public produced by just  firmsVaccinated people must continue social distancing, warns chief medical officerBrexit: DUP announces plan to undermine NI ProtocolLatest from Belfast It changed the game – Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta angry at David Luiz red cardUK’s first openly lesbian MP Maureen Colquhoun diesItalian president seeks non-political government to leadEric Trump hits out at Scottish Parliament debate on Trump wealth investigationRecord  deaths due to Covid- reported in Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A further one in  also had a bumpy start to their love lives between the ages of  and  and described their first smooch as somewhat unpleasant. Half said their memories were vague.But a quarter of respondents told Hastings Hotels, who carried out the survey, that their first kiss was really good, with almost one in  remembering it in exact detail - where it was, what they were wearing and the music being played at the time. It is an element of romance most are hoping to recreate on Valentine#s Day this year as they try to make the most of the day in lockdown, despite missing opportunities for a night away, alone time or a meal in a restaurant with their other half. There were , respondents to the survey north and south, where half said they missed hotel stays the most in lockdown, with almost three in  saying they missed romantic mealsand one in  said they just wanted to be alone with their partner . But three in  said they were planning to go the extra mile to celebrate despite Northern Ireland being bound by restrictions until at least March . Cooking a special dinner is the gesture of choice for almost half , while four in  said they#d choose a hotel break to look forward to after lockdown. Just over % intend to buy flowers.Duane Farrell, CEO of Relate NI, said how you should celebrate all depends on your love language. Relationships are an essential foundation to our health and wellbeing so it#s great to see that survey respondents plan to make an extra effort this year as relationship maintenance is important, he said. We all receive love in dferent ways, with the five main love languages being words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gts, quality time and physical touch.These love languages allow us to give and receive love in the ways we want, he said.For the one in  in the survey who are craving alone time with their partner, it may be that quality time is their preferred love language, he said. They may like ittheir partner carved out some alone time with them for a walk or to play a board game, as opposed to receiving flowers and chocolates.The upcoming celebrations are not easy for everyone, with many singletonsplanning on spending the holiday alone saying they felt lonely and wished they had a partner in lockdown. Fteen per cent of respondents, most of whom were men, said they were now trying online dating for the first time. Mr Farrell said not to feel worried by the prospect of a solo Valentine#s Day.Our relationship with our self is the most important one we have, so make some time on February  to check in with yourself and de-stress, he advised.Not all single people are eager to meet someone, with almost three in said there is less pressure due to the pandemic. Over half of Northern Ireland respondentsbelieve Valentine#s Day is special and more than six in  men and women believe that they are romantic. Julie Hastings from the hotel group said it is heartening to see. Like so many special occasions we#ve had to miss, we#re making the most of the situation, either by cooking a special meal or booking a break away for later, she said.

GDPR issues were cited as an issue by the Dublin officials but the problem has since been overcome and the information will now be shared.Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney held a meeting last night with Northern Ireland leaders Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill. Health Minister Robin Swann also attended the video conference call.Mr Donnelly told Cabinet he is finalising regulations that will require people arriving in Ireland from Northern Ireland via ports or airports to complete a passenger locator form.The minister also said legislation will be required to introduce mandatory quarantine facilities for people arriving into the country.There is frustration within government over the slow pace of quarantine being introduced in the Republic. One Government source said: “Donnelly hasn’t advanced mandatory quarantine on iota.”It comes as authorities in Britain are tackling outbreaks of the potentially more infectious South African iant of the coronavirus.There have been nine cases of the South African iant in Ireland to date and all were contained before they could spread in to the community.Irish IndependentMost ReadProfessor Ian Young#s role in fight against virus questionedDUP#s support takes a e in wake of Irish sea border rowFresh graffiti targeting Leo Varadkar appears on another south Belfast wallStaff withdrawn from NI ports over sinister threatsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedLatest Northern IrelandPSNI investigate footage of #sinister# group of masked men patrolling east Belfast streetsDon#t take foreign holidays this summer, CMO urges NI publicLitter survey finds % of branded products dumped by NI public produced by just  firmsVaccinated people must continue social distancing, warns chief medical officerBrexit: DUP announces plan to undermine NI ProtocolLatest from Belfast A Saint among the sinners: The Premier League players who were quick to see redIt changed the game – Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta angry at David Luiz red cardUK’s first openly lesbian MP Maureen Colquhoun diesItalian president seeks non-political government to leadEric Trump hits out at Scottish Parliament debate on Trump wealth investigation,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More importantly, she was a mother to four children. But because she was not married those children were taken away from her. As penance she worked ‘slavishly’ in Derry’s Good Shepherd Home and Laundry for the next  years, according to her son Robert. He sought answers in the s but the nuns who brought him up dismissed those approaches telling him ‘you don’t need to know anything’. As a young boy those same nuns branded his mother a ‘mortal sinner’ while ordering him to clean toilets at St Joseph’s Home – better known as Termonbacca. googletag.cmd.push He learned nothing more of her whereabouts. Out of the blue, Mr O’Connor received a phone call in October  informing him that Bridget had died. A short time later he located a communal grave at Ardmore but his mother’s name did not appear on the headstone. ‘FALSE NAME’ After  years of service in the convent, the Catholic Church had organised her burial but somehow the wrong surname, Conway, was etched on the gravestone. This week, at Ardmore Cemetery with an umbrella in hand to shield him from the elements, Mr O’Connor walks to Bridget’s graveside. “My mother was buried under a  name so it makes me wonder are any of these names correct ” he ponders, “or has the Catholic Church intentionally been putting the wrong names on these headstones so that family members can’t find these women ” googletag.cmd.push When asked to correct the error the Catholic diocese refused saying it would be ‘too expensive’. Holding letters from the Church, he adds: “I found them very defensive, they didn’t want to know really. “They failed my mother in death as they failed her in le.” After legal proceedings were initiated the Church decided to act. He points to the gravestonewhere the wrong name was crudely removed.  The correct name was then added to the bottom of an adjacent headstone, upsetting the chronology of the women’s deaths in the process.  However, confusion remains over the spelling of her first name. On the headstone it is ‘Brigid’ but in correspondence from the Good Shepherd Sisters it was spelled Bridget.     It demonstrates how little information the family were given but Mr O’Connor believes the accurate spelling is Bridget. In contrast to the modest grave containing the  residents, more opulent headstones were erected in the cemetery to remember nuns who ran the Good Shepherd laundry. GRANDCHILDREN Mr O’Connor was the youngest of Bridget’s children and she became resident within the walls of the St Mary’s home following his birth. Along with his siblings, he was raised in a children’s home and feels that his status as the child of a Good Shepherd laundry woman led to his poor treatment in the home. This attitude was reflected in the nature of the duties the young boywas assigned in the home. Furthermore, during his childhood he was not informed that he had two brothers and a sister. In , as a young adult arranging his marriage, he applied for his birth certicate and began to ask questions about his mother. His inquiries were disregarded by the nuns. At the time Robert and his we Kathleen assumed his mother was dead but she didnt pass away until four years later. With sadness and regret, Mrs O’Connor says: “She couldve been at the wedding, she could have met her first grandchild before she passed away.” She points out that in death they were treated with the same contempt. “These women were made to wash the priest’s garments because thats what they thought of these women, that they were dirt, the fallen women who were only good for doing their laundry.” Mr O’Connor adds: “My mother worked in a laundry from the day I was born to the day she died. That’s what’s so annoying about it. She could have been helped, she needed help and they didn’t help her. “I think it was a money-making exercise, it was a business they were running, really, I don’t think it was a charity. “The only people who seemed to be benefitting was the nuns through the labour of the women, rather than helping them to get on their feet. “I don’t know how you explain it, whether Social Services could’ve established them in the community and get them more confidence to run their own lives.” QUESTIONS Once again Mr O’Connor wrote to the Good Shepherd Nuns to request information. He was told that she may have been referred to St. Mary’s Good Shepherd by Limavady Hospital in September  but that there was ‘no solid information in relation to this’. None of the Sisters who were in St. Mary’s when she was referred are now alive, it added. The solicitor acting on behalf of the Good Shepherd Sisters went on to say that the home was run for ‘older girls and women who had fallen into dficulties and often had nowhere  to go’. Mr O’Connor feels insulted by the ‘dismissive attitude’ adopted by the Good Shepherd nuns and Catholic Church. “They said she could leave any time she wanted, but how could she with four children taken from her and no home of her own,” he said in response. The Mother and Baby Homes research report published last week pointed out that the Good Shepherd Sisters closely guard the secrets and privacy of the women who passed through their mother and baby homes and laundries. In some respects this is commendable and it is clear that this is the wish of most women involved, the report said, but it is also the cause of distress to their families. In this case, as a result of the inadequate levels of communication about his mother, Mr O’Connor has been left to speculate about her le and how she came to enter the laundry. He is convinced the nuns did not want the family to find Bridget. “I’m just assuming that we weren’t allowed to be adopted, because she would not sign, and that’s why she was kept in there. “I can’t say that for a fact but that’s what I truly believe.” In reply nuns informed him that his mother was a ‘very happy and pleasant lady’ who made St. Mary’s her home and ‘at no point ever expressed a desire to leave’. They added that she was not there on foot of a court order. He found that dficult to comprehend as it made him feel like ‘she didn’t want me, and she was happy to be in there’. However, he is distrustful of this information and unwilling to accept it at face value. Moreover, a barrister told him that his mother might have thought it was necessary to work in the laundry to pay for the upkeep of her children in their Catholic residential homes. Mr O’Connor reflected on the impact his mother’s disappearance on his le and how the lack of communication from the Good Shepherd Sisters compounded his trauma. Many questions remain unanswered for him: “Why she was in there so long  What did they do to help her  Was it just for the benefit of the nuns to get free work…”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The relocation will bring over  undergraduate students to the Magee campus. Postgraduate Health Sciences teaching will move to the University’s Belfast campus at the same time. Announcing the relocation decision, Professor Carol Curran, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Le and Health Sciences at Ulster University explained: “Now, more than ever, in the context of a health service that continues to face sustained challenge in tackling COVID-, we are acutely aware of the vital contribution of our allied health professionals. googletag.cmd.push “The Magee campus will best enable the NHS strategic emphasis on development of multi-disciplinary teams and rich opportunities for interprofessional learning.” The programmes will be delivered alongside Magee’s new Paramedic teaching provision, and Graduate Entry School of Medicine, both of which are recruiting students for the start of the  academic year. UU’s award-winning School of Nursing which ranked th in the UK has operated in the city for  years. Magee campus also runs one of only three Nursing and Midwery Councilcompetency test centres in the UK, established to increase nursing capacity and help alleviate pressures in the health sector. googletag.cmd.push Professor Curran added: “Bringing these programmes together will open up opportunities for an interdisciplinary student learning environment, as well as building on existing research collaborations in personalised medicine and cognitive analytics based at Magee. “Belfast is the most appropriate location for postgraduate provision - supporting the existing health sciences workforce to access continued professional development, alongside our current postgraduate nursing provision. “We value the input of the healthcare stakeholders, partners, students and colleagues who contributed to the public consultation carried out and look forward to working with them as we prepare for the first cohort of students in September .” A UU spokesperson said the decision reflects the University’s unique regional mission operating across  campuses at Derry, Coleraine and Belfast   Jordanstown, enabling access to educational opportunity across Northern Ireland and supporting wider efforts to achieve better regional economic balance.     The University has made the decision following a full Equality Impact Assessment , as well as review and analysis of responses to a public consultation that closed in early December. Professor Curran concluded: “We look forward to working with our colleagues, student body, Trade Unions, all the HSC Trusts and our many partners in Derry~Londonderry to welcome students and staff to this progressive school on our beautul campus in a vibrant university city. “Together we will provide the next generation of highly skilled health professionals so urgently required to meet the needs of the healthcare workforce and patients.” The School of Health Sciences is the regional provider of most of the Allied Health Professions workforce for HSC in Northern Ireland. This includes diagnostic radiography, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, speech and language therapy, radiotherapy and oncology, as well as healthcare scientists. Workforce planning within Health and Social Carehighlights the need for continued growth in this group of employees, the second largest in HSC. In January , the University confirmed that the relocation of allied health and health sciences provision from Jordanstown to Coleraine would be paused to enable further consideration in the light of healthcare needs, the vision for transforming healthcare to meet those demands, the growing potential for the opening of the Medical School at the Magee campus and the University’s centres of excellence in teaching and research. The School of Health Sciences will remain at Jordanstown for the   academic year to enable sufficient time for transition arrangements to the new locations.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That was the beginning and in the same year, the South Derry League and Championship was initiated. Due to the effects of World War Two, the club dissolved but was reinstated in . From then until , the team played in fields belonging to the Bradley and Gribben families in the townland of Moneysterlin. After that, they moved to a field belonging to Annie and Hugh McCann of Longfield until . During this period the club continued their lofty ambitions and purchased land in Longfield which they converted into a playing pitch and have been based there ever since. The ’s saw the seniors win the junior championship in  followed by the senior championship in  and were finalists to Bellaghy in the Senior final of . Junior championship honours followed for a second time in . “They are massive markers in our history, from the very first team that ever represented the club in the s,” Pat Kidd added. “There are links to the present day. Thats what carries all clubs, there are links in the chain and you just keep building on them.” From then until now the club have contested seven intermediate finals , , , , , ,  but, while it demonstrates a level of consistency, they have yet to get over the line at this grade. The strong base of players helped them win seven intermediate reserve championships, since their first in . Development of facilities have been ongoing with the construction of the Gaelic Centre opened by President Buggy in August . The club Chairman at the time, Patrick Higgins, was a driving force behind the club and was a vital cog in the South Derry Board. Higgins sadly passed away in , but his legacy lives on through an U tournament the club began the following year. It remains one of the most established on underage club circuit with his family presenting the cup in his memory. The playing field was re-laid in  along with the building of the John O’Hagan Stand. Due to increased numbers of players and teams the club developed a fully floodlit training pitch in . They didnt stand still and the current developments display the commitment to the future. Camogie was prominent within the club up until the late s while Rounders was played during the s and s. “Big Andywas chairman of the club at that time and he tried to revive itin the seventies,” Kidd points out. Those in the area travel to neighbouring Ballinascreen for hurling and camogie. “We also had Paula McElwee, one of our lady footballers, playing for Swatragh in the Derry camogie final against Slaughtneil this year and she played very well,” he added. Patsy Breen is one of the clubs most famous sons, having played with Derry and Ulster with great distinction. “His father Eoin was on the first team we had back in . Patsy went on to be Derry Chairman with Brian Smith following in his footsteps more recently.” When Scór was in its zenith during the s and s Desertmartin were awarded on one occasion as the most participant club throughout the county. Desertmartin won many South Derry underage leagues and championships during the s, as the club began an underage coaching drive that built a senior team for the future. On the ladies football front, Desertmartin were senior champions in  and, like the mens teams, the more recent underage development has brought silverware. In , Desertmartin beat Ballinascreen to land the Derry A Féile and qualied for the All-Ireland Finals in Mayo. It was a wet night in Lissan, but the Desertmartin girls emerged county champions. “It was a bad night , but it was a great night for us,” Pat Kidd proudly states. “There were great coaching structures there too, just like we have with the boys. “The girls went to the All-Ireland and of all the ious  groups across all the Divisions, we played in Division . “Our girls were creating history on a daily basis with their results and performances and they reached the semi-final.” The Martins were grouped with Tyrone side Carrickmore and Mayos Carnacon, who produced the great Cora Staunton. “We were playing clubs from Dublin and Mayo and competing with the best and we were based in the foothills of Slieve Gallion,” Kidd enthused. Its all about Desertmartin. Boys or girls, it didnt matter. Even last year, the clubs executive committee of  was split down the middle – six men, six women. “Thats a sign of how wide a reach across the community,” Kidd said. “Wed be very keen to see that.” On the day the seniors began their championship run last season, Pats mother Mary and Mary Breen - who were also great friends - were both buried. Between them, they washed the senior kit for the past  years. The  season brought the club on the latest leg of their story, one that has been left in limbo. *** In , the club played at Grade A U level and four years later defeated a fancied Kilrea team to land the U Jack Cassidy Cup. It was a group that backbones the current senior team – Declan Murray, Connor Monaghan, Enda McGuckin, brothers Gregory and Paul McGovern. And, casting your eyes over Derry development, minor and school squads in recent years Desertmartin players are beginning to appear with more regularity. Lachlan Murray and Connor Shiels played in the Ulster minor championship with Derry last season and Ryan McEldowney is also on the . “Yes, its happening a hell of a lot more than ever, we have players involved in all of those teams,” Pat Kidd points out. “You have the girls in the camogie, we had a handful involved when St Colmswon the All-Ireland.” Last year, Desertmartin seniors, minors and Us qualied for their respective championship finals, only for them to be postponed due to the second wave of Covid- in October. After being relegated from the intermediate championship, following Derrys restructuring of the leagues, Desertmartin found themselves in the junior championship. “We got a wee inkling that a high profile playerwas showing an interest in managing the senior team, because of hisconnections with the club,” Kidd points out. The  Desertmartin senior  McKaigues Granda, Andy Shaw, was a former Chairman. His aunt Kate is married to club PRO Colm Breen. “As soon as we heard that we jumped on it and I rang him. He became the new manager and really lted the team and created a buzz with his name alone,” said Kidd who was full of praise for his input. They began to dig out results and he points to their semi-final win over Ballerin as the type of game they wouldve lost in the past. “People began to realise that he was the real deal, he wasnt asking you to do something he wasnt prepared to do or didnt do himself, Kidd said. “He was all in and a  percent man. The players bought in and him and Kevin ONeillbounced off each other. Before that, we wouldve had  or  out training. In the whole year last season, there were just short of  players turning out and that was just fantastic.” At reserve level, the team was in serious decline from the days they were winning titles regularly. With the rising numbers, fielding two teams was no longer a problem. “Its like the underage, where we have a great wee cohort of people. From the Us, Us and up to the Us, they deserve a mention, it is all a ladder and continuity”, said Kidd. “Then we have Ciaran Higgins and Danny Murray involved with both the seniors and underage, so there is a link there.” McKaigue has stepped away from management role, with ONeill staying on as manager. Kidd wouldnt be surprisedMcKaigue s to join him later in the year. But for now, his focus is on Derry and their promotion hopes. While the club remains in limbo regarding the unplayed finals of , Kidd is adamant that their foundations are strong. They have come a long way from the early branches of . “We are here for good,” Kidd said. “There are great people in the club and families who want to keep the thing going. “We have fantastic people working away behind the scenes, not wanting to be noticed. They do a lot for the club, so many people all shoulder to the wheel. None of the work around here wouldve been possible without them.” On top of their three finals, the club had the wheels in motion to officially open the newroom. “It wouldve been our fourth final of the year,” Kidd jokes. “In September, all was ready...we had a programme made out and invitations ready to send. “Being voted as Club of the Year in the paper , that was very appropriate for the efforts on and off the pitch. There is a phrase that not all the best teams are on the field. There is a good team in the community.” Whatever  brings, the people of Desertmartin have built and developed a club to direct them into the future.\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Desertmartin,cdp gaa awards ,Club of the Year\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In the recent County Derry Post awards scheme, Desertmartin were voted as Club of the Year for .

Michael McMullan spoke with their Chairman and club stalwart Pat Kidd to hear how the club is now thriving.Following the meandering Longfield Road, up from the village of Desertmartin, the snowy summit of Slieve Gallion makes for an impressive skyline.Eventually, on the right hand side, football posts emerge from the lush green countryside. A freshly made sign highlights the clubs support for the NHS during the current pandemic and tells a community the club is there for them.From grocery deliveries to pharmacy collections, the support is there with Chairman Pat Kidds number clearly visible. Welcome to planet GAA and how they fend for their own.The sign also advertises their new membership scheme – Club Desertmartin – with a motto that tells a lot.“Alone we can do so little together we can do so much,” it reads.Pat Kidd backs it up. After hanging up the boots, his love of GAA saw him give something back and he has stayed involved.He was a club referee, an underage coach and carried out all roles on the administration front. When asked how long he held the post of Chairman, he laughs. “Off and on, I have been Chairman, Secretary or Vice-Chairman for about  years,” he clears up.He points to the clubhouse and its surroundings. Its all for the families.“I always say the GAA is family and families stick together,” Kidd proudly says.Glens All-Ireland winning forward Enda Gormleys father Joe played with Desertmartin and was born and raised in the village. His uncle Pat was a club trustee. But the majority of their members hail from the countryside outside the village.“We touch Ballinascreen, Lissan, Moneymore and around to Magherafelt...and across to Lavey and Glen,” Kidd points out. “We reach all those areas of our catchment area.”Their membership grew to  last year, the clubs record in their existence. Its something that is music to any club, especially inthe foothills of Slieve Gallion where they dont have the luxury of an influx of housing.“Yeah, every club loves to see more members,” said Kidd. “There are not many houses and there is not much of a future for houses to be built here.”The club have made a case to the Housing Executive who have in turn asked for a declaration of interest from families wanting to locate in the Longfield area.“Thats what we are crying out for,” Kidd stresses. There is an ambition to grow their community.On arrival at Desertmartins Gaelic Centre, the newly developed extension is both fresh and welcoming.Built on the side of their existing hall and prestigiously refurbished dressing rooms, is a state of the artroom, with plasma TVs on the wall. There is a separate meeting room and a foyer area with the club crest and kits visible. It is the shop window of the club. First impression is everything and Desertmartin are making a statement of a club building for the future. googletag.cmd.push Desertmartins newroom “With our membership continuing to grow and with people looking more than football, we thought we would provide a social hub for the community,” Pat Kidd outlines.The motivation was to provide a centre for anything from fitness classes to birthday parties. “It is there for everyone to use. Our next phase would be to upgrade our gym facilities and that would be something we can look at further on,” Kidd adds.They sought funding from both Mid Ulster Council and the Department of Agriculture. On top of that, like any club benefiting from grants, they had to show their own commitment and put forward their own income.The community answered the call in the shape of silver and gold memberships, with monthly payments of pound and pound, to the Club Desertmartin scheme.“It was a serious effort by a lot of people,” Kidd stresses. Behind the words, his tone tells the full story of pride in what they have achieved.“As well as more new blood coming into the underage system via the local schools, we noticed increasing numbers coming to walk around the pitch.”A grant from Mid Ulster Council, coupled with the foresight to get the application made, saw a full floodlit walking provision with zero cost to the club. Even as our conversation continues, a couple of walkers are in their zone, striding along as part of their daily routine – proof of the clubs value.“There are people using this all the time. It is the whole community, even coming to walk their dogs and there in an overall social aspect to it,” Kidd adds.“There are initiatives like Every Step Counts or Ireland Lights Up, we sign up to them all the time and people get involved in them.”Those who founded the club would look down with pride on how their early seeds grew and have been nurtured.***In The Story of the GAA, published in  by Dr T O’Sullivan, Desertmartin was one of the first traces of the association, even before the formal competitions had begun.In chapter seven, OSullivan states that branches of the GAA were started in Desertmartin in , just after the association was founded in Thurles Hayes Hotel. googletag.cmd.push The first St Martins team to play in organised league fixtures in Derry, - BACK : M Hegarty, JJ Higgins, F Law, E Breen, T Hegarty, Master Hartnet FRONT : J Donnelly, J Hegarty, H Walls, F Cassidy, J McGuigan, L McGuigan A club was founded by Master McLaughlin, a teacher in Knocknagin in , wearing yellow jerseys with a Shamrock emblazoned on them. That was the beginning and in the same year, the South Derry League and Championship was initiated. Due to the effects of World War Two, the club dissolved but was reinstated in .From then until , the team played in fields belonging to the Bradley and Gribben families in the townland of Moneysterlin. After that, they moved to a field belonging to Annie and Hugh McCann of Longfield until . During this period the club continued their lofty ambitions and purchased land in Longfield which they converted into a playing pitch and have been based there ever since.The ’s saw the seniors win the junior championship in  followed by the senior championship in  and were finalists to Bellaghy in the Senior final of . Junior championship honours followed for a second time in . “They are massive markers in our history, from the very first team that ever represented the club in the s,” Pat Kidd added.“There are links to the present day. Thats what carries all clubs, there are links in the chain and you just keep building on them.”From then until now the club have contested seven intermediate finals , , , , , ,  but, while it demonstrates a level of consistency, they have yet to get over the line at this grade.The strong base of players helped them win seven intermediate reserve championships, since their first in .Development of facilities have been ongoing with the construction of the Gaelic Centre opened by President Buggy in August . The club Chairman at the time, Patrick Higgins, was a driving force behind the club and was a vital cog in the South Derry Board.Higgins sadly passed away in , but his legacy lives on through an U tournament the club began the following year. It remains one of the most established on underage club circuit with his family presenting the cup in his memory.The playing field was re-laid in  along with the building of the John O’Hagan Stand. Due to increased numbers of players and teams the club developed a fully floodlit training pitch in . They didnt stand still and the current developments display the commitment to the future.Camogie was prominent within the club up until the late s while Rounders was played during the s and s.“Big Andywas chairman of the club at that time and he tried to revive itin the seventies,” Kidd points out. Those in the area travel to neighbouring Ballinascreen for hurling and camogie.“We also had Paula McElwee, one of our lady footballers, playing for Swatragh in the Derry camogie final against Slaughtneil this year and she played very well,” he added.Patsy Breen is one of the clubs most famous sons, having played with Derry and Ulster with great distinction.“His father Eoin was on the first team we had back in . Patsy went on to be Derry Chairman with Brian Smith following in his footsteps more recently.”When Scoacuter was in its zenith during the s and s Desertmartin were awarded on one occasion as the most participant club throughout the county.Desertmartin won many South Derry underage leagues and championships during the s, as the club began an underage coaching drive that built a senior team for the future.On the ladies football front, Desertmartin were senior champions in  and, like the mens teams, the more recent underage development has brought silverware.In , Desertmartin beat Ballinascreen to land the Derry A Feacuteile and qualied for the All-Ireland Finals in Mayo. It was a wet night in Lissan, but the Desertmartin girls emerged county champions.“It was a bad night , but it was a great night for us,” Pat Kidd proudly states. “There were great coaching structures there too, just like we have with the boys.“The girls went to the All-Ireland and of all the ious  groups across all the Divisions, we played in Division . “Our girls were creating history on a daily basis with their results and performances and they reached the semi-final.”The Martins were grouped with Tyrone side Carrickmore and Mayos Carnacon, who produced the great Cora Staunton.“We were playing clubs from Dublin and Mayo and competing with the best and we were based in the foothills of Slieve Gallion,” Kidd enthused.Its all about Desertmartin. Boys or girls, it didnt matter. Even last year, the clubs executive committee of  was split down the middle – six men, six women.“Thats a sign of how wide a reach across the community,” Kidd said. “Wed be very keen to see that.”On the day the seniors began their championship run last season, Pats mother Mary and Mary Breen - who were also great friends - were both buried. Between them, they washed the senior kit for the past  years. The  season brought the club on the latest leg of their story, one that has been left in limbo.***In , the club played at Grade A U level and four years later defeated a fancied Kilrea team to land the U Jack Cassidy Cup.It was a group that backbones the current senior team – Declan Murray, Connor Monaghan, Enda McGuckin, brothers Gregory and Paul McGovern.And, casting your eyes over Derry development, minor and school squads in recent years Desertmartin players are beginning to appear with more regularity.Lachlan Murray and Connor Shiels played in the Ulster minor championship with Derry last season and Ryan McEldowney is also on the .“Yes, its happening a hell of a lot more than ever, we have players involved in all of those teams,” Pat Kidd points out.“You have the girls in the camogie, we had a handful involved when St Colmswon the All-Ireland.”Last year, Desertmartin seniors, minors and Us qualied for their respective championship finals, only for them to be postponed due to the second wave of Covid- in October.After being relegated from the intermediate championship, following Derrys restructuring of the leagues, Desertmartin found themselves in the junior championship.“We got a wee inkling that a high profile playerwas showing an interest in managing the senior team, because of hisconnections with the club,” Kidd points out.     The  Desertmartin senior  McKaigues Granda, Andy Shaw, was a former Chairman. His aunt Kate is married to club PRO Colm Breen.“As soon as we heard that we jumped on it and I rang him. He became the new manager and really lted the team and created a buzz with his name alone,” said Kidd who was full of praise for his input.They began to dig out results and he points to their semi-final win over Ballerin as the type of game they wouldve lost in the past.“People began to realise that he was the real deal, he wasnt asking you to do something he wasnt prepared to do or didnt do himself, Kidd said. “He was all in and a  percent man. The players bought in and him and Kevin ONeillbounced off each other. Before that, we wouldve had  or  out training. In the whole year last season, there were just short of  players turning out and that was just fantastic.”At reserve level, the team was in serious decline from the days they were winning titles regularly. With the rising numbers, fielding two teams was no longer a problem.“Its like the underage, where we have a great wee cohort of people. From the Us, Us and up to the Us, they deserve a mention, it is all a ladder and continuity”, said Kidd.“Then we have Ciaran Higgins and Danny Murray involved with both the seniors and underage, so there is a link there.”McKaigue has stepped away from management role, with ONeill staying on as manager. Kidd wouldnt be surprisedMcKaigue s to join him later in the year. But for now, his focus is on Derry and their promotion hopes.While the club remains in limbo regarding the unplayed finals of , Kidd is adamant that their foundations are strong. They have come a long way from the early branches of .“We are here for good,” Kidd said. “There are great people in the club and families who want to keep the thing going.“We have fantastic people working away behind the scenes, not wanting to be noticed.

There is a phrase that not all the best teams are on the field. There is a good team in the community.”Whatever  brings, the people of Desertmartin have built and developed a club to direct them into the future.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old, who helped raised more than poundmillion for the health service last year through a fundraising walk around his garden, died earlier today after contracting Covid-. The Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Brian Tierney, has expressed his sadness at the news. Adding his voice to the many who offered their sympathies to Captain Toms family today, Mayor Tierney said he had achieved a remarkable thing when he lted the spirits of the world with his kindness. googletag.cmd.push I was deeply saddened today to hear such tragic news, particularly as Captain Tom did so much to raise awareness of Covid and the pressures on the health service. His simple gesture of determination and kindness captured the imagination of everyone and inspired and united people in the fight against this terrible virus. Sadly, he has joined the many thousands who have so tragically been stolen from us. Captain Sir Tom Moore will always be remembered as a beacon of hope in the darkest of times, and an example to us all. I think it is only right that local people should have the opportunity to send their personal condolences and thanks to Captain Toms family, so I will open an online Book of Condolence tomorrow. googletag.cmd.push I think thathe is to have any lasting legacy it should be in the actions of every one of us as we protect those around us from the harshest effects of this virus. Please let us all remember Captain Tom, and in his memory always put the safety of others first and foremost in our thoughts. Further details will follow tomorrow on the Book of Condolence, which will be available on the Councils website atderrystrabane      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old, who helped raised more than poundmillion for the health service last year through a fundraising walk around his garden, died earlier today after contracting Covid-. The Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Brian Tierney, has expressed his sadness at the news. Adding his voice to the many who offered their sympathies to Captain Toms family today, Mayor Tierney said he had achieved a remarkable thing when he lted the spirits of the world with his kindness. googletag.cmd.push I was deeply saddened today to hear such tragic news, particularly as Captain Tom did so much to raise awareness of Covid and the pressures on the health service. His simple gesture of determination and kindness captured the imagination of everyone and inspired and united people in the fight against this terrible virus. Sadly, he has joined the many thousands who have so tragically been stolen from us. Captain Sir Tom Moore will always be remembered as a beacon of hope in the darkest of times, and an example to us all. I think it is only right that local people should have the opportunity to send their personal condolences and thanks to Captain Toms family, so I will open an online Book of Condolence tomorrow. googletag.cmd.push I think thathe is to have any lasting legacy it should be in the actions of every one of us as we protect those around us from the harshest effects of this virus. Please let us all remember Captain Tom, and in his memory always put the safety of others first and foremost in our thoughts. Further details will follow tomorrow on the Book of Condolence, which will be available on the Councils website atderrystrabane      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The highly-rated young striker joins Ronan Boyce in becoming a permanent member of the first-team squad ahead of the  season, which is now just a matter of weeks away. Derry City fans will remember Ferry from last season, during which the -year-old made his Candystripes debut. Ferry made two substitute appearances last season, his debut coming in a - home defeat to Sligo Rovers on July , and as a late substitute in the defeat to Tallaght in the penultimate league game of the season in November. He played  minutes in total with the first team. googletag.cmd.push The teenager is delighted to have signed his first deal with the club. “I’m over the moon to sign my first deal. I can’t thank the Academy enough for what they’ve done for me to get me to where I am now, as well as Declan, Paddy and all the boys in the first team,” he said. The belief is there from the manager and I can feel it every time I went into training with the first team last year. That’s all you want really, you want belief and faith in you to do well and hopefully I can repay them this year. googletag.cmd.push “As a footballer, most importantly, you have to have belief in yourself. I think I had a lot already before I signed the deal, but now that I have signed the deal, hopefully it gives me more confidence to try and push on this year.”  ‘Fully deserved’ Declan Devine described the contract as ‘fully deserved’ and paid tribute to the club’s Academy coaches who have helped the teenager develop in the striking role. “Our Academy continues to do a magnicent job and this is a compliment to them and also to Patrick who has put his head down and worked so hard.”     “We spoke with him and his parents last week and they are fantastic people.” “I’m looking for Patrick to take this opportunity to kick on now the way Jack Malone, Nathan Gartside and Ronan Boyce are doing.” “He can play anywhere across the front three and he has a very bright futurehe continues to work hard.” “Our supporters will see that we’re working to put down a solid base for the future of the club.” “These young players are the leblood of Derry City and I’m looking forward to working with them and watching them progress at the club.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased. We have known about getting the award for a while before it was actually made public knowledge, so it has been in the pipeline, he remarked.ldquoWe are very proud that what it represents especially is our work with community engagement. That is something we pride ourselves on here at Ballynahinch.ldquoIt is really special to have been awarded the prize this year especially. It has been such a tough year, for everyone, and for all sports clubs. It is certainly a nice little boost that we have been able to get this.James said the club was concentrating on getting the green light for action on the pitch to .ldquoThat is what everyone wants and what everyone is missing.

New showers, installed at a cost of pound,, have not been used, James explained.He said that before the current lockdown members were able to use their free time to make improvements around the club.ldquoWe obviously donrsquot have that at the moment, due to the current restrictions, he continued.ldquoIt was great to see how the people benefited from it. They certainly did seem to have their spirits lted.

It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK. We have been badly let down by all those that govern us. We should be equal to Scotland, Wales and England all of us members of the United Kingdom, but sadly now this is not the case.ldquoOne of my suppliers in England who contacted me last Friday thought there would be no problem supplying us but now the whole Northern Ireland and Brexit issue is a complete nightmare.The Horticultural Trades Associationis also lobbying the government, urging it to work with the EU to explore ways to ease the new rules.ldquoThe impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI, said the organisationrsquos chairman James Barnes, warning that the UKrsquos horticulture industry stands to lose outsolutions cannot be found..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Centennial.jpg","title":"Centennial celebrations event by Spa Wells LOL  ","story":"MEMBERS of Spa Wells LOL  kicked off their year long celebrations of the Centennial of Northern Ireland with a hike up Slieve Croob on New Yearrsquos Day.Crisp clear weather afforded enchanting views stretching to neighbouring Scotland and England.A poem was written to commemorate the occasion.On Slieve Croobrsquos lofty mountain peak:We placed our flag todayTo give a message to the worldThat we are here to stayOne hundred years have come and goneOur motto is the sameThe Union is our safeguardAnd this we will maintain.The members plan more exciting and interestingprojects throughout the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Student.jpg","title":"Cormac secures place at prestigious Harvard University  ","story":"A TEENAGER will be swapping Downpatrick for Hard University later this year.Cormac Savage is the first pupil from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School to be offered a place at the world famous American university.Seventeen year-old Cormac, who is head boy at St Patrickrsquos, says itrsquos a dream come true to be given an opportunity to study at what is regarded as one of the top universities in the world.Hersquos also grateful to his family and the teachers at St Patrickrsquos, including the principal, Mr Joe McCann, for encouraging him to apply in the first place.Hard is one of the fabled lsquoIvy Leaguersquo universities in the United States and Cormac was one of , students to apply for a place, of which only seven per cent were successful.ldquoWhile Irsquod always wanted to study in the USA, it wasnrsquot until a year ago I seriously considered Hard, he said.ldquoIt was always my dream university but I was convinced I wouldnrsquot get in.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives. Paying them would allow them to be able to support themselves.ldquoI am calling on the health minister to pay these nurses and to also increase the student nurse bursary as a recognition of the fantastic work student nurses are doing in the fight against Covid-..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 24%2C 2001  ","story":"KILLINCHY ndash The owners of a Killinchy factory, which could close its doors with the loss of  jobs, have this week been accused of playing mind games with staff.Trade union officials and shop stewards are furious with the owners of the Carpets International plant for their continued refusal to come clean about its future.And at a time when staff are unsuretheir jobs are secure, they have been asked by their bosses to increase their weekly productivity.A crucial board meeting planned for Bradford last week to discuss the Killinchy plantrsquos future role was cancelled at the eleventh hour and company officials have been accused of ldquohiding behind a wall of silence.More than  of the staff employed in Killinchy live in Down District and they believe their jobs could be on the line as the plantrsquos American owners press ahead with a major restructuring plan which will result in a number of its factories being downsized and closed.Workers fear the local plant will be axed in a bid to save costs amid claims that the parent company is poundm in debt.

He has performed the role of club chairman, with his playing reduced to part-time due to the fact he suffers from arthritis in a finger.He has played for Drumaroad in the past, and in more recent seasons for the former top club in Downpatrick, De La Salle.Back in the days of the Lecale Leaguersquos Spin magazine, which was edited by the late and sadly-missed Gerry Carson, Jim provided lsquoPeople in the Newsrsquo and lsquoAt your Servicersquo on a regular basis.This was back in the late s. Starting in  he produced another magazine named Equipment Plus.At this stage, he was running his Table Tennis Servicesfrom his home in Castlewellan. However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years.

Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world.

In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet.

That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who

Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was

Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been cancelled for the second year in a row.She said the March  events were normally an opportunity to celebrate the districtrsquos connection with St Patrick and the arearsquos important place in his the patron saintrsquos story.ldquoI know how disappointed many will be about this decision and I share their disappointment, said Cllr Devlin. ldquoHowever, the councilrsquos priority at this time is to continue to support the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic across wider society.She said that the decision to cancel was made in the best interests of residents, visitors, festival participants and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said they were looking forward to the  event going ahead.They said the local authority had to act to avoid any needless delay, warning that there was no way any festival parade could take place in the current Covid climate.Cllr Clarke said people needed to know that the parade would not happen, highlighting the continuing importance of protecting peoplersquos health.Cllr Curran said the event could not possibly have proceeded, given the ongoing public health emergency.He said the Covid situation remained ldquoextremely serious and that news of the parade cancellation would not come as a surprise.Cllr Walker urged council officials not to wait until the ldquoeleventh hour to pull the plug on the parade and hoped that next yearrsquos event will be one of the best ever.Cllr Burgess said current public health advice was clear, which meant the local council had no option but to cancel the parade, and urged council officials to start preparations for next yearrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Views.jpg","title":"Views sought on play park upgrade  ","story":"NEWCASTLE residents are being encouraged to have

He is an Irish’ president, so it is worthwhile recalling for President Biden just what America’s Irish heritage isConsequently it is worthwhile recalling for President Biden just what America’s Irish heritage is. If America has an Irish heritage it is fundamentally that of Ulster-Scotswho, like their fellows from England and Wales, established the American colonies to be free from Episcopalianrule. They sought freedom from the religious intolerance of Anglican and Roman Catholic hierarchies, the liberty to worship in their own way, something that Anglican and Catholic Episcopalian persecution denied them in Europe. It was this ‘dissenting’ tradition that became the basis for modern liberal democracy, something opposed by Rome in particular. And it was these dissenters who fought for American independence, whilst Catholics and Germans fought for the Crown.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Dr James Dingley is a Belfast based academic and chair of the Francis Hutcheson InstituteIndeed, in th century Ireland the government twice seriously considered arming Catholics to help put down Ulster Dissenters and their libertarian creed, leading many to flee to America.Further, the Universities of Hard, Yale and Princeton were all dissenter foundations, whose graduates played a major role in the American Revolution, Declaration of Independence and Constitution. All their ideals were heavily inspired by the Ulster dissenter and philosopher Francis Hutcheson, ‘Father of the Scottish Enlightenment’ and teacher of Adam Smith. Hutcheson’s works were core reading at American universities and for America’s founding fathers. It was Hutcheson who taught the right to rebel against unjust government and advocated the separation of church and state. For Hutcheson, religion should become a purely private affair, excluded from the public realm and discourse and advocated in Ireland .These dissenters constituted one of the three legally defined religious groups in th century Ireland and Britain. Protestant only referred to Anglicans, Dissenters were non-Anglican Reformation churches , whilst Roman Catholics constituted their own legal category. The latter two both suffered similar legal, economic and political disabilities . This gave dissenters a fear of episcopacy, since they were mostly tenant farmers under Anglican Protestant landlords and aristocrats, just like Catholics, whose Episcopalian hierarchy had also persecuted dissenters. This, unlike the Catholics, gave them a burning desire for non-hierarchicalself-government, inidual freedom of conscience and religion — the cornerstone of liberal democracy.Consequently, ‘Irish’ American dissenters fought against the British and Irish Catholics for Britain. In the s the burning issue in America was the fear of episcopacy, after Westminster had recognised a Catholic episcopacy in Canadaand George III sought to introduce an Anglican episcopacy into the American colonies. This was the dominating public debate behind the revolution, with Ulster dissenters to the fore in creating a liberal democratic America that Irish Catholics fought against. What America is and made her so successful was the fulfilment of dissenter ideals. If President Biden wishes to recognise America’s true ‘Irish’ roots he should visit Hutcheson’s home town of Saintfield, Co Down.• Dr Dingley is chair of the Francis Hutcheson Society——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

The earlier statement from Markethill also includes a reference to DUP minister Edwin Poots which is not included in the Portadown District’s statement on social media.\"Portadown District colour party with Drumcree church in the background. Picture: Freddie Parkinson Press EyeIt states: “The [Markethill] district further call on our fellow brother Orangeman, Edwin Poots, the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to immediately stop officials within his department from implementing the Irish Sea border checks.”In its response, Portadown District said: “The NI Protocol is an act of betrayal of the unionist community and our position as a sovereign part of the United Kingdom.“Portadown District is well aware of those elected politicians who voted for the Irish Sea Border, now is the time for you to apologise for your past actions and to pledge to do all that you can to bring it down, eventhat means disobeying your political leaders.”The statement goes on to call for “all unionist parties to take all necessary action to veto the implementation of EU laws through the Stormont Assembly”.\"DUP MLA William IrwinThe Markethill District comprises  lodges with a combined membership of more than .William Irwin posted his own response to the Markethill statement, describing the claim he supported the Irish Sea border as “untrue”. He said: “As an Orangeman of some  years, in the district of Loughgall... I am very disappointed by Markethill District Orange No ’s untrue claim. “I am absolutely at one with the many thousands of unionists across Northern Ireland who find the imposition of this protocol and its outworkings offensive and running contrary to everything we stand for,” he said.“I did not vote for the protocol nor have I supported it. To suggest otherwise is wrong, disingenuous and it would appear politically motivated.”Although the overwhelming majority of comments were supportive of the Markethill position, one reply said: “I was stunned to read the alleged Markethill District statement, andit is authenticated, they have seriously breached protocol for one and the duty of an Orangeman. I sincerely hope a retraction is publicly published andnot Grand Lodge need to step in.”In response to the latest Portadown District statement, one member said: “As much as I welcome this as an Orangeman, and it’s great to see, the only problem is it won’t make a dference until Grand Lodge publicly make the same statement to which I cant see them doing. I hope I’m proved wrong.”The Grand Lodge of Ireland has not yet responded to a request for comment.READ: Orange Order heartland rocked by bitter row over Irish Sea borderREAD: Lodge breaks ranks with Orange Order over New Decade New Approach dealA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!
