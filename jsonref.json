Now the West was terrified that another war was looming, and they had no way of knowing what the Red Army was up to.Amid this rising tension, American and British intelligence agencies came under pressure to find a new way to penetrate crucial Soviet communications.The answer they came up with was Operation Gold. The plan was breathtakingly risky yet ingenious: dig a tunnel into Soviet-occupied East Berlin and tap the landline communications which came from the Red Army’s headquarters.The tunnel would need to be 1,476ft long – 20ft longer than the height of the Empire State Building in New York – and extend under and beyond the heavily patrolled border.It would need to intercept a series of cables that ran almost parallel to the border, alongside a major road. The cables lay just 27 inches below street level, making the construction of the tunnel highly dangerous and open to discovery. Clearly, the entire project would have to be conducted in total secrecy. It was the largest covert operation the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) had ever undertaken.         Traitor: George Blake, who smuggled tunnel plans to the KGBBut there was an even more dramatic twist: they were betrayed, and the Soviets knew about the audacious plan before construction even began.The source of the leak was Soviet mole George Blake who, while working for the SIS, smuggled plans for the so-called Berlin Tunnel to the KGB.Blake, who was codenamed Agent Diomid, spent a decade passing Western secrets to the KGB and his torrent of information included, unforgivably, the names of other agents working for the West behind the Iron Curtain.In September 1953, Blake was working at Section Y, a new SIS office in London, where the focus was on the potential for tapping Soviet landlines. As a well-respected member of the team, Blake was trusted with its most high-level intelligence.One day in January 1954, he boarded a double-decker bus armed with confidential notes from an SIS-CIA meeting about the tunnel, and a sketch of the plans. Waiting for him on the top deck was KGB handler Sergei Kondrashev.Stunned by the material’s significance, Kondrashev placed it in his inside jacket pocket. Later he would describe how he ‘felt it burning into my chest’. It was explosive information but it left the KGB with a dilemma. If they attempted to protect their communications or even block the tunnel, Western intelligence agencies would immediately suspect a betrayal – and Blake would almost certainly be an obvious candidate.It meant, astonishingly, that the KGB chose to do nothing that would risk losing their most prolific agent. No one outside the KGB leadership was told about the tunnel or Blake’s role in its discovery. It meant Britain and the US were able to gather a treasure trove of intelligence on a scale never seen before.DIGGING began in Rudow, a remote corner of West Berlin occupied by the Americans, in September 1954. The operation had been three years in the planning by the CIA and SIS, involving precise calculations, practice digs and the construction of a large warehouse to hide the tunnel entrance and the 3,000 tons of soil that would be excavated during the dig.Construction equipment – including steel liner, a mini forklift truck and hydraulics gear – was coated with rubber to minimise clanking noises.Such was the scale of the tunnel that there was scepticism in Washington and London that it could be done at all. ‘No one had ever tunnelled 1,476 feet under clandestine conditions with the expectation of hitting a target two inches in diameter and 27 inches below a main GermanSoviet highway,’ a CIA history later noted.The team set up three six-man crews, digging by hand around the clock, each crew taking an eight-hour shift. They used army trenching tools – short-handled shovels normally used for digging foxholes. Complications were experienced almost immediately. The high water table in the area meant the tunnel had to be constructed much closer to the surface than planned, making it potentially easier to detect.Yet in February 1955, after just six months, it was complete.Now it was time to bring in ‘the Mole’ – an ingenious vertical excavator designed by a team of British Royal Engineers.Working from inside the Mole, the engineers could gently drill into the soil in the roof of the tunnel an inch or two at a time, delicately probing for the telephone cables above. After several tense weeks, the team uncovered the precious Soviet lines.This prompted the arrival of another crack team of British technicians from the General Post Office’s Special Investigations Unit, who had created a ‘tap chamber’ designed to amplify signals intercepted from the cables. Inside the sweaty, claustrophobic chamber at the far end of the tunnel, a ‘spur’ cable was painstakingly attached to each Soviet wire and fed to the amplifiers.Back in the warehouse, translators wearing headphones linked to equipment in the tap chamber listened intently.Suddenly, there was a voice.‘Da?’ the Russian voice asked.‘Tovarishch Polkovnik?’ a second voice replied – ‘Comrade Colonel?’The team had hit the jackpot.A message announcing their success was sent to London and Washington: ‘The baby was born.’It was like finding an oasis in the desert. Suddenly, the Allies had access to detailed information on the Soviet army and air force, weapons, equipment, plans, combat readiness, personnel, and military administration. An industrial-scale operation began to transcribe the 1,300 or so conversations being intercepted every day. Some, such as those which explained new call signs and enciphering procedures, were invaluable. But the most useful calls were those involving high-ranking Soviet officers experiencing problems with their telephones.SIS officer Peter Montagnon recalled: ‘All the normal caution – saying things in a code – would break down, and they’d just discuss what was going on in plain, straight-forward Russian. We’d hear more swear words than anything else.’Indeed, one of the biggest challenges for the translators was coping with the Russians’ astonishingly prolific and creative profanity.A glossary was created, labelled TOP SECRET OBSCENE.Many messages were either ‘dreary as hell’, as Montagnon put it, or mildly amusing, with the Soviets ‘largely talking about sex and the incompetence of their officers’.While some of what was gleaned was heartening, including military shortages and budget problems, other intelligence was troubling.The West learned that the Soviet air force in East Germany had improved its nuclear delivery capability and was armed with new bombers and jet interceptors with airborne radar.But bit by bit, a mosaic was being laboriously created of the Soviet order of battle.It led to the CIA quadrupling its estimate of the USSR’s production of radioactive uranium-235, and concluded the Soviets had the ability to build higher-megaton nuclear weapons.But, of course, the Allies weren’t the only ones keeping a secret. Soviet intelligence had little idea of just how many military, political, and scientific secrets were being lost. Nor did the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who was well aware of the tunnel’s existence.And so while the Russians continued to do nothing, concern grew as the months passed.Khrushchev was coming round to the idea of exposing the tunnel and pinning the blame solely on the Americans, seeing it as an opportunity to drive a wedge between the United States and Britain.It would support the Soviet narrative of the United States being the real obstacle to peace. With the Suez Crisis looming, he was keen to get Britain onside.In April 1956, his order finally came – and that Red Army unit was told exactly where to dig for those ‘damaged underground cables’.About 50 men lined the roadside of the Schonefelder Chaussee highway at 3ft to 5ft intervals in the middle of the night and began to dig down. The taps were disabled after 11 months and 11 days.The Allies considered blowing up the tunnel to prevent the Soviets coming through it, but, fearing the start of a war if Russians were killed, decided to do nothing.They felt sure the Soviets would suppress knowledge of the tunnel rather than admit that Western intelligence was capable of such a successful operation of this magnitude. But there was yet another surprise to come.Not only did the Russians announce the discovery of an ‘American spy tunnel’, but journalists were invited to go and see it for themselves. It was later opened to the public from 9am to 5pm seven days a week, with a free 30-minute guided tour. By October 1956, when Berlin’s most unique tourist attraction finally closed, some 90,000 visitors had toured the tunnel.reaction in the West was not what Khrushchev or the East Germans had expected.The US decided to say nothing, which was widely taken as an admission of responsibility.Western media mostly carried tales of admiration for the Americans’ pluck. Prime Minister Anthony Eden happily embraced the fiction that Britain had played no part in the escapade.SIS were instructed to maintain a tight lid on the country’s involvement. But behind the scenes, the CIA and SIS were conducting an urgent inquiry to determine whether the tunnel’s discovery was by chance – or whether the operation had been betrayed.For Blake, it was a tense time. However, analysis of the tapped conversations failed to reveal any indication that the Soviets were aware of the tunnel. He was off the hook – until the revelations five years later from a Polish defector, Michael Goleniewski, which finally identified Blake as a double agent. He was sentenced to 42 years, but escaped from Wormwood Scrubs in 1966 and made it to the USSR. He is now 96 and lives near Moscow.However, neither Blake’s betrayal, nor the tunnel’s discovery, prevented it from being among the most successful intelligence operations of the Cold War, long before reconnaissance satellites and other sophisticated systems were in use.Its 40,000 hours of telephone conversations continued to be transcribed for the next two years, and remained useful for the following decade.Perhaps the most valuable intelligence of all was evidence that the Soviets were not preparing to launch an invasion of Western Europe – crucial at a time when tensions between Russia and the West constantly threatened to spill over into a real, perhaps nuclear conflict.The information collected in the tunnel protected millions of lives, a benefit that can never be underestimated.© Steve Vogel, 2019Betrayal In Berlin, by Steve Vogel, is published by John Murray, priced £25.

There is wide agreement that the General Election, when it comes, will be determined by Brexit: 61 per cent say that the most important factor in deciding how they will vote will be \u0027getting the right outcome on Brexit\u0027.A total of 8,075 adults were interviewed online between September 12 and 17.  LORD ASHCROFT: The public\u0027s verdict on our political class? They waver between fury and contemptOn the face of it, the Government is in real trouble. The Supreme Court ruling against the Prime Minister follows a succession of parliamentary defeats, defections, expulsions and daily headlines about turmoil and chaos. But it is a good rule of thumb in politics that the noisier it gets, the more it pays to take a step back, a deep breath, and a good look at the bigger picture.My latest research, published today, looks at the fundamentals: how voters have reacted to the drama not just of the past few weeks but the years since the EU referendum, and how this week’s events fit into the longer story.For many people, and not just among those who backed Leave in the increasingly distant 2016 referendum, that story is one of frustration and failure – or, worse, deliberate actions to delay Brexit for as long as possible or stop it altogether.That is the context in which many see the Supreme Court’s decision. Many of the Brexit supporters we spoke to were not so much angered as bemused by the ruling: ‘They seem to have made up a law and found Boris guilty of breaking it,’ as one put it. More telling, for them, is who brought the case in the first place. ‘The people bringing these lawsuits have got money,’ one of our focus group participants observed. ‘It’s like they’ve got an extra vote somehow. They have their own interests and they’re not interested in us at all. Your vote, my vote is meaningless because it can be undermined by people of influence.’  They seem to have made up a law and found Boris guilty of breaking it Nor are they optimistic. While nearly eight in ten Conservative Leave voters agree with Boris that Brexit should happen at the end of October with or without a deal, only one in three think this is the most likely outcome. Nearly a quarter think we will end up remaining in the EU. This being the case, it is not surprising that among those currently leaning towards backing Nigel Farage, the most important attribute a party can have is not competence or even having the right priorities for the country, but that it does what it says it will do.This shows the possible reward – but the potential peril – of the PM nailing his colours so firmly to the Brexit mast. So far, on that score, Boris gets credit for battling on through the furore to uphold the referendum verdict.This comes not just from Tories, and some even told us they were surprised he had turned out to be so principled and determined. Six in ten Leave voters and most of those intending to vote Conservative say they would like to see him refuse to ask for an extension to Article 50 if no agreement is reached by October 19, despite the new legal mandate to do so.He trounces Jeremy Corbyn when we ask who would make the best PM – in fact, Labour Leave voters prefer him to the prospect of their own leader entering No 10. And while many Tory Remainers are nervous about the idea of a No Deal Brexit, they would choose this over a Corbyn-led Labour government by a huge margin, as would voters as a whole, by 48 per cent to 35 per cent.Thrilling though they may have been for constitutional scholars, then, the past few days have changed little in the Brexit debate. People on all sides feel just as strongly as they did before Lady Hale’s brooch became a national talking point. But the Election, when it comes, will be about more than whether and how we leave the EU. Those bringing lawsuits have money - it\u0027s like they\u0027ve got an extra vote ‘Dealing with Brexit in the right way’ certainly tops the list when we ask what people think are the most important issues facing the country. But when we ask what matters most to them and their families, it falls to third, behind the cost of living and the NHS. It is worth remembering that 2017 started out as the Brexit Election, but ended up being about everything else: social care, nationalisation, the NHS – even fox hunting – and the characteristics of the two leaders.There is also the perennial problem of the Conservative Party’s brand. At the last time round, many Labour voters simply could not bring themselves to vote for what they saw as the party of cuts however strongly they agreed with Theresa May that Brexit should mean Brexit. As my research finds, Tory-sceptic voters are taking Boris’s pledges of extra spending on health and the police with not just a pinch but a wheelbarrow of salt.All of these ingredients will go into the next Election, which in turn will not be a single national battle but a series of local skirmishes with each party having to fight on more than one front. Boris must keep Tory Remainers on board while bringing back those tempted by the Brexit Party Jo Swinson will see whether her Remain-in-all-circumstances position plays as well for the Lib Dems in the South West of England as it does in the South-West of London and Jeremy Corbyn’s policy of deliberate ambiguity will be tested to the limit in places as culturally different as Brighton and Stoke. Finally, there is the question of the voters’ stamina. Many Leavers see the endless delays as a campaign to wear them down, and some admit it is working. ‘I find myself going from anger to apathy really quickly,’ one told us.Though people hold strongly to their position and have their personal champions – whether Boris, Jo, Jeremy or Nigel – their view of the political class as a whole wavers between fury and contempt: many are torn not just between parties, but over whether to bother voting at all.It is a wearying saga, and we haven’t reached the end of it yet.Full details of Lord Ashcroft’s research can be found at LordAshcroftPolls.com"},{"url":null,"title":"Why Carrie Symonds conference outfit blue green","story":"Share this article In a further headache for party chiefs, Mr Johnson is now expected to jet to France on Monday for the funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died last week, aged 86.Unless he is forced back to London, Mr Johnson will deliver a keynote speech to 10,000 Tory delegates on Wednesday. "},{"url":null,"title":"Shocking moment huge explosion 25 000 tonne oil tanker South Korea sends mushroom cloud","story":"Share this article Fire crews tackling the blaze have largely extinguished it, port authorities have said. One official said: \u0027The fire has largely been put out but we are checking inside the vessels if there are any flames left or smoke coming out.\u0027Any impact on the terminal\u0027s output or the surrounding environment appears minimal for now as the ships were at the port for repair, he added.The Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the incident, officials said.

Although the work of the great Italian was popular in his time, an extensive new study of the artist to be published this week has outlined evidence that he was the butt of gossipy jokes in Renaissance Milan.Author Simon Hewitt has unearthed a little-studied image held in Germany, a “comic strip” design made in 1495 to illustrate a poem, that showed how Leonardo was once ridiculed. In one of its colourful images, An Allegory of Justice, a ginger-haired clerk, or court lawyer, is shown seated at a desk, mesmerised by other young men, and represents Leonardo da Vinci. “The identity of Leonardo as the red-headed scribe is totally new,” Hewitt told the Observer ahead of the publication of Leonardo da Vinci and the Book of Doom.“The comic-strip picture is in an obscure manuscript in Berlin and has never been consulted before by any Leonardo scholar.”The key passage in Hewitt’s book identifies the painter through a series of clues in the precious illustration. He is shown as a “left-handed clerk … with a wooden lyre at his feet: evidently a caricature of Leonardo da Vinci”. The lyre was Leonardo’s instrument and his father, Ser Piero, who is depicted resting his right arm on his shoulder, “is brandishing a sheet of paper that surely represents the anonymous document denouncing Leonardo for sodomy, deposited in a Florence tamburo in April 1476”.Red-headedness was rare in 15th-century Milan, but not unknown, and was regarded as freakish. Hewitt suspects Leonardo was descended from the Khazars, a Turkic people from the Asian steppe who scattered around the Black Sea and eastern Europe and had red hair. “As the 13th-century Arab historian Ibn Sa’id al-Maghribi put it: ‘Their complexions are white, their eyes blue and their hair flowing and predominantly reddish.’ ”Close study of the illuminated manuscript copy of Gaspare Visconti’s epic poem Paolo e Daria, revealed to Hewitt that Leonardo da Vinci is also likely to be the object of ridicule because of the absent-minded way he is shown to be drawing on the tablecloth, rather than on his sketch notebooks, and by his apparent fascination with a half-naked young man who is clutching “a rocket-like, Leo-invented contraption”.“Further evidence of Leonardo’s identity, and homosexual leanings, is provided by the group of eight strapping figures alongside,” argues Hewitt, who has conducted five years of research into Leonardo and his circle in search of the truth about a controversial portrait, La Bella Principessa. Along the way, he discovered the image from Visconti’s epic poem which also features a young blonde woman holding a pair of scales. Hewitt identifies this as Bianca Sforza, the daughter of the duke of Milan and the subject of the disputed wedding portrait by Leonardo da Vinci, completed a year later.The central argument of Hewitt’s new book is that Bianca is also the mysterious young woman in La Bella Principessa. He believes he can now prove that Leonardo really made this work. Since 2009 experts have clashed over its authenticity, with the self-confessed forger Shaun Greenhalgh claiming it was one of his.Hewitt tells the tragic life story of Sforza, who was later murdered, and explains why Leonardo’s portrait of her was included in one of the most lavish books ever produced – the Sforzida – considered to be “a book of doom”.Leonardo’s co-illustrator on this project, Giovan Pietro Birago, was paid even more than him. In tracking down this 15th-century evidence, Hewitt came across other illustrations made by Birago which deliberately poke fun at Leonardo. One Birago features a cherub committing sodomy. “As one of the few figures with ginger hair in Birago’s entire oeuvre, this is clearly a mischievous reference to Leonardo da Vinci,” writes Hewitt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14ab45e70b5553c16a868fa114a5d62096fdc74d/50_102_1998_1199/master/1998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84920c187134cec43baa9f57500124a6","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Forest fires in Indonesia, protests in Hong Kong, climate demonstrations and the World Athletic Championships – the past seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23cf24f246c8c30090341ec1cb79c64d29b296f/943_983_5343_3206/master/5343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0373749bd2c61e6db119b5df327d4672","title":"emergency cash german banknote designs in pictures","story":"During the first world war and the ensuing economic crisis, many German towns issued notgeld, or emergency money, to combat cash shortages.

Unidentified woman: “If they were reflecting the views of the people they would get on with it but I don’t think they ever will to be honest. It’s been what, three years, since we voted Out and we’re still waiting, they’re just sitting on their bums, in my eyes – just get out of Brexit would be the best for Britain.”Out of a limited, quickly executed and entirely unscientific sample of the limited, quickly executed and entirely unscientific vox pops to have littered the BBC’s recent news coverage, the above, from Aylesbury, is my favourite contribution. The Today programme’s news correspondent must, justifiably, have been hugging herself.It seems to be easy – though, admittedly, we never know how many were auditioned – to source people in markets who’ll say such things as “just get on with it” or “he’s doing a good job” or “judges don’t speak for the man in the street, do they?”. But to find, as Sima Kotecha did, the judicial ruling being so effortlessly conflated with “they”, the opponents of “the people”, with “bums” and “Britain” uttered in the same sentence – by someone who sounds annoyed, but not weird – must be the dream response to the presenter’s introduction: “So, how did that momentous supreme court decision go down among voters?”Fair dos: Kotecha indicated, as much as you can in a report featuring three anti-judge and two anti-Johnson contributions, that voters differ on its momentousness. Some will agree with the Aylesbury man – who was name-checked though not age-checked, according to a BBC vox pop rubric that is as mysterious as its treatment of opinion polls is transparent – that politicians “shouldn’t be able to break the law, it’s disgusting”.Then again, there was this from “a mother of one”: “He’s in charge of the country, the Queen sort of said it was OK for him to suspend parliament.” And if the Queen was misled? But we’d moved on.BBC vox pops rarely allow cross-cutting – or any other conventional measure of productive public discourse. In fact, this eager dissemination of unfounded, unchallenged, occasionally misleading or alcohol-misted opinion only contributes to the impression, reinforced by Question Time, that voter deliberation, if not actively redundant, is decreasingly a BBC priority, unlike the successive splats of tweet-like assertions. Hence, among the insights on parliament, on the World at One: “Don’t like the heat, get out of the kitchen, that’s their job innit?” Or, on Today, this Bexleyheath drinker on the judges: “That was in the paper today, that they’re all Remainers.”Debate itself can emerge as strikingly unpopular in these dodgy portraits of “the nation at large”, as Newsnight framed its package of star opinionators. Cross woman in Maidstone cafe: “It’s very frustrating, they’re just arguing and arguing and arguing and not doing anything, they’re just having a go at Boris.” Rarely can the Habermasian route to democratic consensus have been more compellingly demolished.The elevation of the five- or six-person vox pop has lately become insistent enough to suggest a BBC policy directive rather than old-fashioned laziness, economy, contempt or desperation. A new “pop-up newsroom” in Stoke, the UK’s most Remain constituency, was advertised by the BBC’s news director, Fran Unsworth, as “an important initiative, as we become more audience focused and change the way we gather news”. In practice, one of the pop-up’s many contributions, a weekday shopping-centre vox pop on the World at One, sounded remarkably similar to standard offerings: random, unenlightening, conducted at a time and in circumstances unfriendly to time-poor people, as bereft of under-18s (parental consent required) as it is of any claim to sociological significance, and for reasons of both convenience and disinhibition, anonymous.Woman on the unlawful suspension of parliament: “I don’t really think people on the top should really have that say, personally, he’s governing the country isn’t he and that’s what he should do, govern the country.” Next up, a man: “It’s just sheer madness, we’ve had three years…”Without formal analysis of the BBC’s vox pop output – just a voter returning the compliment – the impression that these are often unbalanced accounts of national thinking is supported by recent media scholarship. New research also shows “the direction of the vox pop viewpoint… has a direct effect on people’s personal opinions”.So, if this shambolic stuff is – whether for low, craven or visionary reasons – to be increasingly commonplace on BBC news and current affairs, the conflict between its traditional, informing ambitions and this form of mischief dictates some rapid adjustments to the editorial guidelines. Would it be simpler, in fact, to reclassify this sort of pointless improv as entertainment? Already, BBC rules look radically more permissive than in 2014. Then: “Vox pops are a tool of illustration, NOT a tool of research… Avoid terminology such as: ‘We’ve been out on the streets to find out what the people of Manchester think about this’.” Now, on The World at One, we’re introduced to “the view from Stoke”. A view that, as extracted and depicted by the BBC plays colourfully and, as above, influentially into narratives of the people versus parliament.It’s not as if we don’t know, from the case of Naga Munchetty, how much the BBC deplores any suspicion of partiality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58118c51853673ed6cf8f8e89c5b6b5df8718041/486_0_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5531b09b21bfdd2317ab711f9efdff56","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of brave","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘brave’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘brave’.Share your photos of what brave means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 October at 10am.

In 2003, she published her first book, the bestselling illustrated novella The Man With the Dancing Eyes, followed in 2007 by Playing With the Grown-ups. She has published three cookery books and in 2010 presented BBC Two’s cookery series The Delicious Miss Dahl. Her latest children’s book, Madame Badobedah, illustrated by Lauren O’Hara, is published by Walker Books on 3 October. I think we’ve probably watched this about 15 times and it never loses its appeal. It’s about Miguel, a young boy who dreams of being a musician. He ends up going to the land of the dead searching for his idol and meets someone who is connected to him. It’s incredibly original – a masterpiece of a film. I love the music, I love the way it looks, I love what it says. I want that to be how death is. I cry the same way every time I see it.Love and Trouble: Memoirs of a Former Wild Girl by Claire Dederer So good. It’s a memoir about growing up post-sexual revolution, pre-#MeToo and how the responses of the adults around Claire Dederer shaped her. So much is important: conversations around sex and consent and an adolescent’s right to explore their sexuality and potency without adults thinking it’s an invitation. It’s also funny and smart and very insightful about womanhood, sexuality and marriage. It’s a forensic examination of herself and her marriage, yet it doesn’t feel in any way icky, like she’s revealing too much. Its tone is really thoughtful and considered.I’ve been watching a ton of Ali Wong on Netflix. I love everything she does – there’s a fearlessness about her. I love how honest she is and her irreverence about motherhood, about sex, about working. The Baby Cobra special is totally brilliant. There’s this quote that really sums up her comedy: “Giving birth ain’t nothing compared to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is brutal. It is chronic physical torture… this savage ritual that just reminds you that your body is a cafeteria now. It don’t belong to you no more.”I’m always either listening to Hamilton, which makes me cry, or Giggs, who makes me laugh. I love Giggs’s humour, his lyricism – anyone who can put in the line “Shit’s Madagascar When the monkeys made a poo scatter” is my hero really. That’s from the song Baby, which is my standout from Big Bad....

She opens up about handling fame, Harvey Weinstein and the future of Bridget JonesNo one could accuse Renée Zellweger of not giving everything she’s got. Watching her portray Judy Garland in her new film, Judy, it’s as though she dissolves, molecule by molecule, into the role. Directed by the renowned British stage director Rupert Goold and adapted from the Olivier and Tony-nominated play by Peter Quilter, Judy is set in 1969, when Garland, 46, broke, fraught, separated from her children, did a run of shows at the Talk of the Town nightclub in London. Garland is depicted drinking, pill-popping, impetuously getting married, hanging out with gay fans, sometimes wowing audiences, other times getting booed. There’s Zellweger’s physical transformation with contact lenses and prosthetics, but it’s also in her insolent swagger over to the microphone when Garland is too drunk to perform. The slightly wild stare that begs you to look at her, but also implores you to look away. Zellweger even sings in character – live! A climactic hoarse rendition of Over the Rainbow is particularly poignant. With every gulp, twitch and shiver, Zellweger, starring alongside Michael Gambon, Jessie Buckley, and Rufus Sewell, makes it her business to be Judy Garland, and at times it’s almost painful to watch.It’s a turn that has generated much awards buzz. Variety magazine said: “Zellweger offers an all-singing, all-dancing, all-collapsing performance of a star at her lowest physical and psychological ebb.” At the recent Toronto international film festival, there was such an extended and rapturous standing ovation – one journalist later tweeting that she’d seen nothing like it in 15 years of attending the festival – that Zellweger eventually had to tell the audience to “quit it”, because her tears were “messing up” her makeup. While we Brits are hyper-aware of Zellweger from the Bridget Jones films, of course her resumé is far more varied than that, from her Girl Friday murmuring “You had me at hello” in Jerry Maguire (1996), to Roxie in Chicago (2002), where she proved she could sing and dance, to her spirited farm hand in Cold Mountain (2003), for which she won an Oscar, and, more recently, in WhatIf on Netflix – where she camped it up as predatory Anne Montgomery (think Barbara Stanwyck via Cruella de Vil). Now, with Judy, Zellweger offers a study in wrecked humanity – it wasn’t long after this film was set that Garland was found dead in her rented mews house in Belgravia following an accidental overdose of barbiturates.Asked about the differences between playing Roxie and Garland, Zellweger ticks off a list. “Live performance. Live audience. Real person. Person that I care about. Person who’s meant a lot to me and millions, through generations.” Judy is also about the cruelty of the old Hollywood studio system – with scenes showing the young Judy (Darci Shaw) being controlled, nagged about her weight, and started on a regime of uppers and downers that would ruin her for life. Zellweger says that thankfully there are stricter child labour laws these days. As to whether modern female performers are better off generally, she’s uncertain: “Because you see the Amy Winehouse documentary…”There seems a certain piquancy to Zellweger aiming to become a journalist when she must have often felt like media prey. Then again, Zellweger tells me that she usually has no problems wandering around incognito. She famously stepped back from screen-acting for six years in 2010, and thinks that helps her in the street. “Taking that time away, when you’re not in people’s consciousness, they think: ‘Oh yeah, she looks like somebody, maybe, but, um, who? I don’t know…’” Zellweger gives her distinctive throaty chuckle: “I sneak around really, really well.” She’s also good at being private, despite high profile relationships, including Jim Carrey, Jack White, a short marriage to Kenny Chesney, Bradley Cooper and, latterly, musician Doyle Bramhall II (just before I meet her, there are rumours that they’d split). Is she in a relationship? Zellweger laughs airily: “I’m in a million relationships!” She says she doesn’t find it difficult to have a personal life: “It’s not difficult at all. You just don’t talk about it, you don’t post it… I know it’s so boring when you’re trying to talk to an actress and she’s being all cryptic and whatever. But I like to keep it…” – she mimes a zipping action – “I just do.” It’s also about work: “It isn’t easy to be an actor who disappears when you have no mystery.” It’s a distraction when there’s too much of a public persona? “Yeah, I think a little mystery never hurt a girl.”I’d been wondering whether it’s partly about how roles such as Bridget Jones utilise Zellweger’s everywoman quality (warmth, approachability) – when people feel they know someone, maybe there’s also an element of feeling they own them? Whatever’s going on, Zellweger says it doesn’t “exist” for her, because she doesn’t read, watch, or in any way seek out what people are saying about her. She just ignores it? “Yeah, because there’s no upside to not ignoring it. I wouldn’t learn anything from it. It wouldn’t be helpful. What would I do? Explain myself? Or try to somehow mitigate a rumour that someone has started? It seems like a lot of wasted energy to me. I could just be with my dogs, or FaceTime my nephew, or work on writing something. That’s a lot of energy that you would just sort of haemorrhage. All day. On things that you can’t control anyway. And why would you want to?”One thing Zellweger did respond to was the Elle Woman in Hollywood awards furore, which could only be described as a global pile-on – for a while, it seemed like the entire world was accusing her of having plastic surgery. As it happens, the day I meet her, Zellweger looks exactly like herself, but that’s not the point – even if those 2014 photos did look unlike her, it doesn’t justify what she endured. Zellweger ended up penning an article for the Huffington Post, titled “We can do better”. She wrote: “Not that it’s anyone’s business, but I did not make a decision to alter my face and have surgery on my eyes” – but the article was about much more than that, debating everything from intrusion to women’s worth. To make sure I’m not putting words into her mouth, I double-check with Zellweger that she wrote it (she did). It’s not only an impressive, erudite read (the inner writer is on full beam), it’s also brave. “It just felt necessary,” she says. “I don’t know – was it really brave – if there’s no consequence?” She didn’t know that when she wrote it. “Yeah, I did, I did,” she says quietly. “What’s the worst thing that’s going to happen? What else could be said? How else could I have been made fun of? Or whatever happened… I know what that felt like, and I survived it, so what else?”Zellweger was also dragged into #MeToo. As part of the ongoing class-action lawsuit, actor Melissa Sagemiller claimed that Harvey Weinstein told her that Zellweger and Charlize Theron had given “sexual favours” for roles. There was a robust response from the Zellweger camp: “If Harvey said that, he’s full of shit.” (Though Zellweger says she didn’t personally put out a statement about it.) Regarding what Weinstein is alleged to have said about her, Zellweger says: “I did hear about that, yes.” Generally speaking, did Zellweger have any bad experiences in the industry? “Never directly in that way. But, you know, there were certain behaviours that I would tolerate because I had a job to do, and I was more interested in getting through the day than in correcting someone, certainly. They weren’t offences of the variety that you’re referencing. But there were certain languages and liberties that certain people would take. But they would take them from anyone, in my estimation, not just me as a woman. But I’m sure there were countless instances that I was not aware of – in terms of deals that were made and conversations that were had, that were derogatory, that I was not privy to. Sure. Of course. I’d be naive to think that I was immune.”Zellweger identifies as a feminist, and admires the women who came forward: “It gives you strength in numbers, doesn’t it? It enables you to, in some way, begin to heal.” She seems cautiously optimistic about changes in Hollywood: “I think it’s also right at this very delicate moment where there’s fear and so everybody is hyper-aware of the decisions that they make and what they say… It will be really interesting to see where it settles. But change is inevitable because there’s this new generation of women who are coming of age, and producing things, in every industry, not just Hollywood. They’re not waiting for permission because they don’t need to – and it never occurred to them that they needed to.”Considering the relentless nature of Hollywood, Zellweger’s six-year career break was a gamble. Was it a work-sabbatical, a fame-sabbatical, or a combination of both? “I needed to take care of myself,” she says. “It was more about being bored with myself, bored with my performances, and drawing on the same experiences, it just felt like regurgitated life, and I needed to collect some life experiences because the well was a bit dry. And I hadn’t grown in any way for years… It’s just redundancy. Because while the experiences were once-in-a-lifetime, dream-come-true blessings, there’s not really room for anything else. And I needed to learn something else. I needed to grow as a person. To grow up a little bit. And I needed to physically take care of myself… But I didn’t stop working, I still worked, just in a different capacity. I can’t be idle.” She has a work ethic? “Oh yes!”The interview is winding to a close. Does Zellweger have any reaction to the US political climate? “Every day!” Around the time we meet, President Trump has told four congresswomen to “go back” to the countries they originally came from (three of the four women were in fact born in America). Does this kind of thing concern her? “Every day,” repeats Zellweger. “Of course… It’s very upsetting. And it’s upsetting that it’s not as upsetting to as many folks as it should be.”Zellweger once spoke about suffering from impostor syndrome – could that just be a human thing? “Yeah, I’m pretty sure that’s a human thing. For most people… There are brain surgeons and whatnot who have to have a different kind of certitude about their skill.” Might it affect women more? “That we don’t feel entitled to whatever it is that we’ve worked for? That’s possibly true.” Stage fright ate Garland alive, and Zellweger tells me that she suffers from that too. Is that the negative side of creativity, the darkness of it? “The self-doubt? I suppose so. But it’s also a complicated mix of things when there’s an audience involved, when there’s…” –she adopts a melodramatic voice – “public humiliation looming.” She corrects herself, with an arch smile. “Potential public humiliation looming.” She shrugs. “You know, you just want to protect yourself.”Zellweger has the impostor syndrome under control now: “Not so much that I’d ever take anything for granted – that I’d ever sleep while I was doing something, lest I miss something,” she says wryly. “But it manifests a bit differently now. I can shut ‘her’ up a little more quickly.” Zellweger has won Oscars, Golden Globes, Baftas and more – it must get to the point of “Hey, I can do this!” Zellweger smiles, shifts in her seat. “I don’t really look it that way, I don’t judge it… I just look at it as – that was that moment, and now this is this moment… It’s kind of like education, I suppose – it stays with you. It doesn’t mean you should stop learning.”Judy is in UK cinemas from 2 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d8610becc06fe3103d2354def70ec893afd519b/0_389_5714_3428/master/5714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b2252ffbc0ab32b2c2485274e4b32af","title":"philip pullman i am a citizen and a writer","story":"He is a master of blending fact and fiction but, as Philip Pullman says, today’s politicians are on another levelI meet Philip Pullman 24 hours after he has got into trouble for idly musing on Twitter that he would like to hang Boris Johnson. “It was a silly joke,” he admits, looking slightly embarrassed as he enters his sitting room with a plate of biscuits for us, perching them on teetering stacks of books beneath which there is said to be a coffee table. He says his publishers were a bit miffed: threatening to murder the prime minister was clearly not how they had agreed to start the publicity campaign for his forthcoming children’s novel, The Secret Commonwealth, and Pullman had to publicly retract his words after there were complaints. “But,” the 72-year-old author adds, his tone brightening, while one of his dogs clambers on to his lap and the other maintains a vigil beside the biscuits, “the upshot was I gained 2,000 followers on Twitter!”Pullman creates magical realms in his award-winning fiction, writing it in his 16th-century farmhouse in a village outside Oxford, where he lives with his wife and his ukuleles and cockapoos and overflowing shelves. But if I expected to meet someone otherworldly, I was wrong. Pullman, who has two sons and several grandchildren, is very much of this world, and can talk in detail about the shadowy machinations of Dominic Cummings as well as the designs of Victoria Beckham and the woodworking videos he sometimes gets hooked watching on YouTube. His observation of the government is not one-sided: he tells me that Michael Gove, as education secretary, once invited him to discuss literacy. Pullman told him that “the basics” weren’t grammar and spelling, as Gove believed, “because everybody who’s got a word processor knows you correct those at the last minute,” but rather nursery rhymes, songs, a love of language itself. Nothing came of it, “but I’ll give him credit: he was very courteous and he listened, and there was a civil servant making notes. And Gove cracked a joke about me being ‘at the heart of the Magisterium now’, so he had plainly read my books.”It’s a decent joke, given that the Magisterium is the shadowy, authoritarian body that governs the country in Pullman’s two trilogies: His Dark Materials, which began in 1995, and now The Book of Dust, of which The Secret Commonwealth is the second part. His best-known character, Lyra, is the heroine of all of them. The first trilogy took her from age 11 to early teens. The second trilogy began with her as a baby, in a prequel, but now leaps forward to Lyra’s early 20s, when she is finally an undergraduate at Oxford, like Pullman was. Naturally, she is once again doing battle with power, sniffing out corruption and fighting it as David to the Magisterium’s Goliath.It is set in an unreal, almost British past, yet this book feels more consciously pegged to our present than the others. There are references to refugees landing on Greek islands and a character named Nur Huda el-Wahabi, after a schoolgirl who died in Grenfell Tower. (Her teacher won a bid in the Authors for Grenfell Tower auction to name a character in his next book and Pullman was very keen). Halfway through the book, Lyra explains what “bullshitting” really is, and, shortly afterwards, a character from the Magisterium is heard elsewhere telling someone that, “We should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once the people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.”I wonder if people such as Gove, Johnson and Trump, with their “fake news”, “had enough of experts” and Brexiteering narratives were on his mind when he wrote it.“It’s not really for me to judge,” he says, preferring not to tell people what to take from his work, explicitly, though “it might be the case”. He nods. “Inevitably, I am affected by the political background of the times, because I’m a citizen as well as a writer, and I’m interested in political news.”Pullman is more than happy to talk about politics in itself, though. He believes the EU referendum was “a terrible thing, a terrible mistake. Parliament is now not sovereign any more. It’s the will of the people that’s apparently sovereign, and this is terribly dangerous because the will of the people can easily be manipulated, as we saw in Germany. Dictators love referendums.”He lives in a Tory stronghold, where he has to vote Lib Dem, because a vote for Labour would be wasted, so he strongly believes in electoral reform. In any case, the thing that raises our current politics “from farce to tragedy is the lack of opposition from the Labour party. People say they elected the wrong Miliband. I think they elected the wrong Ed actually. Ed Balls would have been a marvellous leader. So that was a big mistake, and then saddling themselves with an electoral system that weighs it so much in favour of the trade unions. That’s populism again. If party leaders were elected simply and solely by MPs, we’d get a much better choice of leaders. But it’s also open to corruption of the Tory sort, where they’ve managed to franchise the choice of their leadership out to elderly members of bowls clubs. That’s all right, they deserve a vote too – but all of the vote?”Did he ever believe in Corbyn?“Corbyn is most at home on the back of a lorry with a microphone in his hand. He’s one of nature’s backbench rebels. He’s not at home in committee rooms making deals, agreeing with, making compromises. He’s not formed, by nature, to be the leader of a party, let alone a prime minister, and it’s an absolute tragedy that he’s now locked into it.”I’ll take that as a no, then. As for the prime minister: “Well, he’s a psychopath. Or he’s a sociopath. He’s born without the normal human reactions of shame, embarrassment, you know, all those things… He’s without them. He doesn’t mind who he hurts. He doesn’t mind whether he destroys the truth or not. In those respects, of course, he’s learned a lot from Trump that you can go into a high office of state and throw your weight around and break things, and nobody minds, or nobody manages to stop you. And the opposition is so helpless, so useless.”If Johnson does hold an election, Pullman suspects he will pitch it as “people versus parliament – and he’ll be on the side of the people. I mean, it’s just a joke – but he could do it and he could win and it’s terribly dangerous.”I mention that the first trilogy of Lyra books, in which children are taken away into camps and mistreated, stripped of their daemons (their animal souls), also feels prescient now, looking at the American border with Mexico.“I hadn’t thought of that,” Pullman says. “Gosh, I’m a prophet and I don’t know it. We’re living in very interesting times and there’s going to be a big crisis of some sort, isn’t there?”A TV production of His Dark Materials is coming soon to the BBC and HBO, starring James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Pullman seems reasonably interested when I bring it up, but points out that it’s hardly the first production of it. There were the stage plays at the National Theatre in 2003, then the audiobook, which he found “a bit disconcerting” because so many of the cast were from The Archers. Then the Hollywood film of the trilogy, which got cancelled after the first one, which was sad, because he loves Nicole Kidman and wanted to see her reach the stage of her character’s trajectory where she is “being overpowered by the love for Lyra that she couldn’t help feeling”. (He had written to Kidman himself to ask her to be in it. “But if the letter hadn’t worked, I was going to cross out her name and write ‘Dear Cate Blanchett’ instead.”)Disconcertingly, the new show’s American executive producer has issued a statement denying that Pullman’s stories are anti-religion, which is hardly accurate, but clearly something deemed necessary to assuage the Bible Belt, which raged about the movie and its anti-Christian devilry. I bring this up and Pullman sighs, gutturally.“America is an entirely different place,” he says. “We kind of fooled ourselves into thinking we can understand them.”Interestingly, though, the new book finds Lyra losing her way with magic and becoming something of a down-hearted rationalist. This takes us to the heart of Pullman’s paradox: that his books seek to undo the institution of Christianity while he remains steeped in its liturgical beauty and that he respects science so deeply that he uses it to furnish his impossible, imaginary worlds. The Secret Commonwealth ends, after 687 pages, with the words “To be continued.”“If I am spared to write the third book, all will be made clear, I hope,” he says, half joking, half not. After years of prostate trouble and surgery, and his wife’s own medical issues, he says that, “Neither of us is in very good health, and travelling anywhere or going out for long evenings are not really possible any more. But I don’t mind that a bit. I don’t want to travel anywhere.” Indeed, he researched some of the faraway locations in his new book, such as Istanbul, by strolling down the roads on Google Street View. I don’t know if he’s summoning all his strength to put on a brave face for the interview, but he does seem on excellent form today, making the tea, showing me round, giving me a lift in their car back to Oxford station.And, of course, there’s always Twitter, where he remains as lively as ever. “I got into terrible trouble a year or two ago because I said, in all innocence, ‘Look what is this quarrel between feminists and trans people? What’s the argument about?’”He claims, rather mischievously, that he still doesn’t understand the debate about whether gender can be overthrown biologically or socially, but I suggest it’s a relevant topic to his books, in which almost all children are born with a daemon of the opposite sex, who represents the other part of them, perhaps their soul. The daemon changes animal until puberty, when it takes a fixed form and the child finds out who they really are. It does make me think about the question of trans children and blocking puberty. He turns very thoughtful about this.“If I had a child, boy or girl, who felt passionately from an early age, manifestly that they were in the wrong body, I hope I would be understanding and as kind as possible,” he says. “What I don’t think I’d do is hasten them away to an endocrinologist. I know that if you want to transition, it is physically more plausible, or persuasive, if you do it before puberty, but is a child before puberty capable of… I mean the answer is, we don’t know, do we? We don’t know. The only thing we can do is to be as kind as possible.”A former teacher, Pullman is hugely interested in what we tell children and how we raise them. He is a fan of Michael Rosen, and believes that Kate Clanchy’s book Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me “should be in every single staff room”.He stopped teaching before the national curriculum even came in, “so I’m really speaking like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells when I talk about education now.” As for the literacy regime in primary schools today: “To regard the basics as being spelling properly, and not ending a sentence with a preposition, is a monstrous perversion of everything that’s right and true. Fronted adverbials? Nonsense. It drives me mad to think about them teaching that.”He has seen SATs tests where they say, “Spend 15 minutes making your plan and 45 minutes writing the story.” “When I used to speak to classes, I would say yes you must make a plan when you write the story, but write the story first and make the plan afterwards, because that way the plan will be exactly like the story and you’ll get more marks.”He’s not joking – this is how he does it himself. “It’s not doing it backwards. I call it doing it the right way.”We discuss the growing obsession in academy schools with strictness. He says that when he was at school, his teachers had been in the war, so weren’t going to be scared by a bunch of kids. “The French teacher had been on the Arctic convoys the geography teacher had driven tanks in the desert. The physics teacher, he was a brute, he’d flown Catalina seaplanes across the Atlantic.” When Pullman himself came to teach, he lacked their sense of authority, “so the only thing I could do to keep them in order was to tell them stories.” He also observed that every class already had a king and a queen who the other children looked up to, so if you sussed out who they were, and focussed on them for the first few weeks, the rest of the class would follow.We go outside to look at the decorative boxes he’s been making in his carpentry workshop, only to discover that the two cockapoos, Coco and Mixie, who look like designer doggies, but behave like feral beasts, have escaped. Some minutes later, after Pullman has set off down his acres of land to look for them, I find them in the next-door neighbours’ garden, having the time of their lives. We haul them back into the house and discover that they have also eaten the biscuits, leaving a trail of fallen books behind them.The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two by Philip Pullman is published on 3 October by Penguin at £20.

Why, then, is the US psychic industry worth $2bn a year? Deep in the night of 29 January 2012, Fatih Ozcan had an unusual dream. Then 27, and a waiter in a Turkish restaurant in York, Ozcan dreamed he was holding “loads of cash” while standing in front of his boss. When he arrived at the restaurant for his 5pm shift the next day, he was impatient to speak with his employer. “I was saying: ‘Where is he? I need him.’ I was telling everyone I had to play the lottery with the boss,” Ozcan says. After two hours of pestering, Ozcan’s boss agreed to play. Two days later, the winning EuroMillions numbers were drawn – the pair won £1m.“I’ve had loads of dreams that have become true, but they were little things, like travelling somewhere or having a nice day,” he says. Ozcan was certain this dream was prophetic and that he and his boss would win money together, because a month earlier he prayed for wealth for the first time. “My boss and my colleagues didn’t believe it, but I believed it and that’s why I pressured him for hours.”Every month premonitions hit the headlines – from the (ironically predictable) claims of Uri Geller to the countless celebrities who claim they foresaw 911 (including Michael Caine, Christine Lampard and Richard Madeley). Like Ozcan, several lottery winners claim they predicted their wins. In May this year, a man in Australia and a woman in Maryland both won the lottery by choosing numbers that they say came to them in a dream.That same month, a woman who lost her fiancé in the 2017 London Bridge terror attacks told an inquest about the moments before his death. Walking towards the Shard on the warm June evening, Christine Delcros suddenly felt uneasy as they neared the bridge and begged her partner to turn back. “We shouldn’t go there, we should go somewhere else,” she recalled saying. Tragically, her fiancé was the first of eight people killed in the attack.The Wikipedia page for “precognition” is unforgiving off the bat, the world’s most popular information resource claims premonitions are “widely considered to be pseudoscience”. This doesn’t change the fact that many of us have a similar story – a sense of unease before an accident, a familiar unfamiliar place, a disconcerting jolt of déjà vu.In 1967, Dr John Barker set up the London Premonitions Bureau to formally allow people to record their visions. It was the subject of a New Yorker article earlier this year. He collected many remarkable stories: shipwrecks, floods and tornadoes predicted in advance. A year after launching the bureau, two people even predicted the doctor’s own death – he died of a brain haemorrhage in August 1968. Yet 60 years later, the most accepted explanation of precognition is that we suffer from cognitive biases, retroactively seeking patterns to make sense of a senseless world. Still, like Barker, many continue to formalise the power of premonitions – and even hope to profit from the process.Dr Julia Mossbridge, a visiting psychology scholar at Northwestern University in the US, and co-author of The Premonition Code: How Sensing the Future Can Change Your Life, says there is an ever-expanding “precog economy”, where people with alleged precognitive powers sell their abilities to business people, law-enforcement officials and even health professionals.“People who are good at this can make money from it, and people who want the services can buy them for all sectors of the economy,” says Mossbridge, who had her first precognitive dream (about a school friend losing her watch) when she was seven. She says her so-called “positive precogs” (named after the mutated humans who predicted the future in the 2002 thriller Minority Report) differ from psychics with crystal balls and £1.50min phone lines. “What I’m imagining is a much more sophisticated and structurally supported version of that,” she says. “The UN could have a group of precogs who’d work on climate change alongside experts in the area. They’re just one mode of knowing.”Mossbridge’s dreams for a precog economy are undoubtedly ambitious, particularly as the scientific community considers precognition to be pseudoscience. “If I had to bet money on it, I would bet against the existence of these abilities based on my judgment of the currently available evidence,” says Professor Christopher French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths University. Yet French isn’t the one betting money. It is ordinary people who are paying precog businesses for stock market predictions and gambling tips. Mossbridge notes that psychic services have been growing since the recession and estimates the US psychic industry is worth $2bn. “Once precognition hits the higher-end markets – governments, investment banking – the estimates will go up by an order of magnitude,” she says.Daz Smith is a 49-year-old from Bath who works for an American business, CryptoViewing, to predict cryptocurrency trends. He says more than 20,000 subscribers pay a monthly fee (on a tiered structure starting from $1) to access insights from five precogs. Anyone can apply to work for CryptoViewing – to be eligible, you simply have to prove yourself by providing information about a faraway, unknown target the company sets.“The typical way I do it is I sit down at a table with a stack of paper and a pen, put my headphones on and meditate,” explains Smith. “It’s generally classical music, because it has no words and I don’t want to be influenced.” At the moment, Smith is listening to the soundtrack from the 2014 sci-fi film Interstellar. It takes him an hour to gather information. He says he sees “vague visuals” and feels snippets of emotions that he scribbles down on the page.Michael D Austin is the founder of Soul Rider, a California business that offers financial forecasting to clients. He assesses “signals” from his team of precog “viewers” in conjunction with traditional market analysis. “If eight people say the markets are going to go up and two people say the market is going to go down, you make a decision based on both experience and intuition.” His clients include inventors, stakeholders and entrepreneurs.“It’s been extremely helpful for me,” says Andrea Driver, a 50-year-old from Sacramento who has been using Soul Rider’s services for a year. Earlier this year, Austin advised her against purchasing a piece of land for her business – it later emerged there were permit issues with the location. “Having him tapping into that, precogging that, was very helpful.” It is easy to be sceptical of psychic claims. At one point during our call, Austin says he has “a feeling there’s a reason you opted to write this story”. Er, yes, I say sheepishly, I was commissioned by an editor.Both Austin and Smith also say they don’t want to use their powers to become millionaires themselves. Yet Caroline Watt, a parapsychologist at the University of Edinburgh, says studies have found a “small” but “statistically significant” precognitive effect in humans. “I know that sceptical scientists would argue it is not possible to look into the future, therefore it is obviously nonsense when a study claims a positive effect,” she says. However, Watt says there are some well-controlled studies that are hard to explain. She cites a 1989 meta-analysis of 309 “future-telling” studies conducted on 50,000 subjects between 1935 and 1987. The analysis concluded that “evidence for an overall effect is strong.” In 2016, researchers from the University of New South Wales found that “non-conscious emotional information” enables us to make better decisions – in short, intuition exists. If it’s accepted we subconsciously gather hidden information from our surroundings, is precognition a possibility?Despite this evidence, Watt warns that people shouldn’t put much stock (or shares) in the precog economy. “I would say it is a form of gambling because, although there may be a tiny effect, it’s not something of much practical use. The odds might be 1 in 1,000. I wouldn’t bet my house or my health on that.”Mossbridge is an optimist. While she agrees with Watt’s “small but statistically significant” framing, she believes further research is needed. “Scientists never used to be able to study meditation, because it was seen as too ‘woo woo’, but then people meditated and reduced stress, so now studies get funded,” she says. “That’s the way it always works – science is the last to jump on the bandwagon.”If science is last, then the military is first. Many precogs don’t just look into the future, Smith and Austin both use a technique known as “remote viewing” to explore distant targets in the present and the past. In 1995, the CIA declassified documents related to a secret army project, Stargate, that spent $20m researching remote viewing for 20 years, from the 1970s onwards. The files concluded that “remote viewers can be used as collectors in conjunction with other intelligence sources”. A major success came in 1976, when a remote viewer named Rosemary Smith found the location of a lost Soviet spy plane (in 1995, former president Jimmy Carter confirmed the incident had taken place). Yet Ray Hyman, a psychology professor tasked by the CIA to evaluate Stargate, wrote of consistent methodological problems, concluding there was little evidence remote viewing worked, let alone that it was useful in intelligence operations.Gail Husick, 55, is a former partner in a law firm who founded a remote-viewing agency in Washington in 2014. Among other things, the Husick Group has helped the police with missing-person cases, found a lost passport, searched for stolen art and advised an entrepreneur on technology patents. Fees begin at $3,000.Tim O’Brien, 61, is a Microsoft employee from Seattle who was adopted as a child and employed Husick to help find his birth mother. Over several months, Husick produced a 25-page report that O’Brien says gave “very, very intimate” details about his mother that she later confirmed to be true. O’Brien says these details include the fact that his mother worked in a mercantile environment and is very short, and that O’Brien’s conception was non- consensual and distressing. “I’m a firm believer that it wasn’t just lucky guessing.” O’Brien found his mother a year after Husick’s report – but not because of it. “They tried to pinpoint the town and were inaccurate,” he says, adding this “caused an unnecessary side-track” in his journey. Yet he has no regrets, and recommends remote viewing to others. “I think it’s a valuable tool.”Husick offers to conduct a remote-viewing session for me. I choose a location – a small hut-like pagoda on the northwestern corner of Nami Island, a micronation in South Korea where my boyfriend proposed to me earlier this summer.Husick used 13 remote viewers for the task and then sent me her report. I was initially unimpressed by the results. The viewers saw “a curved structure” that resembled a pit or an amphitheatre, there was reference to tiered seating, and Husick’s report mentioned a tunnel, mine, or shaft. “There is a sense of intense desire, danger, threat, aggression and competition associated with the target location,” the report reads, somewhat insultingly.When I tell Husick the viewing failed, she is unperturbed. “I understand your initial reaction. Most people expect us to be like psychics in the movies and the reality is that our work is much more painstaking,” she says. She explores Nami Island on Google and finds several consistencies with the viewers’ visions. She points out that several viewers spoke of a tower-like feature near the target location – a zipwire runs from the mainland to the island. The report shows that Viewer 12 saw “multiples of human males rappelling downwards suspended by rope-like cords”. Husick adds that, although I didn’t see it, there is cascaded seating on the island – in a garden area – and it’s adorned with flags, just as one viewer drew. She explains that if I were a real client, multiple sessions would have been undertaken, and this report is just a “first pass” at the target.Husick considers our session a success I remain confused. The viewers’ results are over 200 pages long. For every result that makes me gasp (Viewer 12 drew a structure that looks remarkably like my pagoda), another dampens my mood (one viewer saw an “industrial wasteland” and “urban decay” – the island is lush and green, and peacocks wander freely).Should I put stock in Husick’s consistencies? Professor French says a cognitive bias known as “subjective validation” means people consider information correct if it has personal value to them (he notes that no one is immune and, thanks to his career, he himself has a vested interest in being a sceptic). “How do we know that those correspondences didn’t just occur by chance? In 200 pages, there’s bound to be elements that match any location you go to,” he says.Yet Mossbridge argues it’s still a growing business. “There are more and more people who are building applications of this work. Some are legitimate and some are not, but they’re getting customers who are buying their work for reasonable and sometimes exorbitant prices, which means that the sceptics are not winning.” It’s worth noting that those who do buy into the precog economy don’t like to publicise the fact. Austin, Husick and Smith all say that police forces who work with them prefer to keep quiet about it, and Austin believes the precog economy will have to stay on the “downlow” as it expands. “It scares people,” he says. “It scares the hell out of them.”Winning the lottery after a precognitive dream was the least remarkable part of Fatih Ozcan’s story. The waiter only found out he’d won nine days after the draw, because his boss kept the ticket and refused to halve the winnings. After protracted police proceedings, Ozcan took him to court. It was a distressing time – telling the story makes his voice shake. “People were telling me I had no chance of winning the court case,” he says. Yet midway through his ordeal, he received reassurance in the middle of the night. “I had another dream showing me I would win the case,” he recalls. After a week-long trial in 2014, a judge ruled that Ozcan should be given his £500,000 share."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ab7f134ffead3efe9e0026708a83ae63d56fe24/0_1864_3421_2051/master/3421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15594c8d5eba8e6f0cce75f70b36679d","title":"otomoto collaboration to make ordinary things pleasurable","story":"Artist Ryan Gander and creative director Tony Chambers want you to love doing the dishes and enjoy using wall hooks. Their new venture OTOMOTO tries to make mundane objects pleasurable. The first product: a kitchen sink…This is not the sort of sales patter you get at Magnet, but then conceptual artist Gander is known for his ability to theorise everything from household goods to classical sculpture, so big ideas about kitchen sinks were to be expected. To be fair, he has a point. As he moves around his creation, sitting in the middle of his studio in the village of Melton in Suffolk, he explains its system of changeable shelves, chopping boards and containers, and you can see how, yes, it would change the way you work in the kitchen. Arrange it right and you can do all your food preparation and washing in one place. If Gander contributes nothing else, he may liberate us from searching for the chopping knife.The sink is the first product released by Otomoto, the “lifestyle venture” Gander recently founded with Tony Chambers, former editor-in-chief of Wallpaper*. “Otomoto” is a Japanese word meaning, loosely, “close at hand” and the idea is that all the company’s wares (“everything and the kitchen sink”, they quip) should be convenient, ergonomic and make ordinary things pleasurable. “It’s about elevating the mundane,” says Chambers, who has also come down to the studio. “And taking pride in the most everyday details.”“Otomoto things should enrich your life,” Gander says. “We’re really into the idea that if you do something boring like washing up, it shouldn’t be boring. It should be joyous.”In the 20 years since Gander graduated from Manchester politan University with a degree in interactive art, he has produced work ranging from painting, sculpture and architecture to lectures, customised trainers, typefaces, children’s books and new words. He’s interested in the way objects act as vessels for people’s stories, but he’s just as happy talking about commonplace creativity as art.Art for him is about experimenting with ideas and “trying to make some original contribution to human history and human knowledge, like an explorer”, but he thinks the way people are usually creative “is things like bumper stickers, the clothes we wear, what we serve when friends come round for dinner, or what we post on social media”. Some of his best work, such as his plaster sculptures of his nine-year-old daughter’s dens, takes that sort of creativity and recasts it as something that can be shown in galleries. In a way, Otomoto reverses that process, taking the kind of conceptual thinking you might associate with artists and applying it to everyday stuff. Meanwhile Chambers, a well-connected player in the design world who transformed Wallpaper* from a magazine to a multi-format media brand, has a creative input into the goods, but also knows how to present them as products.The next release, when the company officially launches in February next year (on the second, because the date, 02.02.2020, is symmetrical), is unconfirmed, but likely to be either a poker or a collection of wall hooks. Gander leads us to an office where he retrieves the poker prototype from one of his staff. It is stainless steel, hollow, so you can blow into the fire to stoke it up, and designed with a magnetic clip so it can attach to a base. The second idea (which one assumes would sell somewhat better) developed from Gander’s hobby of collecting hooks. He says he has hundreds – “Hooks from the Pound Shop, hooks from Margiela, hooks that aren’t even seen as hooks” – and would like to offer an Otomoto set comprising 95 readymades and five by artists they would commission. Owners could use them how they want, but Gander and Chambers like the idea of whole walls of hooks, a complete installation of a collection.Gander has a selection of 30 or so hooks installed in the hall of a guest bungalow outside the studio, so he and Chambers take me over for a look. As we stand contemplating them, I wonder aloud if Otomoto is really just a fancy homewares company, but they say no, their things don’t have to be designed for the home, in fact they don’t have to be designed objects at all. An Otomoto product could be a book or talk or an experience they create for people. In other words, as they freely concede, it’s a bit like the old Factory Records practice of giving a catalogue number to everything relevant to the organisation, from record releases to merchandise, a bar and even a cat, to show that everything about the Mancunian company was a creative experiment.The big question is: are we meant to see Otomoto sinks, pokers and hook collections as “art” or “design”? Unsurprisingly, the answer is complicated. The pair don’t like the idea of producing things that would be marketed as “design”, because Gander thinks well-designed, functional objects aren’t made to be art, because they’re not given a meaning by their maker. The mistake people make, he says, is assuming art involves the highest or hardest kind of creativity, when it can in fact be quite easy. “Everyone thinks there’s this creative ladder and that artists are at the top of it. But they’re not, because the highest form of creative ingenuity by far is problem-solving. Being creative is waking up every day and starting with a really difficult problem that needs solving, with a budget and health and safety requirements restricting you. That’s design, and that’s why good designers are way more creative than artists.”He points out that there’s a history of overlooked artists, such as Brazilian ecologist Victor Papanek, who had turned from art to the more interesting challenge of solving functional problems in the real world. That tradition inspires Gander and Chambers, if only for the obvious reason that, in 2019, it seems more admirable and creative to make something that helps people than to be “some arrogant, narcissistic artist character that gets pissed on telly, shouts and makes stuff that looks kind of frivolous and wasteful, do you know what I mean?”I do, but I still think punters buying the hooks might like to know whether or not they can say they’ve got an artwork on the wall. “Well, I consider art to be about belief and associated value. Our products are only art objects depending on the belief system you instil in them.”Do he and Chambers instil them with a belief that they’re “art” or “design”?“Well,” Chambers says, in a smooth way that makes you think he must be extremely good at business meetings, “the primary motive for all Otomoto products is for them to be good useful design, and to make rudimentary tasks that bit more pleasurable. So design first and foremost. But we fully understand that they can also be appreciated and relieved of their function, purely for their formal and visceral qualities.”Those qualities will not include a uniform style. Chambers and Gander both groan at the way a lot of modern designers beaver away at a signature look, with similar pieces of work released at regular intervals. “A designer shouldn’t have a style,” Chambers says. “You should be solving a problem that requires a certain material or a certain approach.” He thinks it happens because people want to consciously buy into a defined lifestyle Gander, on the other hand, blames the internet. “Social media has changed art colossally, and not in a good way. It’s made things more retinal and less cognitive. I think in the next few years, the art world as we know it might split into two worlds. One will be cognitive, and the other will have art that functions well in places like Instagram, such as Kaws or Banksy. You know, people like to see things they recognise, so you have a high ratio of artists who repeat themselves. I don’t think that is creative endeavour, though – I’m more interested in trying stuff out and making all these mistakes. That’s how you get to things that are really good.”Ten miles from the studio, at Gander’s home in Saxmundham, we see his sink in action. He has a stainless steel prototype (the retail version is Silestone) sitting on a wooden frame beside the cooker hob, with paulownia chopping boards at the cooker end and at the other a colander, draining rack and thin gastronorm container for compostable waste. An upper lip holds the boards in place, while a lower lip can hold various containers. The sink also has a really good plug: just a rubber ball on a chain that rolls down the sloping sink-bottom to settle in the plughole on its own. Gander moved to Suffolk from London 10 years ago, when his wife Rebecca was pregnant with their first child, Olive. They bought “for a pittance” a dilapidated Victorian building that had been a B\u0026ampB and set about remodelling it a decade later it is almost complete, all airy, cool and restrained, with a few hidden artworks built in ($25 and €30 coins from the future glued to the floor, a bubble-less spirit level embedded in the stairs). The showpiece is the living room fireplace, a replica of one designed in 1955 by Josef and Anni Albers, the German artist couple who taught at the Bauhaus before emigrating to the US in the 30s.The Albers fireplace is something of a cult object. Believing that brickwork could be used as a sculptural element in homes, Josef used off-white firebricks set at different angles to create a geometric relief. He made only two, for private clients in the US, but Ryan asked the Albers Foundation for permission to make a copy, and their granddaughter Lucy agreed, on condition that they could send historians to look at it from time to time. It is the only one in Europe, and has on one side a brass plaque crediting the Albers. A local bricklayer made it: “He really enjoyed doing it,” Gander says.The studio, a former radio factory on a lane behind a tractor dealership, was bought around the same time as the house and is where Gander makes most of his art – or rather has ideas and gets other people to make them. Using a wheelchair means there are some physical tasks he can’t do, but in any case, he says, he isn’t all that good at actually making things – his skill lies in making things happen. The sink was made with the help of Matheson Whiteley, a London architectural studio, and Cosentino, a Spanish materials supplier.For the last few years Gander has been trying to get an art school going for kids who are being pushed out of the system. When he was young, he became interested in art after being taken to Tate Liverpool on school trips, and went off to university in Manchester. “Rich kids weren’t interested in making art then. Now that’s changed, and kids from poorer backgrounds find it harder to go. When I visit art schools, I always sense that the kids from more difficult circumstances want something more – there’s more drive, because there’s nothing to fall back on, it has to work. They’re bolder and they take more risks. Which is good, because risk-taking works really well in the art world.”Gander has had plans drawn up for a shipping container structure that could house the school, but thinks that in a way it already exists, “as a state of permanent optimism, ambition and enthusiasm”. That state is evoked on his website for Fairfield International, as he plans to call it, which consists mostly of a loop of inspirational slogans, such as: “Because art education as it stands kills your buzz,” “Because you don’t have a trust fund or a wealthy spouse” and, “Because you want to make art more than you want to be an artist.” Fairfield International could be anywhere, but it does feel very Suffolk. In some towns here, if you randomly chucked a pencil it would hit an art person – probably one who has moved out of London. Glenn Brown, Maggi Hambling, Sarah Lucas, Sadie Coles, Stuart Shave and Norman Rosenthal, among others, all live here then there are all the publishers and nature writers trundling off to contemplate the Fens.It was through this creative community, at a children’s birthday party in Saxmundham, that Gander and Chambers ended up talking about Otomoto – Chambers lives in the Barbican in London, but has a holiday home in one of the much-coveted California-style bungalows designed by great British modernist architect John Penn and built in Suffolk in the 60s. Gander thought Chambers, knowing about the design world, might be able to help him sell the sink. Chambers was sceptical because at Wallpaper*, he had people pitching him ideas about conceptual furniture all the time. His first thought was that “there were enough kitchen sinks in the world, to be honest”, then he couldn’t believe that no one in Europe had thought of the close-at-hand idea before, and finally he found himself taken with “the philosophy and approach”. Back at the studio, Gander and Chambers catch up on work, the latter revealing some of the typefaces he’s had made for Otomoto. Both men love them because the faces make the letters perfectly symmetrical (like the launch date), which means, to their font-nerdish delight, that not only is Otomoto a palindrome, but it can also be read in a mirror.While this is happening, Gander’s mother appears. She and his father moved to Suffolk from Chester a year ago and like to help him out today she is dropping off a denim jacket on to which she has been sewing patches of corporate logos, a prototype for one of his projects. As he examines the patches, he and Chambers discuss whether or not youth style tribes have been supplanted by identity politics (Gander dislikes the latter, and never ticks the disabled box on forms because he doesn’t identify as “someone in a wheelchair”). As they adjust their clothes for the photograph, they talk about the effect they would like Otomoto to have. “It’s not just about commercial success,” Gander says, “It’s also about – I know it sounds cheesy, but inspiring people. When I was a kid, I just buzzed off people who made loads of work that was all really different. I was, like, ‘I want to do what they do! I want to get up and do something completely different every day, and try something out!’ Because that’s what’s great about the world, isn’t it? There’s so much you can do.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/088cfdf5b1541a47eb61fcb98c817ffab49e9bf4/0_90_1858_1114/master/1858.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=346ee02f86262b01ff1b1ff9742af736","title":"why romcoms have all the answers film eva wiseman modern love","story":"Whether it’s making the grand gesture or the daily grind of enduring love – romantic comedies always have a way of pointing out some essential truthEverything I know about love I’ve learned watching romcoms backwards. Running away from airports, closing the window on a boy busking in the rain, a woman putting her hair up and her glasses on – these are the lessons I have realised a person needs, lessons in listening to someone when they tell you they’re choosing another life, lessons in boundaries, lessons in comfort and the lies of femininity.A video went viral last week – a man holding up Love Actually-style inspirational signs to his wife, who was very extremely in labour. He’s always been her “biggest fan” the signs say, and their relationship full of “prayer and patience” and although there have been “rough times” and a lost pregnancy, there’s no test that they can’t overcome together. The feelings you get as you watch the video are shockingly similar to actual labour pains – the same combination of aching horror and existential fear. And it highlighted the danger of another romcom trope, the grand gesture, which turns all focus on to the gesturer, turning the gesturee into an interchangeable object, an audience to their own life.Another option is to turn the romcom off 15 minutes before the end. Before the car chase of romance in which a man and a woman (they could never be friends because sex exists!) fall into each other’s kiss to the sound of a million violins melting. It’s this trick, stopping at the last ad break, that transforms the classic What Women Want from a saccharine love story into a comic reflection on gender, self and mental illness. Except, who wants to learn from beautiful people?The problem with romantic comedies is not their tropes, which merely illuminate the issues. It’s that so many obscure the point of the love story, which at its best uses the shadowy terror of loneliness in all its modern iterations to explore the possibility of… being known.But for all my aged understanding of the value of love and respect and companionship over the quick thrill of romance, the rewound romcom being a cosy reminder, I know its lasting lesson is that there is added value in a love affair that starts with a schtick. The lure of romance retains its tingle, even when it appears inspired by romcoms, rather than the other way round.Eight years ago my friend Martha wrote a piece for a women’s magazine, challenging her brother, best friend and boss to fix her up on a blind date. Reading it now, it remains utterly charming – there she poses, head tilted, the perfect heroine, beside a line-up of potentials. And reader, she literally married one. Every time I think about it I grin.As a kind of middle ground between fizzing romance and everyday fondness, I have high hopes for Modern Love, the long-running New York Times column that has been adapted for TV, starring Tina Fey and Anne Hathaway. These are short stories about real relationships – popular columns include one about a woman who used exotic animal-training techniques on her husband, another about a dying dog and the memorable You May Want to Marry My Husband by Amy Krouse Rosenthal, who had ovarian cancer. It was a dating profile for her partner of 26 years days after it was published she died. To dip into the archive, over a decade of stories, is to open time capsules of what love was, and what obsessions we brought to it, and what was acceptable, or possible, or true. While there are fewer airport dashes, the peril is often real, albeit hidden in such places as a loaf of bread.There is already a podcast, which glamorises the franchise as actors read them as monologues, “stories of love, loss and redemption”, but it manages to retain their next-door-ness, their low yet razor-sharp stakes. In Modern Love, unlike romcoms, the nuance of romance is often articulated through the players’ anxious interactions with technology. This being the huge barrier for the modern Hollywood love story and one that sends producers racing to parodies – with mobile phones nobody is a stranger, communication is constant and intimacy is assumed. I adore the columns for two reasons, which unfortunately appear to be mutually exclusive – their domestic banality and their exoticism. Exotic in that the banal is articulated with honesty we rarely hear from friends, and which I often find myself choking on, as if on an unexpected olive stone.The glory of the romcom, whether littered with grand set pieces or the scratching reality of pain and boredom, is that it gives strangers’ voices to our deepest desire, which is to know and be known, and then, to make that thirst funny. To coax this fear out on to a screen, to light it beautifully and then let it slip on a banana peel, in part so as not to make us cry forever. Long dismissed, the romcom has suffered many deaths, but written well and watched rebelliously, it not only teaches us the basics of love, but the power of connection. Watched backwards you end with a white girl in a kitchen, wanting more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6f568c13094cd776472ab6f907c9040d7b3c630/1240_569_4594_2757/master/4594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a9e1d7a6095717cacded5ddc0a6ac75","title":"maximalism amazing technicolour dreamboats","story":"Clashing patterns, rich fabrics, baroque accessories – the maximalist home breaks all the rules"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59884f26adcbf1a424168c1d9d40e4cdbbc6afed/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8f7e4deefeacff8006e5b849691712e9 960w","title":"designer es devlin all the worlds her stage","story":"Es Devlin, the 48-year-old British set designer, is often asked where her ideas come from. These ideas – “stage sculptures”, she calls them – might take the form of the ingenious revolving glass box that encloses the performers in director Sam Mendes’s production of The Lehman Trilogy, transferring to Broadway next year after a sold-out run in London’s West End, or an outsize replica of Miley Cyrus’s tongue that the singer slid down on her 2014 Bangerz tour. Or it could be 200,000 pieces of mirror fixed by hand on to columns for a Louis Vuitton runway show or a pair of hands 25m high emerging from Lake Constance in Austria, tossing playing cards in the air for a production of Bizet’s Carmen.So, yes, ideas, ridiculous ones, lots of them. At first, Devlin tried to answer these inquiries honestly. Most of her ideas, she would reply, come just after she has woken up. She loves that moment when she’s lying in bed, in a totally dark room, maybe jetlagged, and the only light is the faint edge round the curtains. There’s something very stage-like about it. She sets an initial alarm – “a very gentle one” – then a proper one, to allow for 20 minutes of meditative dozing. “It’s a lovely liminal space,” she says. “You can really luxuriate in what your mind would be like if you didn’t have to do anything. It’s really important.”The problem is that people really hate this answer. “They almost want the, you know, map coordinates,” she goes on, laughing. “‘Where are the ideas? Come on! Don’t fob me off with some bullshit about sleeping.’”Devlin being Devlin, she has come up with another, more evocative answer. “I picked a space, which is a corridor,” she explains, as we sit in the garden of her house in Dulwich, south London. Devlin recalls that she spent a lot of her childhood in corridors. First of all, she has “a really big mouth”, which meant she was always being kicked out of class. Second, she’s very smiley, and this infuriated her teachers even more: “They’d go, ‘Esmerelda, wipe that grin off your face!’” Now, looking back, Devlin realises that corridors can be magical places. She might hear snatches of a physics class in one room, some poetry from another, a music lesson taking place down the hall, teachers having a gossip. “But I’m the only person who’s listening to all of that together,” she exclaims. Then she stops: “The next thing is just not forgetting it.”People tend to find this response a bit more satisfying.Over 25 years, Devlin has established herself as the world’s most influential set designer. She began in theatre – via a degree in English literature from Bristol University and a foundation course at Central Saint Martins – and it’s here that her impact has been especially profound. When she started out, theatre felt like a dying art form: predictable, staid, classic texts played for audiences in their dotage. Today it feels vibrant: a place where you switch off your phone (a radical idea), sit with other people (even more challenging) and experience entertainment that, when it’s finished, will exist only in the memories of the people who were there. Some of Devlin’s most notable stage sets include Benedict Cumberbatch’s Hamlet at the Barbican in 2015, a witty, clinical take on American Psycho at the Almeida and the National Theatre’s 1998 revival of Harold Pinter’s Betrayal. (On opening night, Pinter was doing a meet-and-greet and said, “Have you met Es Devlin? She wrote the play.”)Devlin – who is petite but strong-looking and today, as she often is, dressed head-to-toe in black, an exact match for her hair, which is knotted in a bun – thinks her job as a set designer in the theatre is to find “little chinks in the armour of the brain”. When she gets it right, complex ideas and even archaic language suddenly make perfect sense to an audience. “You get these tiny opportunities where people relax enough to feel that everything is familiar and they can follow the story,” she says. “We all know that feeling when we go to the theatre and we’re either relaxed knowing we’re in good hands, or anxious because we’re in crap hands and it’s going to be a shit night.”Devlin’s theatre work led organically to designing sets for music shows. A turning point, she acknowledges, was when Kanye West saw images of the stage set she created with the Chapman brothers for the British post-punk band Wire in 2003. This led to Devlin and West working together from 2005 for almost a decade, including on his 2011 Watch the Throne tour, where West and Jay-Z stood on giant LED cubes on to which images and lights were projected. She created the set for Adele’s first concerts for five years in 2016, spent two years on U2’s Innocence \u0026amp Experience arena show and somehow managed to bring an 80ft animatronic human figure to life for Take That.All of these set designs are technically dazzling, but Devlin is adamant that her work should never overshadow the performers. She also hopes there’s a coherence in thought and process in everything she does. “Moving between genres,” she says, “you can see there’s a spinning cube that might happen at the Serpentine Gallery, it might happen at the National Theatre and it might happen on a Beyoncé stage. People never really, not recently anyway, come along and say, ‘I want one of these.’ It’s more, ‘Here’s the music, this is the day of the show, let’s begin.’”In recent times, though, a significant change has taken place for Devlin. For most of her career, her job has mainly been to bring someone else’s vision to life. But now she’s coming in earlier in the process and as an artist herself. Mendes is collaborating with her on a play that hasn’t even been written yet: the visuals are just as important as the words, if not more so. Likewise, Abel Tesfaye, the Canadian R\u0026ampB artist known as the Weeknd, has brought in Devlin long before his fourth album is completed to establish how the stage set for his tour will look. Devlin’s also been asked by Pitzhanger, a country home in west London owned by the architect Sir John Soane in the early 1800s and reopened this year as a gallery, to make a sculpture there. Hers will be the second show, following Anish Kapoor’s.“It’s been the secret plan all along,” Devlin whispers theatrically, about these new projects that place her firmly at centre stage. “No, it wasn’t a plan. You just grow. What I’ve noticed is that you get to a point in your practice and you radiate that, and then people pick up on it.”We meet in the afternoon, at 4pm, and Devlin’s already been to Paris, had a meeting with Nicolas Ghesquière, creative director at Louis Vuitton, and come back. Now, she talks for more than two hours without remotely flagging. There’s a story that, while she was in labour with her second child, she was simultaneously sending plans to the singer Shakira – I ask her if I’ve heard it right, though I suspect I know the answer.Devlin insists she has slowed down now: partly because of her children (she has two, a daughter Ry and son Ludo, with her husband Jack Galloway, a costume designer), and partly because of where we’re sitting. The family bought their house in 2016 and Devlin says she is especially besotted with the garden: it has a woodland feel with plants flowering over the spring and summer like “a slow-motion fireworks display”. The only indication that we’re not deep in the country are the gentle pock-pock of tennis balls from the club next door and a beep-beep-beep of train doors opening at a nearby station. Devlin says that when a new project comes in, she decides to take it based on whether it excites her enough to leave her children and her garden behind.Devlin’s design studio is based on the ground floor of her house in two soundproofed rooms. She usually has between eight and 10 employees, mainly women, including teachers from the Bartlett School of Architecture and the Royal College of Art, dotted between props and prototypes from previous projects. The studio is currently home to around 15 projects at different stages of development. Top of the list when we meet in July is the Pitzhanger commission, which has just opened. “They said to me, ‘Do whatever you want,’” she recalls. This, it turns out, is a dangerous thing to say to Devlin. She came back and said that she wanted to fill the gallery with a sprawling map. “But it’s not a map of the world in any recognisable way,” she clarifies. “It’s a map that charts, in my subjective opinion, each moment of major perspective shift in the course of our species.” She roars at the ridiculousness of what she’s saying. “So a minor ambition then.”Some background might be helpful here. When she was six, Devlin’s parents moved the family from Surbiton in west London to Rye on the south coast. “They went for a romantic weekend on the advice of my Auntie Pru and they bought a house, which was a really dumb thing to do because they hadn’t sold their other house,” Devlin says. “But anyway.” One of the landmarks of the town was a handmade, 1:100 scale model of Rye in Victorian times, complete with sound and light effects. The Story of Rye was made by a local couple – a retired teacher and an electrical engineer – and had a voiceover, Devlin recalls, recounting pertinent historical facts in “this terribly cheesy actor-y voice”.If only by repeated exposure, Devlin became mildly obsessed with this model. So when Pitzhanger called, she wondered if she might do her take on it. Again, Devlin being Devlin, the stakes have been raised exponentially. Her tour of the major “perspective shifts” in history will start at the beginning of time and go through to today, finishing on the shores of Bangladesh with the tides rising. Along the way, there will be nods to cave paintings, the period of Confucius, the pyramids, Nicolaus Copernicus’s Frombork tower, the Enlightenment, the trenches of the second world war, the street where Rosa Parks took her seat on a bus, Cape Canaveral and Cern.The work – which is not remotely complete when we meet – is, Devlin accepts, hard to explain. “I have demonstrated it with a quarter of a lemon and two mirrors, that might be the easiest way,” she muses. “The room is rectangular, so you are in this squashed elliptical. It’s effectively like being inside a rugby ball.” Devlin hopes that the room, which will be all white, will be a space for contemplation of where we’ve got to as a species and especially the damage we are inflicting on the planet. But it will also be an intriguing, unsettling experience to just stand in. “The curator, John Leslie, said, ‘Es, you do a lot of telling the story. This is an art gallery, you are coming in to make a sculpture, allow people to find it. And you’ll leave it open to so many more interpretations.’”As for what’s next, Devlin knows what she’s doing until 2023. There’s Mendes and the Weeknd, she’s designing the UK Pavilion for Expo 2020 in Dubai, she is writing her own theatre piece and has projects with the choreographers Wayne McGregor and Akram Khan. It’s exhausting hearing Devlin just run through her to-do list – presumably she’s not taking on anything more, I ask. She smiles mischievously. “If the context is not inviting, I say no, which is a lot of the time. Or the context might be inviting, but my brain is full. So then I just say, ‘Let me go to sleep. Let me see if I wake up in the next few days with any way of doing it and I’ll tell you what it is.’”Es Devlin: Memory Palace runs at the Pitzhanger Gallery until 12 January 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e93fe5fce939a91ba478b84e94d2fda02406660/0_761_1363_817/master/1363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dac3c6c24e09758ca114a50820d809df","title":"meet the inventors who want to upgrade your life","story":"Words by Olly Wainwright, Kate Jacobs, Nell Card, Mark Hopper and Johnny DavisIn the centre of Brussels stands a huge warehouse brimming with lampshades and doorknobs, marble slabs and school chairs. Nineteenth century solid oak doors from Antwerp City Hall lie on one shelf, while floor tiles from a postwar office block are piled up nearby, next to row upon row of ceramic toilets.“Forestry in the city” is how Belgian architect Maarten Gielen describes the work of his practice, Rotor Deconstruction, where the wood isn’t from living trees, but harvested from condemned buildings. “Every year, each Brussels resident creates over half a tonne of construction waste, while we import about the same amount of new material,” he says. “We’re trying to connect the two streams.”Architectural salvage may have been around for centuries, but Gielen’s firm is trying to kickstart a radical shift in the way architects and builders think about construction, designing for reuse from the beginning, and changing people’s perceptions of the value of secondhand materials. With global construction waste estimated to double to 2.2bn tonnes a year by 2025, most of which ends up as landfill, they are calling for an urgent change in attitudes to the life of building components, and a move away from recycling towards reusing. Rather than crushing expensive paving slabs for rubble in foundations, as usually happens, why not keep the value of the material in its original form?Founded as an architectural collective in 2005, Rotor have built an international reputation for their provocative research projects and exhibitions, which often expose the hidden forces that shape our material environment. They curated a warts-and-all monographic show on the work of Rem Koolhaas’s firm, OMA, at the Barbican, which included models scavenged from the bins alongside walls of client correspondence. For the Venice Biennale, they displayed worn carpets and chipped handrails from various Belgian municipal buildings as if they were precious relics. Their unlikely decision to set up a demolition company came in 2016, after years of frustration with what they saw as the architecture world’s lazy approach to “sustainability”.Operating as policy wonks as much as architects, Rotor approached the Brussels regional government and convinced the politicians to commission them to produce a new waste management plan for the region, which they crucially reframed as the “material” management plan. The response was enthusiastic, but change was slow to come. “It takes a long time to make legislation,” says Gielen, “so we decided to get on with it ourselves.”The first building they tackled was the former headquarters of Levi’s jeans, full of partition walls framed in pale tropical hardwood, which they sold quickly and cheaply from the site, not realising their true value at the time. Now, their warehouse inventory ranges from steel keyholes for 50 cents to a pair of solid bronze doorhandles from a noted bank interior for €1,750. The work began as an incredibly labour intensive process, but, as time has gone on, the team have perfected their methods. For ceramic tiles, they now have a series of baths of biological acid that eats away at the mortar, leaving them looking as good as new and ready to lay. They recently dismantled a 1930s nursery school in Leuven, where each room had its own beautifully tiled floors, which the developer is now planning to incorporate in the new building, while other projects range from the vast World Trade Centre towers in Brussels, from which they’ve prised out Carrara marble tiles and slick 1970s light fittings, to relocating the entire structure of a former horse-riding arena to be reincarnated as a waste sorting plant.It might sound like novelty “upcycling”, but Rotor are adamant that such repurposing must move from being a fringe pursuit to mainstream practice. As the planet hurtles ever further towards climate catastrophe and a future of depleted resources, the forgotten art of careful deconstruction is more important to relearn than ever before. When Lauren Bowker broke her back as a teenager it left her  looking for ways to articulate the pain she was living with. That set her on an extraordinary path, working with new materials to show what can’t be seen. “I’ve always wanted to tap into my curiosity and to see the world through a new lens,” she says.Bowker followed her chemistry degree with a master’s in textiles. But what makes her approach truly unorthodox is that she combines rigorous scientific research with a personal interest in magic and the occult. “For me that just means banishing rigid thinking and fusing many different approaches – science, the natural world and artistic expression – to make seemingly impossible, fantastical things a reality,” she says.Five years ago, Bowker founded The Unseen, a materials innovation company which develops molecules that change colour, whether in response to heat, light, pollution, pH level, friction or pressure. “I’m revealing to the world what the eye cannot see,” she says. She and her team then apply these molecules in a range of fields, from purely artistic endeavours to fashion and beauty – with erse collaborators including Estée Lauder, Formula 1, Virgin Galactic and Swarovski, for whom she created a headpiece of lab-grown gems that changed colour according to brain activity.“Skin is the barrier between the outer and inner person, it’s alive and changing all the time,” she says. “I’m not interested in using beauty as a mask but as a way to express ourselves.Co-director Zoe Laughlin’s role at University College London’s Institute of Making is, she explains, to oversee a hands-on symposium celebrating all aspects of materials and processes. “Making for me is defined as the relationship between those two,” she says. “We are material enthusiasts, who love what you can do with stuff.”At the heart of the Institute is the Materials Library, where samples of powders, beads and lumps are stacked. Adjacent is the workshop of lathes, potters’ wheels, 3D printers. “The materials and tools are inextricably linked,” says Laughlin.She describes the remit as one of inter-disciplinary, practical learning, where anyone enrolled at UCL can come in and play – “but play seriously – and trust that interesting things will happen.”The idea is that knowledge can come from anywhere. “Within a university the ultimate is the peer-reviewed paper or book – written knowledge,” she explains. “But there is knowledge that comes through the experience of doing.”She cites how surgeons back up teaching with hands-on practice, literally asking medical students to “hold this, squeeze this, see how it feels”. She encourages interaction between departments and allows anyone to drop in and experiment. “You could work part-time in the library or be a professor of nautical engineering – you’re all welcome. You never know who’s going to walk in.”Laughlin explains how she might approach the subject of “sharpness”, by bringing together a physicist with a butcher and a hairdresser – “And I guarantee the hairdresser will say something the physicist has not thought about.”She encourages visitors to push tools to the limit. “We try to make people feel at ease with breaking things because then you’ve done something interesting with it.”There’s one firm rule though: “No weapons and no assholes.”Her latest project is the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub which, she says, is about “bringing together the right people and saying, we’re not going to have all the answers, but this problem isn’t going to be solved without working as a team.”Laughlin comes from a farming family which has given her a grounded way of viewing the world. “I remember having conversations where my grandpa would say, ‘Now Zoe, when you’re 50 you need to chop these trees down … ’ When I’m seven. It’s a different perception of material responsibility. I’m trying to push for engineers, product designers – people responsible for making – to think of themselves as materials farmers. You come at it with a sense that there’s a 50-year responsibility around this object, and you have to pass that on.”The twins combine backgrounds in adventure sports (where they ran ultramarathons across arctic and Amazon) and advertising (where they ran award-winning accounts for Adidas and Airbnb), to make high-tech sportswear that draws on neuroscience, psychology and storytelling, and is as popular with extreme athletes as it is with Silicon Valley. Their Solar Charged Jacket – whose phosphorescent membrane can absorb light from an iPhone, or any source – was named one of Time magazine’s Best Inventions of 2018.With no advertising or wholesale – their shop is their website – Vollebak’s biggest problem is keeping things in stock.

One of the materials she singles out is called malai, a substance made from bacteria in coconut water. Sourced from farmers in southern India it’s a byproduct of the white flesh harvested from coconuts. The water ferments in vats for two weeks, during which time a sheet of cellulose jelly forms. Mixed with natural fibres and resins, this jelly can be manufactured into small “leather” goods.“Some of these materials are happy accidents,” says Solanki. “But mostly, each is the result of rigorous research and development. There is no point making a material just for the sake of it.”Solanki studied textile design at Central Saint Martins before working across fashion, architecture, lighting and automotive design for over a decade. “I always questioned my role. There was so much waste produced because material designers simply weren’t fully integrated in the process. I wanted to create a place for material designers to feel understood.”Solanki set up Ma-tt-er – a materials research design studio, consultancy and school – in 2015. “It begins with teaching,” she stresses. The workshops, talks and courses run by the studio aren’t just for designers: Solanki has helped a doctor develop a biodegradable material for tissue engineering and a chef recently turned up with a enzyme that occurs in meat. (“We inflated it, and expanded it. It was spongy:  a bit like cake.”)In the workshop, different processes are applied to create new materials. “Seaweed is a good example,” Solanki explains. “Depending on how you process it, seaweed can be a fuel, a dye, a textile, food, furniture, beauty products … We are championing this whole-systems approach to responsible materials.”Solanki is also championing the next generation of material designers. Earlier this year, in association with MaDe (a European project which promotes circular economies), Ma-tt-er launched an open-call competition for designers. Of the entrants, 120 have been chosen to attend workshops throughout the year. (In the UK, these are taking place at the London Design Festival this month.) Those who make it to the next round will develop and exhibit their materials at Milan Design Week, Barcelona Design Week and London Design Festival in 2020. Three finalists will win a paid industry placement. “It’s an opportunity I wish I’d had,” admits Solanki."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade4300152cd251fb09045f6c2c622ceef52595a/387_73_1173_704/master/1173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac33c44c11ab4d93298b00f9b8a88f02","title":"emily maitlis bbc naga munchetty race decision","story":"Newsnight presenter says corporation set ‘semantic conundrum’ in Trump racism rulingThe Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis says the BBC is in danger of looking “massively out of touch with the real world” as a result of its critical verdict on Naga Munchetty’s comments about Donald Trump.Speaking on Saturday in support of Munchetty, who presents BBC Breakfast, Maitlis said the corporation’s executive complaints unit (ECU) was wrong to censure any member of staff who publicly called out racism.In July, Munchetty suggested on air that Trump’s tweets attacking four US Congresswomen of colour and urging them to “go home” were likely to be “embedded in racism”, according to her own experience. When pressed by her co-presenter she added that the US president’s remarks made her “furious”.Last week, Munchetty was judged to have broken the public broadcaster’s editorial guidelines on impartiality.Maitlis told an audience at Cliveden literary festival in Taplow, Berkshire, that the BBC had set “a semantic and linguistic conundrum” for itself by ruling that, while Munchetty was within her rights to describe Trump’s tweets as typical examples of racism, she had been wrong to imply the person who wrote them was racist.“Now, I’ve tried to practise that in the comfort of my own home. I think it’s complicated. The point is that the BBC, the complaints body, is trying to work its way through a semantic and linguistic conundrum, that they end up looking as if they have their heads down in this Dickensian ledger of for and against, or good and bad.”A BBC spokesperson said: “The statement from the executive team is clear, the BBC is not impartial on racism. Racism is not an opinion and it is not a matter for debate. Racism is racism.”Maitlis’s criticism comes after high-profile writers and journalists wrote to the  urging the BBC to reconsider. The ECU’s findings have also now been referred to Ofcom, the national media regulator.This weekend the novelist Philip Pullman and the former children’s television presenter Floella Benjamin joined the angry response to the BBC’s decision on Munchetty.Pullman, 72, tweeted: “The BBC is being timorous in the Naga Munchetty case. She’s right and they are wrong.”Benjamin, 70, who was one of the first black women to appear regularly on British television in the 1970s and 1980s, said she was dismayed by the ECU’s decision.Tony Hall, the BBC’s director general, attempted to clarify the situation on Friday in an email to staff. He said the corporation “was not impartial on racism” and that he and his fellow executives admired Munchetty for speaking out.Maitlis said this highlighted the confusion. “My worry is that the complaints body looks as if it’s massively out of touch with the real world,” she said.“You have a woman of colour in a prominent position in a main news outlet, who is a presence, but not allowed to be a voice. That’s a difficult place for a complaints body to be. It shouldn’t be my colleagues and people of colour who are having to come out and say this, it should be anyone and all of us.”Earlier this month the ECU upheld a complaint about Maitlis “sneering and bullying” during a Newsnight discussion with the newspaper columnist Rod Liddle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ca3b4b984044d3b04e4b449c1bbb75ada5ccf5/0_178_3370_2022/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068d1e59f1a4fce929547b56b51cd48d","title":"local newspapers closing down communities withering","story":"Regional newspapers are closing down in their hundreds, but it’s not just jobs being lost – communities are starting to witherOn a national level the relative decline in print journalism has been partly compensated by the shift online and a blizzard of information from other media locally, that is not the case. Many of us are increasingly likely to hear more news of the Twitter-trending lives of Piers Morgan or Kim Kardashian than the people with whom we share our own town. The effect of that shift is arguably every bit as damaging to community as the decline in footfall on the high street. A local newspaper, at its best, reflects the place in which you live in all its minute complexity – its celebrations and its commiserations and its incarcerations it not only holds powerful local figures to account, it shapes shared feelings of hope and of anger and helps to piece together the serial story of where you are.The editor of the long-defunct Barrow Herald, in Cumbria, expressed that relationship in these terms: “Nothing interests a man more than the news of his own neighbourhood. We continue our endeavours to cram our sheet full of facts – facts possessing as much local interest as possible. Our chief object is to make this paper a faithful record of everything of public importance that may transpire in Barrow.” What happens when that object and faith is lost?A 2016 study by King’s College London, found UK towns whose local newspapers had suffered closure showed a “democracy deficit” that resulted in measurably reduced community engagement by local people and a heightened distrust of public institutions. “We can all have our own social media account, but when local papers are depleted or in some cases simply don’t exist, people lose a communal voice. They feel angry, not listened to and more likely to believe malicious rumour,” Dr Martin Moore, the author of the study, observed. The absence was felt in the national conversation too. Good stories have usually filtered up the news chain from reporters on the ground. The King’s study found that the third of parliamentary constituencies that were no longer covered by a dedicated daily local newspaper at the time of the 2015 general election received scant mention during it.The Cairncross Review into the crisis was published earlier this year. It drew a familiar portrait of the reasons for this decline. The business model of local news (and by extension local democracy) was entirely dependent on classified advertising. When estate agents, car dealers and other local retailers moved their investment in “eyeballs” on to search engines, money drained away. The collapse in finance led to cutbacks in newsrooms and papers became thinner and more distant from their audience, further reducing their appeal. In particular, Dame Frances Cairncross concluded, despite many honourable and heroic exceptions, that those elements that gave local news its storytelling bite and purpose became largely unaffordable: “The cost of investigative journalism is great and rarely seems to pay for itself…”Her recommendations to the government argued for a system of direct funding of public-interest news outlets and charitable status for some publishers. The review also recommended urgent investigation by the competition regulator into the dominance of the advertising market by Facebook and Google.Some small-scale efforts to fix local news have already been made along the lines that Cairncross suggested. The BBC – whose website is part of the competitive problem for commercial local news – created the Reach Project to fund 150 journalists to cover council meetings and local public services, and to share stories both with local news organisations and the corporation.Most of the other investment in news-resuscitation is promised, ironically, by Facebook and Google, who have each launched ambitious $100m-a-year schemes (covering Britain and the US) to find ways to rebuild the local news economies that between them they have effectively destroyed. Cynics might believe these schemes to be a pre-emptive strike against regulators compromising elements of their profit engines. Google funded the Bureau Local, a branch of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, last year with a £500,000 grant, with the aim of supporting public-interest journalism in the UK by publishing free data online. Last week it announced a multimillion dollar investment in Archant, “the News Corp of East Anglia”, which owns a range of successful local titles from the Hackney Gazette to the New European. The money was to be devoted to testing models of local online news in three “news deserts” that have lost coverage.While such experiments take place – and there is cause for optimism, too, in smaller co-operative and community models of news gathering – the critical business of investigating local stories for local people persists in many areas and thrives in a few. The best journalism always has a sense of vocation. We feature insights from some of those outstanding professionals who, despite everything, continue to operate in that spirit, who understand the importance of getting the story straight for the people it affects most directly.Late-career news journalist who exposed a mock slave auction in a local schoolOriginally from New Zealand, former medical writer Amanda Cameron retrained as a journalist in her late 30s. Now 53, she is a local news democracy reporter for the Bristol Post, following a stint at the Bath Chronicle.Cameron’s early days in news journalism included a year at a New Zealand tabloid. “That was a real baptism of fire. There was so much competition to get headlines.” Working at the Bath Chronicle in the UK was very different, she says. “You instantly got out into the community, and started to meet its people, and understand its issues fully.” She reported a successful four-year fight by the residents of a local estate, Foxhill, to save their homes from demolition – which would have resulted in the loss of more than 200 social homes for rent – and she is passionate about local journalism’s importance in the wider media landscape. “Locally, you can follow up the impact of a story in a way that nationals haven’t always got the time to commit to. Seeing what happens next is so important.”Last October, Cameron started working as a local democracy reporter for the news publisher Reach from the offices of the Bristol Post. The local democracy initiative was launched by the BBC in 2017 and allocated 144 new reporters to news organisations across England, Scotland and Wales, to boost coverage of local authorities and other public sector meetings. It’s been a breath of air, she says, to go into that detail her recent stories include objections to the building of three new tower blocks on the site of a former fire station, and the accusation by a former GP that the local NHS is breaking national rules to deny people hip operations. “The reporting of the story is now the most important thing with my job, rather than finding an audience. There’s still a pressure to feed the beast in local journalism, to think of the insatiable appetite of your audience above everything.”She’s also fired up by how vital her work feels in 2019: she’s sitting before the seats of power at a regional level every day, finding out about decisions that will have considerable impact on local communities. “My priority is holding power to account locally, and it’s such an important time to be doing this. People have got so inured to austerity in many ways. It’s not a headline any more. It should be.” Interview by Jude RogersTwice Orwell prize-nominated investigative reporter whose series on Manchester’s hidden homelessness caused a political storm“I keep being asked when I’m moving to London as my work’s getting known ‘nationally’,” Jennifer Williams says, a note of weariness in her voice. “I’d rather ask a different question: why aren’t there more reporters like me all over the country? Why are places outside London not properly represented?”One of the UK’s most respected investigative journalists, Williams has undertaken some impressively dogged and far-reaching reporting. Take last year\u0027s series Hidden Homeless. She’d had “an inkling”, she says, “that single men were being placed in derelict houses a few years ago. So I started to talk to people, and the story kept growing.” She discovered that councils were placing placing families in flea-ridden, drug-infested guest houses, and went to see the mice, mould and rotting cupboards for herself. She found that people not in “priority need” were being directed to unlivable dwellings by homeless associations and local housing providers, with their landlords collecting more than £3,000 a month in housing benefit regardless. She also revealed how the deaths of homeless people were not being properly recorded, focusing on heartbreaking stories like that of Stefan Tomkins, who was crushed to death in the bin where he was sleeping.Williams’s reporting had a significant impact: Manchester town hall announced an emergency review, mayor Andy Burnham promised to buy up slum properties, and the Office of National Statistics started recording the deaths of the homeless. It wasn’t the first time her work had led to policy changes. In 2017, her investigation into the use of the drug Spice by care-leavers, prisoners and the homeless led to agencies recording incidents involving the drug for the first time, and won her specialist writer of the year at the Regional Press awards. Both investigations led to nominations for the Orwell prize.Was she proud when the authorities paid attention? “Yes. That’s why I do what I do. I want my work to change things.”Born in Ruthin, north Wales, Williams was fascinated by politics from a young age. She remembers hearing Geoffrey Howe’s incendiary cabinet resignation speech in parliament in the car with her dad in 1990 (“he always had news on the radio”) and the sleaze scandals of the John Major years. “I found them so interesting and intriguing. I got so precocious about it, I was reading Private Eye when I was 12.”Becoming a music fan in her teens, she changed tack, wanting to be a music journalist, but after an English degree at Manchester University, returned to her earlier interests. She did an NCTJ qualification by distance learning “because I couldn’t afford to go anywhere, and couldn’t drive”. She learned a lot – “particularly that you shouldn’t learn about journalism at a distance. It’s really important when you’re a local journalist to be around people.”That is more necessary than ever in the age of the internet, she says. When she started at the Stockport Express in 2007, their newsroom had one person to put articles online. “It was a crazy time to start out, because it was clear that everything was undergoing this massive revolution, and happening very quickly, and no one really knew what to do.” Nevertheless, she believes that journalism’s role in society hasn’t fundamentally changed. “It doesn’t matter whether someone reads a story through Facebook or in print. The most important question is the same to me: are you still serving the readers properly in your work? If you are, then they’ll read it.Williams’s job involves plenty of pedestrian tasks too, such as reporting “on things that happen there and then”,going to council and combined authority meetings, and keeping on top of Freedom of Information Act requests and long-term projects. Recent work includes reports on regional inequality in the UK and the troubling inefficiencies of the police’s new computer system.She sees the future of local journalism as bright. “Holding power to account and keeping on top of that for your readers is so important – and there’s an appetite to hear more than that now.” JRNorwich-based investigations editor for regional Archant titles including Eastern Daily Press. Shortlisted for an Amnesty media award in 2011 and highly commended at last year’s British journalism awardsIn July 2017, the Norwich-based newspaper Eastern Daily Press published a short news piece about an investigation at the heart of the local constabulary. One year earlier, a Norfolk police doctor had been convicted after admitting to 13 indecent assaults against female officers. Questions were raised about an initial cover-up – the assaults dated as far back as 1993 – but, according to a Norfolk police statement, an investigation by Essex police had concluded with no charges or calls for further action.“After we published,” says Tom Bristow, 32, “victims of the doctor got in touch, very annoyed, saying: ‘Hang on a sec, this isn’t what happened.’” They said the paper needed to find the full Essex investigation report if they wanted tell the whole story. “And that,” he says, “is where we came in.”In 2016, Bristow, originally from London, was appointed to a newly formed investigations unit at Archant, which owns Eastern Daily Press and more than 50 other local newspapers around the country. “We were getting all these tips that we weren’t pursuing because we were so focused on the day-to-day,” he says. The idea was that, as editor of the three-person unit, serving local papers in Suffolk and London as well as Norfolk, Bristow would be able to step back and focus on knottier stories that required time and resources to unpick. Bristow had form in this area. On his first reporting job with the Southport Visiter, soon after graduating from Edinburgh university, he carried out an investigation into Lancashire gang masters, which got him shortlisted for the Amnesty media awards in 2011. “That really gave me confidence,” he said. “It was my first job, on a tiny weekly paper, and I was being listed alongside the BBC. I thought, wow, this is worth doing.”eading up the investigations unit at Archant feels like “a very unusual and luxury position”, says Bristow. He has, for example, pursued tip-offs about rogue landlords around Norfolk, leading to several hard-hitting pieces about people in desperate rental situations he also edited a Paul Foot award-winning series, written by Emma Youle for the Hackney Gazette, about homelessness in London.For the Norfolk police story, Bristow and his reporter Dominic Gilbert spent weeks trying to get hold of the investigation report, while Gilbert went out and spoke to the victims. “It turns out Essex police did a really thorough job, reporting all kinds of failings, and none of that was mentioned in the Norfolk press release.”Their efforts didn’t go unrecognised: the resulting stories, published by the Eastern Daily Press in November and December 2017, were highly commended at last year’s British journalism awards.Without well-resourced, regional journalism such as this, Bristow believes, “local power would not be held to account across the country. Because of the traditional strength of the local press in Britain no other institutions have developed to do this. There’s got to be something there to let people know what the council and the police are up to, and to name and shame criminals as they go through the courts.” The alternative, according to Bristow, is bleak. “Local democracy simply doesn’t work if people aren’t kept informed.” Interview by Killian FoxNamed young journalist of the year for hard-hitting multimedia stories about family abduction and online suicideThe 2019 Society of Editors’ young journalist of the year was only nine months into his job at Wales Online (the online home of Welsh daily the Western Mail and its sister title, Wales on Sunday) when he won the award – and he still hadn’t finished his postponed M.A. dissertation. ““It’s probably not the right way round to do it,” Aamir Mohammed says.One of the stories that most impressed the judges was Mohammed’s 2018 long-form feature about a Cardiff-born woman, Safia Saleh, who was abducted from the city in 1986 as a toddler by her father, who took her to his home country, Yemen. Now, with Yemen in the grip of civil war – and the UK government having no evacuation procedures for British citizens - a councillor tipped off Mohammed that Saleh’s mother’s was trying to get visas and emergency passports to help Safia and her young family come back.Mohammed didn’t think about becoming a journalist until he was 15, when a careers adviser pointed out his good grades in English. Mohammed’s father ran a clothes shop, and read the South Wales Echo every day, so his son knew local journalism on his English and media degree he became “really obsessed” with news blogging. Becoming one of only 20 students on Cardiff University’s news journalism MA (700 applied in his year), Mohammed became known as “the patch king” for getting lots of stories from his allocated area of Rhymney – a fact he reveals with a shy pride. “Getting people to trust you and know you care about them is what makes a difference,” he says.Online community groups are a huge help to his work, he says. A post he spotted in his first term of university about a spate of youth crime was his first experience of making local contacts – he messaged the woman who posted it, then met her in person. “It’s essential to build that one-to-one contact,” he says. “Once people saw my stories go live, and trusted me, I was inundated.”Another story commended by the Society of Editors was a feature about the drug Spice in Butetown in Cardiff for which he interviewed users and spent time at the medical centres giving out methadone. And another (written after a local man broadcast his suicide on the internet) was a harrowing piece about online “suicide rooms”, for which Mohammed joined one such chatroom on the dark web. “Those are important stories to be told, so you’ve got to keep telling yourself: don’t get caught up. Keep a clear mind. It’s your job.”The job is not a glamorous one, neither are the hours particularly healthy, he says. “It’s every evening, every weekend, if I’m honest. You’re never really off as a local journalist.” He spends a lot of time drinking coffee at community groups, catching up with people he knows, but says he enjoys going to work every single day. “I really like representing underrepresented communities. Even though the pressure to get big stories is tough, that’s what really drives me.” JRGlasgow-based freelance journalist who writes for investigative platform the Ferret“More than ever, the public desperately needs good journalism that holds people to account and covers stories important to local communities,” says Karin Goodwin, a freelancer who has been writing about social issues in Glasgow for nearly 20 years. “A lot of the old news models have failed the public, and we need new and better ones to take their place.”Goodwin, who grew up in Argyll, became a journalist in her mid-20s. She trained with the Big Issue and worked for the Sunday Herald and the Sunday Times before going freelance. In April, for her reporting on homelessness and drug addiction in Scotland, Goodwin won the prestigious Nicola Barry award at the Scottish press awards.Two years ago, Goodwin joined Scotland-based investigative platform the Ferret, which was set up by a group of journalists in 2015. “They were frustrated with the current news model that doesn’t invest in in-depth reporting or investigations,” she says, “so they set up a co-op which is owned by its members, who are paying subscribers. We also have a couple of funders” – including Luminate and the Seedbed Trust – “but it’s really our members that are at the heart of the Ferret.” Though not exclusively local in its reporting, the platform covers regional public-interest stories at a level of detail few local newspapers can match.Periodically, the platform polls its members on subjects they would like to read more about and then covers them in detail over an extended period. One area that Goodwin has been covering is homelessness. Late last year, in partnership with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, she contributed to a series on homeless deaths around the UK, revealing that at least 94 men and women in Scotland had died while homeless over the previous 12 months.Goodwin’s in-depth knowledge of Glasgow added an extra dimension to her reporting. “A man died in the local night shelter here, and just weeks before, I had interviewed him for a separate piece about homelessness,” she said, “so I was able to go back and listen to that recording, which was quite harrowing, knowing what happened to him subsequently.”For Goodwin, maintaining a close, two-way relationship with readers is crucial. “At the Ferret we try to make sure we’re very much engaged with our members and we report the things that are important to them, as well as things we think are in the public interest,” she says. “Maybe that’s a way of getting back to building communities around the work that we do.” KFBirmingham-based content editor at the Local Democracy Reporting ServiceNow her role has changed again: in April, Belcher joined the Local Democracy Reporting Service, launched by the BBC in 2017 as a counterbalance to clickbait, funding regional journalists to report on council meetings, crime stories and other areas that might not otherwise be covered in depth by local newspapers in the digital era. Though Belcher works out of the Birmingham Live offices, her role as content editor involves liaising with news desks across the country to promote LDRS material and tailor it for inidual news websites.“Local journalism is a changing landscape, and very different from the days of print,” says Belcher. “But with online platforms we’re able to get even more information out there, cover stories in greater depth and better serve our communities, which is what local journalism is all about.”Thanks to campaigns such as #Brumfeeds, combined with an intimate understanding of local readerships, the appetite for local journalism remains strong, Belcher believes. “People really feel that they have a voice,” she says. “When national titles have come and gone, we’ll still have that place within local communities. We have longevity because we’ve built up loyalty with them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3902ec0f2a83d08aae6dbe74144b21ec9b50c82/0_455_6117_3672/master/6117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7527e0c0ac211353164ac7fff02906e3","title":"nicholas coleridge conde nast colossus of the glossy mag interview","story":"Gatecrashing royal parties, Rupert Everett cleaning his flat… after 30 years with Condé Nast, retiring chairman Nicholas Coleridge had plenty of material for his gossipy new memoirNicholas Coleridge, for so long the great panjandrum of the UK wing of the Condé Nast empire, still remembers with perfect clarity the moment he fell in love with glossy magazines. Lying ill in bed at the age of 16, he opened a copy of Harpers \u0026amp Queen he had borrowed from his mother, and the world tilted on its axis. “That first couple of hours with a glossy changed my life,” he writes in his new memoir. “I was mesmerised.” He loved it all – the writing, the pictures, even the “gentle waft” of fragrance that emanated from the advertisers’ scent strips – and in a heartbeat he knew that it was in this world he wanted to make his career. Even as he was still in his pyjamas, he was scribbling an article. It was called How to Survive Teenage Parties – a piece that, he says now, sought to define the different kinds of people you would meet at groovy gatherings on “the wild frontier” between Sussex, where his family had a house, and Hampshire.In the long years since, little has changed. The love affair continues. Coleridge will finally leave Vogue House, Condé Nast’s London HQ, at the end of this year, when he retires as chairman of the company. But he remains fully in thrall to magazines. Yes, many of them are in serious trouble (soon after we meet, it’s announced that Marie Claire is to close its UK print edition after 31 years). Yes, their budgets are vastly smaller than in the glory days (Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, GQ and House \u0026amp Garden, has only just crept back into the black, after posting a loss of £13.6m in 2017). But, he insists, they are not dead yet – and nor have they become boring, whatever I might think (to me, they seem like catalogues now, lacking the wit and drama that I too once loved).Coleridge and I meet at his house in Chelsea: a stuccoed terrace in one of London’s smartest streets (his neighbour is Richard Rogers his corner shop is Peter Jones). The interior is pale and – to my untutored eyes – sort of Oka-ish, with top notes of Rajasthan (Coleridge loves India more than any other country, and some of his collection of Indian miniatures are arranged in a pyramid shape above the fireplace). On this sunny, early autumn afternoon, he is in a slightly skittish mood – and not only because he has a book – The Glossy Years – coming out, something that is “rather nerve-racking”. Earlier today, at the House of Commons, he saw Boris Johnson’s first performance at prime minister’s questions, and listened to Sajid Javid’s spending review (as chairman of the board of trustees at the V\u0026ampA, he was happy indeed to hear that museums are in for a small rise). “All I could see from my seat was his blond hair,” he says, somewhat wonderingly. “And then, in front of me, was Jeremy Corbyn…”And how, since he has brought it up, does he feel about politics at the moment? Coleridge went to Eton and, as he notes in his book, not only are about a quarter of his closest friends Old Etonians their networks are “as deep and pervasive as Japanese knotweed”. Quite a number of those with whom he went to school are involved, to a greater or lesser degree, in the current crisis, from Charles Moore, the former editor of the Daily , to Oliver Letwin, one of the Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the government earlier this month. Does he have to avoid certain subjects at dinner parties? Yes. “I never now mention the referendum or anything that flows from it. I never mention it at work, either, though I imagine that the majority of my colleagues are remain.” A one nation Tory, he wasn’t an “ardent” remainer, though he voted that way in the referendum. His main feeling now is that he wishes there had never been a referendum in the first place. It simply wasn’t necessary: “Things were going well enough.”And what about his privilege? One of the things I like about his book is that even as he gently sends up his background, he never tries to hide it to pretend that it was anything other than extremely posh. He’s perfectly happy to reveal, for instance, that at the age of five, one of his school friends casually informed him that his father owned an island in the West Indies (this was Mustique, and the boy in question was Charlie Tennant, the son of Princess Margaret’s pal Lord Glenconner). Nor does he mind admitting that when he and two Eton friends decided to travel across Russia to Iran in their gap year, the mother of one of them, who happened to be the Duchess of Buccleuch, organised a weekend at her stately pile at which various distinguished experts were assembled to offer them advice (these experts, he writes, must have been utterly aghast at the boys’ ignorance). Nevertheless, I wonder: is he ever embarrassed to be an Etonian? Especially at this particular moment.Seriously, though. What about his privilege? Has he learned to check it? Even Vogue is woke now. For a few seconds, he hesitates. “Journalism is not the same as being a banker or something,” he finally says. His point, I think, is that, as the son of a man whose father was chairman of Lloyd’s, he had no connections in Fleet Street or anywhere else in the media (later, he will email me to emphasise this). “My parents brought us up comfortably. But we weren’t part of a rich beau monde. Candidly, that was one of the things I loved about magazines. They were a window on another world.”And once his best anecdotes were all in place, of course, there was the agony of it being read. He sent off the manuscript to his first boss, Tina Brown, the former editor of Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and Tatler (where she employed him), in the hope of getting a nice jacket quote out of her. “You have a pavlovian response to your first boss,” he says. “They always remain that.” When Brown did praise The Glossy Years, he must have felt a bit as he used to in the old days, when he used to win her over in editorial conferences by punting stories about well-hung dukes, society wives who’d once been escort girls, and particularly unctuous courtiers.After Eton, Coleridge did a stint as a trainee reporter on the comedically named Falmouth Packet, after which he went to Cambridge University where, though ostensibly studying history of art, he enjoyed a regime of “full-on time wasting”. A dedicated fan of David Bowie, he coloured his hair bright orange, and took lessons from the singer’s mime tutor Lindsay Kemp, in the hope of either meeting his hero, or Kate Bush, in class. During the holidays, he interned at Harpers \u0026amp Queen, and went travelling with, among others, his friend Craig Brown. These adventures were sometimes grubby (he hitchhiked across eastern Turkey), and sometimes swanky (in Paris, he met the former Diana Mitford, widow of the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley the thing that sticks in his mind about the encounter was that she told him she used to keep her own hand cream in the ladies’ powder room at Claridge’s). He was awarded something called an aegrotat degree – this is basically Latin for sick note – because, having hurt his back in Yazd, in Iran, he was in hospital and unable to sit his exams.The week he left Cambridge he read in the Evening Standard that Tina Brown had been appointed the editor of the ailing Tatler, and he duly wrote to her, asking for a job. His interview took place in the kitchen of the house she shared with her boyfriend (now husband), Harry Evans, the editor of the Sunday Times, where she was busy staring at a load of photographs of the 18th birthday party of the Duke of Rutland’s daughter, Lady Theresa Manners, at Belvoir Castle.“Do you know who any of these chinless characters are?” she asked him. He did. In fact, he’d been at the party himself. “I need a headline,” she said. “Something snappy.” Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Coleridge did not hesitate. “Saturday Night Belvoir?” he offered. He was hired on the spot, and no wonder: as he points out in his book, just in case the reader is not quite au fait with the correct pronunciation of the Rutlands’ pile, such a headline is a near perfect example of early 80s magazine wit, being both a pun on a well-known movie and potentially “deliciously” excluding (Belvoir Castle is pronounced “Beaver”).Tatler was fun, and bonkers. Among his tasks was to sell review copies of books to a dealer (the cash was used to pay Julian Barnes, the magazine’s restaurant critic), and to collect, in person, the monthly column of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll. Did he ever ask her about the identity of the headless man (during her orce from the duke in 1963, a photograph emerged of his wife fellating a man whose face was not shown)? “Ha ha ha, no,” he says. But eventually, he moved on, having landed a column in London’s Evening Standard.Writing a column could be terrifying: the search for a good subject every week. Coleridge, though, was creative. Three days before his first column, he had the bright idea of disguising himself as a chauffeur and gatecrashing the party for the drivers of those attending Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle. What cunning and guile, I say. “Ya! I remember it very well. It was slightly like catacombs. I recall the brickwork, about 100 drivers standing round. You had to work the room without – ha ha – drawing too much attention to yourself.” In this period, he lived in Radnor Walk, Chelsea, where – he says, en passant, in his book – the actor Rupert Everett was his “charlady”. Could he tell me more? “Well, he was on the periphery of people I knew. I said I was looking for someone to clean the flat, and he said he would like the £2 an hour.” How lovely, having someone so attractive about the place. “Well, I was at the office! Actually, when I came back, the flat sometimes looked disappointingly much the same as it had when I left.”In 1989, however, he returned to his natural jungle habitat in the form of Harpers \u0026amp Queen, and by the time he was 29, he was its editor. From there, he was wooed to Condé Nast by Si Newhouse, its billionaire owner, to become the editorial director of its British company (later, he would become its managing director, and after that, the president of Condé Nast International). Did he have pangs, putting his own journalism aside? Did he miss his byline? “The books were a great substitute,” he says (he has written many novels, as well as nonfiction). Life was, in any case, very good. For instance, his Condé Nast “training” in New York, when he became managing director, basically turned out to be an enjoyable stay at the Pierre hotel, and a series of lunches at the Four Seasons.All the same, people were, I think, too easily dazzled and distracted then – though in the case of Blow, it’s hardly surprising. She once sat next to Coleridge at dinner wearing a burqa topped with a pair of stag’s antlers. Perhaps, though, the Blows of this world were more up his street than, say, Princess Diana, who liked to pop into Vogue House for lunch, having tipped off the paps first: though he believed HRH looked fabulous at the time, and he was thrilled to the point of breathlessness when she asked him if her breasts were too small, he thinks now that “her blue suit with gold buttons had something of an Aeroflot air stewardess about it”. On the sly, he is quite the bohemian.Can magazines really survive in the digital age? He is determined that, at the top end of the market, they will. There is, he says, no better way for a company like Chanel to communicate with its select group of customers than via the pages of Vogue – and for these customers, in turn, Vogue is just “part of the kit, like Horse \u0026amp Hound in a groom’s yard”. And is Condé Nast finally becoming more egalitarian now? In the old days, those seeking a job there used to be required to give details, on paper, of any private income they had. (Condé Nast salaries being what they were, it was often said that you could only afford to work there if you were privately well off.)Though he rather shoots himself in the foot by telling me a long story about a woman who turned down a £10,000 pay rise at another company simply for the kudos of remaining at Vogue, he insists that things have changed. “At GQ and Wired we took on people from all over the place. At Vogue, half the staff at least have just come from….” He corrects himself. “Not just come from… from fashion college.”Will he grieve when he leaves Vogue House for the last time? Will he miss the cast of characters that daily enter the building via the famous revolving door in which a dachshund called Alan Plumptre, the beloved pet of a staff member, was brutally crushed to death? “No. I have worked towards retirement in stages – and also, there is a feeling that people sometimes outstay their welcome. By the time they go, everyone resents them. It has been magically lucky that the curve of growth in magazines matched my working life…” But? I wait, but no qualifier is forthcoming. In his chair by the window, the late afternoon sun falls on Coleridge’s shiny head like a blessing.The Glossy Years by Nicholas Coleridge is published by Penguin (£25).

But for Danielle Graph, becoming a first-time investor was less scary than it seemedI’m a control freak. It isn’t my most endearing quality, but it does mean that when it comes to things such as life admin and money matters, I try to heed the girl scout motto and be prepared for every eventuality. But, for some reason, I’ve never tried investing before.I’m lucky enough to have a few work-based pensions, which will apparently provide me with a grand sum of £365 per month to help me heat my home and fill my shopping trolley, once I’m of retirement age. And because I’m constantly thinking and worrying about the future, whenever I’ve found myself with any financial headroom, I’ve been diligent about saving.At the moment, though, I’m finding that, week-by-week, I’m just getting by. I work for a website part-time and my husband is in the luxury goods market, which has been hit by the recent economic uncertainty. Plus, our cost of living just seems to keep on rising – our car, our kids’ after-school clubs, even our cats seem to be getting more expensive.So I’ve decided to try to improve our financial future by dipping my toe into the big wide world of investments. This is completely new territory for me. My only experience of investment pretty much extends to watching Damian Lewis in Billions. Indeed, when people tell me that they “invest”, I can’t help picturing a 1980s yuppie in pinstripes and braces, shouting “loadsamoney” into a brick mobile phone. Can this really be for me?I start researching investments online: the words float across the screen like a different language. I wonder to myself why I’ve never tried investing before? Perhaps it has something to do with my control-freak tendencies? And yet, deciding to invest actually feels like taking control. So, undeterred by some of the jargon I encounter online, I take £1,000 out of our stagnant savings and resolve to try and make it grow. Watch out Wall Street, this twice failing maths GCSE pupil is coming for you.No matter how much I psych myself up, however, the shameful truth is I still have no idea where to really begin. So I turn to my bank, HSBC, and phone its investment helpline. I kick off my chat with the super helpful specialist by asking her to explain everything as if she’s talking to a five-year-old. I tell her I have £1,000 to invest, where do I start? (Though it’s worth noting that you can start investing in some places from only £100.)For a Joe Average like me, the specialist explains that this isn’t some get rich quick scheme, but instead to think about this for the long term – at least a five-year timeframe. Mentally, I start planning a family holiday to Disney World five years down the line. She then checks that I’ve got an emergency fund in place for dealing with any unexpected expenses. Next, we chat about how I might make the best decision for me, where I’d feel most comfortable putting my money and about the various investment options that are available. I make notes – lots of notes. It’s a lot of information to absorb, but once I have the basics, I hang up the phone and bolster what I’ve just been told with information from HSBC’s website, where everything is clearly covered. Then I phone back the helpline with further queries. This approach seems to work best for me, and gives me the best of both worlds: the personal touch over the telephone, plus the chance to supplement what I learn in my own time and at my own pace. Helpfully, everything I’ve discussed with the specialist is available online, including a timely reminder that, when it comes to investments, I may not get back what I put in – along with a brilliant jargon buster which has found itself a special place in my bookmarks toolbar.I focus on three distinct investment options. The first involves opening an account to buy shares in inidual companies – companies whose shares are publicly traded in the stock market. I keep visualising shares as if they’re slices of one giant pizza – the publicly-traded companies get sliced into so many pieces, and you then can buy a slice, or a few slices. Of course, it would have to be the world’s biggest pizza given the sheer number of shares that are typically issued. Plus, it starts making me hungry. The second option involves putting your money into a fund-based investment. A fund is basically a group of investors who collectively put their money together in one basket, and that money is spread out, across a whole range of investments.Thirdly, you can invest in a portfolio, which is basically a collection of different funds.All of these options can also can be undertaken via a stocks and shares ISA (Inidual Savings Accounts). The benefits of an ISA are that you don’t pay income or capital gains tax on what you earn, but you are limited to a maximum of £20,000 investment per year. You can split your ISA allowance between stocks and shares, and cash – a cash ISA being similar to a savings account that offers instant access to your money. A stocks and shares ISA could potentially earn you more money than the alternative, however, there is a greater risk attached, as your money is invested in stocks and shares, which can go down, as well as up.As one of my cats peers over the top of my laptop, meowing for yet more food, she reminds me of all our day-to-day expenses and why I need to try and secure a better financial future for my family. Taking in two kittens from a cat shelter seemed like the best idea at the time, but I had no idea they’d bump up our monthly costs by a rather massive £100, for cat food, litter and insurance.Now that I’m armed with decidedly more knowledge than when I started, I brew a strong cup of Earl Grey, crack open a packet of shortbread and mull over how I want to lose my investment virginity. I decide I don’t want any additional tax worries (who does?) which is why I’m going down the ISA route. I’m also looking for an investment that doesn’t require any work on my part, which is why I opt for something HSBC calls a “managed” solution, which means they take care of managing my funds and keep me updated in regular statements. I choose a stocks and shares ISA which invests in funds, rather than the alternative which invests in shares on the stock market. For the final step, I go through an online process using HSBC’s My Investment tool, which involves answering multiple, intricate questions about my finances, assessing if I can afford to invest, and delving deeply into how I feel about risk. The depth of the questions reassures me rather than puts me off – and it’s been written in a plain, easy to understand language. The tool processes my answers and conclude that I’m a person who’s comfortable with risk – so I opt for the high risk portfolio it recommends.The cost of setting up my ISA is £7.50 with an estimated* £4.50 per annum account fee. It’s been surprisingly straightforward and I bask in the positive feeling of having taken some control over my money. In fact, when I log in to my online banking app moments later, there sits my ISA account, holding my £1,000. I take a mental picture of the moment. After all, you never forget your first time.To invest or access investment advice through HSBC you must be and existing HSBC UK current or savings account customer.

Are Britons planning enough?Everyone has different financial goals with different ultimate aims – from launching a business to buying a house to investing for a better retirement. But how many of us have the right structures and plans in place to actually reach them?Many of us leave planning for our future too late, even though our longer-term goals often require longer-term arrangements. In addition, we tend to put our cash into property instead of financial products, partly because of the cultural importance attached to home ownership in the UK – with getting a foot on to the property ladder widely viewed as a key milestone. Others buy property as an investment, which can generate a rental income and may grow in value. But we’ve also seen property prices fluctuate, which can affect short-term liquidity, so this needs to be carefully considered from every perspective.We hit the streets to find out about people’s financial goals and whether or not they had put in place plans to make those goals happen.Providing for family was a big priority for many. With the rising costs of obtaining a university degree, and less secure work prospects for the next generation, some are feeling less certain about their children’s futures. “My goal is to put my daughter through university and to pay for her education. She wants to study fine art and to do a foundation course initially, so that’s the biggest thing I’m funding at the moment. I do have a financial adviser who I see now and then, who has given me advice on the best way to invest. I have a plan in place – although I’m not sure how much it will cost exactly. As a self-employed worker, finances and pensions can be complicated, but I’ve been investing into a pension since my 20s. In hindsight I probably should have invested in property!”“As a nurse who has worked in A\u0026ampE for a long time, I’m all about living for the moment and spending time with loved ones. Financially, I am stable and have put money aside for my children if they need it. I also have a few months’ wages saved up, in case something breaks in the house. But that’s it – I don’t believe in making big goals and saving up for very expensive things I don’t need.”For more information about saving for your children, go to HSBC’s saving for children guideThe majority of the people we spoke to mentioned buying property and owning a flat or house as their primary goal. For many it seems to offer the security of housing, as well as a form of investment.“I’m about to move to Sweden and I’d like to buy a property there with my partner, which might be fairly expensive. My partner and I are savers, definitely. We already have the money saved up for the purchase and I don’t have any debt. I have only ever used my credit card for things like flights and tend to use cash a lot, to avoid spending unnecessarily. I used to shop a lot but that’s changed – I don’t want to be in debt and overpaying for things I don’t need.”“My goal is to get a mortgage, so I can finally get on the property ladder – but I was recently made redundant, which wasn’t on the cards. It wasn’t great, but the plus side is that I was given a good redundancy package and I already had some savings. My uncle is an independent financial adviser, so he has given me help to get the ball rolling, but my main task is to find a new job.”For more information about securing your first home, go to HSBC’s first-time buyer’s guideOther respondents want to put money away to set up their own businesses – from marketing agencies to pizza joints. According to them, the freedom and independence that comes with running their own venture is the primary draw.“I want to run my own marketing company in Spain – where I’m from – once I graduate, so I’d say that’s my financial goal. Once I’ve done my master’s, I’ll start to save up money for the business. I’ve been asking my parents for money a lot lately, so I do need to have a proper plan in place – it’s just difficult when you’re studying and don’t have much free time. I’m really looking forward to the independence working for yourself brings, and I really like the idea of being challenged creatively.”For more information about finding the right finance for your business, go to HSBC’s guide to business borrowingSome respondents had very specific goals in mind as well as specific measures to help to fund them.“My aim this year is to finish paying for my extension and landscape gardener! I’m retired, so I spend a lot of time at home and in the garden. Last year, I downsized from a larger house to a smaller one, so I have the money to pay for it, which is lucky. I don’t have a mortgage or any huge outgoings and I’m pretty good at staying on top of my finances, but obviously these things cost money. My old house had a stream running alongside it, so I’d like a water feature in my new home, too – that’s the plan, anyway.”Another challenge for millions of people across the nation is dealing with accumulated debts. Getting on an even keel financially is the obvious springboard to building a more secure future, so getting out of the red and into the black is a common goal.“I’m determined to clear my debts. I’m already putting plans in place to do that over the next few years, including the four-month project management course I’m currently enrolled on. It can be difficult working and studying at the same time, but my goal is to land a job in the project management sector, and hopefully start to earn more. That should mean I’m able to find my way out of debt by making regular payments.”For more information about repaying your debts efficiently, go to HSBC’s guide to repaying your debts.Bear in mind, the value of investments and any income they generate can go down as well as up, meaning you may not get back what you invest.Whatever your goals and no matter your level of confidence with investing, HSBC could help you make better-informed decisions and could help you plan better.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

Jo Richings, 50, a business coach, author and speaker from Bristol, says she’s keen to invest but is flummoxed by the options available, and she admits she doesn’t have the time to spend researching the alternatives.“At the moment, half of my savings are in the bank and the other half is held in premium bonds, so there’s no interest being made,” she says. “I’m quite risk-averse when it comes to stocks and shares, and don’t know much about what to invest in. I know I need to do more but I haven’t got the patience for it.”However, the current economic climate means it’s more important than ever to take a long-term view on our financial futures, whether it’s saving for – and then living through – retirement, or simply making sure loved ones are taken care of, argues James Hewitson, Head of Wealth and Advice at HSBC. But, he notes, many people think investing is not for them because they believe they are not wealthy enough.“This comes from a common misconception that you need a lot of spare cash to start investing,” he says. “Others simply don’t know where to begin and even if they look into investing themselves they encounter technical jargon – which is a major turn off.”HSBC is taking steps to help its 38 million customers worldwide manage their day-to-day finances and save for the future.

Fuelled in part by Marie Kondo’s call to eschew anything that does not “spark joy”, a growing number of people are questioning whether they are better off with less in life – from old jackets stuck under the stairs to unnecessary shopping trips and gadgets that clog up the home, or even a property that is larger than they need.This new push towards minimalism, whereby people live with less, can have substantial benefits for the environment and people’s state of mind, as well as their finances. But does it mean living on rice and wearing the same two outfits all week? Or is there a more measured way to cutting out the unnecessary?Georgina Caro downsized the family home, gave away three-quarters of their possessions and now thinks much more carefully about every purchase. As a result, Caro and her partner, Phil Warne, who live in Cornwall with their two young children, no longer have any short-term debts and have halved their mortgage.“If you are someone who feels a constant pressure to keep up with things, bigger house, better car, more expensive clothes, then minimalism could be that breath of fresh air which allows you to step off the consumer treadmill,” she says.The proliferation of minimalist blogs online are filled with stories of how people have decluttered their homes and disposed of the bulk of their possessions. The principle is simple – buy significantly less and save in the process, paying off consumer debts and mortgages.In the US, advocates such as Joshua Fields Milburn, Ryan Nicodemus and Joshua Becker explain online how they have turned their back on the pursuit of material goods, extolling the virtues of minimalism and how it enables iniduals to live more intentionally and focus on the important things in life, people and experiences, rather than possessions. For anyone living beyond their means and concerned about debt, there is the added financial benefit.Caro, whose website gypsysoul has advice and tips on living a sustainable and simple life, started reading about minimalism five years ago, a period when she was feeling particularly stressed and overwhelmed. The family had moved into a large home in Kent and the couple were running a busy pub.“We had this fantastic big house and we were filling it with lovely things, but I could feel my anxiety levels rising. We were spending money and accumulating more and more stuff – but we didn’t need it all. It started to feel meaningless. I realised I just wanted to live a different kind of life.”They now live in a small three-bed home, having downsized twice. Each member of the family owns about 30 items of clothing. Disposable income is spent on quality family time, such as eating out and day trips, watersports and holidays, instead of material items. Owing to their change in lifestyle, the couple are able to save each month and expect to be mortgage-free within 10 years.“Shopping used to be a leisure activity but now we only shop if we need something specific. When you have spent a lot of time and effort decluttering your home, the last thing you want to do is fill it with more stuff. We have a ‘one thing in, one out policy’,” she says. “When I am shopping I ask myself: ‘Do I need it?’ And if so: ‘Why do I need it?’ If there is something we need or a holiday, for example, then we save up.”For some, the idea of minimalism brings up images of an austere life devoid of creature comforts. But Caro and others say this is not the case.Blogger Chris Wray, on his twolessthings site, says: “I have a normal lifestyle. I live in a normal house, in a normal street, with normal children. I own a car and have rent and bills to pay. To all intents and purposes I’m as normal as you. Where I differ is I arrived at the conclusion that having more ‘stuff’ doesn’t make you happy.”Rowena Driver is a professional home organiser and decluttering expert. She has run her business, An Extra Pair of Hands, in Beckenham, south-east London, for four years and says demand is growing among those who need help to organise and reduce “their stuff”.Many people feel overwhelmed by their possessions and are waking up to the notion that life would be easier and simpler with far less, she says. Frequently when she is helping a client to declutter they will find things they had forgotten about, items unopened or still with tags on, or they may have bought many duplicates of something over the years.“By reducing and organising their stuff people can find the things they need, which reduces stress,” says Driver. “And in the long run they should save time and money because they realise they don’t need to buy more. There is far less waste, which is good for the environment and their bank balance. It also makes it much quicker and easier to clean the house, so that saves people time too.”The messages of minimalism of course make financial sense. “In the worst cases people might be buying things on credit or getting into debt and it could be stuff they just don’t really need,” says Hannah Robinson, financial planner at Ellis Bates in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. “By being more careful and mindful, it should become easier to make better choices and ultimately save cash.”Robinson recommends people pay off any short-term debts first, such as credit cards and loans. After this, try to build up an emergency savings pot of cash and also consider putting in place protection policies such as life and critical illness insurance.“If you have the ambition to radically reduce the amount you spend each month on discretionary items, it might be possible to start making significant savings towards your future goals – whatever they may be.”Overwhelmed and stressed out by work and family life, Antonia Colins decided something had to change. Starting with small steps, she began by clearing out her wardrobe, then slowly moved to other parts of her home.“Little by little, I streamlined everything,” says Colins, who is from Chesham Bois in Buckinghamshire and runs a bathroom showroom with her partner. “I got rid of so much of our stuff, selling things, taking bags to the charity shop or giving things away to friends.“Overall life is a lot calmer. And best of all we are saving money because we don’t needlessly buy things.”Before she had children, Colins worked in fundraising for 10 years, and now writes the balancethroughsimplicity website. She is keen to tell people that minimalism doesn’t mean giving everything up.“People think minimalism must mean living like a monk, with no enjoyment. But it isn’t like that at all. Minimalism is about being more considered and mindful about what you buy, stopping the compulsive or impulsive spending, which so often leads to debts and stress – and more clutter,” she says.“In the past I might have had five or six different sweaters in my wardrobe, for example. Some would still have the tags on because I got them home and didn’t ever wear them. Now I have a capsule wardrobe where I can see everything and I love every item.”Colins continues: “Where there is a gap or something needs replacing I can shop to do this. It’s not about denying yourself things. It is just about being more conscious with your spending.”She says her biggest savings have been made through spending less on clothes and household goods. “I plan meals for the week so I don’t buy food unnecessarily. I’ve decluttered the kitchen cupboards so I can easily see what ingredients are there. I never buy duplicates by mistake now or throw away food. I have halved the cost of our weekly food shop through this process – it’s a huge saving.”Colins also says she has got rid of all her store and credit cards so there is no temptation to spend unwisely or on a whim, something she might have regretted in the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/938a1c5346d5c1e72b7beaa60fa76bc4d564721a/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2de72c8d803a79dae2cd724ad7ce271","title":"labour manifesto just how radical schools health","story":"It started with an attempt to topple the deputy Labour leader and was marked by noisy in-fighting over the party’s Brexit policy. Yet by the end of Labour’s annual conference in Brighton, senior allies of Jeremy Corbyn believed that they had paved the way for the most radical election manifesto seen in Britain for decades.So many announcements were planned that one key policy – the decision to radically reshape universal credit and pump some £3bn back into the benefits system in the short term – was cut out of Corbyn’s speech and revealed on Saturday instead.The policies are as numerous as they are wide-ranging. The aim of a four-day week, a state-owned drugs manufacturer, higher tax for free social care, the reversal of many legal aid cuts, a potential net-zero carbon target of 2030 and free prescriptions are among them. These are on top of controversial plans already announced, such as allowing workers to gain a stake in large companies.“Yes, lots of policies aren’t as radical as they sound – universal credit wouldn’t actually be scrapped and nor will private schools – but it would be odd not to describe this as a radical programme,” said Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Although Labour has said it will “scrap” universal credit, it will not drop all aspects of the payment. Similarly, the private schools motion will be watered down.Bell added: “Most importantly this programme is radical by volume of what is meant to be attempted in a short time. In practice serious prioritisation would be needed.”The next key moment is the party’s so-called clause V meeting, held to decide which policies end up in a manifesto. Motions passed by the grassroots to seize the assets of private schools and extend free movement will be jettisoned. Huge questions remain as to how the various programmes will be funded, but senior Corbyn allies believe it will be enough to turn an election that was meant to be all about Brexit into a wider conversation about public services. So what were the most significant policies unveiled in Brighton?The conference voted for a motion to “maintain and extend free movement rights” for EU citizens – despite the role immigration played in the referendum campaign. It also told the party to “reject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number capstargets”. It contradicted Labour’s previous manifesto commitment that “freedom of movement will end”.What’s the reality? There is no question that the Labour leadership is open to looser immigration rules, but Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been clear that the party backs a work visa scheme. That would not allow free movement to continue.Radical rating ★★★☆☆Ripping up immigration rules is radical and Labour will take a liberal approach, but whoever comes to power will have to introduce a completely new system after Brexit.The surprise announcement in Corbyn’s conference speech was a plan to create a state-owned drugs company capable of making cheap versions of medicines that are too expensive for the NHS. Such a reform would be likely to require patents to be bypassed. It is a big step and an attempt to curb what Labour regards as profiteering by Big Pharma.What’s the reality? A big measure. The pharmaceuticals industry is warning that it will undermine research by discouraging investment in new drugs, and puts smaller companies at particular risk. However, Labour says its plan is similar to policies already used in other countries.This was a new and surprise move from Labour that would take the state into a new arena.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, announced the most radical measure of the Labour conference – a pledge to move to a 32-hour week “within the next decade”, with no loss of pay.What’s the reality? The details of the policy are rather different to the headline. Businesses will not have a four-day week imposed on them. Instead, Labour will use a series of smaller measures to work towards a reduction in hours.A new commission will recommend increases in holiday entitlement to push down average working times. Meanwhile, the really radical element is the introduction of sector-by-sector collective bargaining with unions.It is far from a top-down plan to slash the working week, but there is real radicalism in this measure because of the hugely enhanced role for trade unionism that it implies. The party has not spelled out how that would work in practice.Labour committed to bringing in free personal care for the over-65s in England as a way of easing the social care crisis – at an estimated cost of £6bn. Labour also backs a cap on lifetime care costs. The move will be funded out of general taxation.What’s the reality? It is a big and expensive policy, but reaction to it has been lukewarm from experts in the sector. There are two main concerns. The first is that social care is in such a state that the priority should be stabilising the current system through the expansion of services and retention of staff. The second is that the plan does not cover all care costs such as accommodation, meaning anyone risks being exposed to huge costs if they require serious care.There is big money involved, but Labour will need to spell out the details of its cap on costs and its funding plans.The conference passed a motion calling for the assets of private schools to be redistributed “democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions”. The motion, which was driven by the party’s grassroots, was denounced by critics for creating a dangerous precedent of the state seizing private assets.What’s the reality? For all the coverage, it was immediately clear that the plans to seize the assets of the private school sector were not supported by the Labour leadership, which is currently promising to end tax reliefs and other state aid. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has signalled that the party wants to go further over time. Meanwhile, her vow to abolish Ofsted is a major change, as is the idea for a National Education Service, which the party has not yet fully sketched out.Labour will not seize private school assets, but its education policies represent a major break and private education looks set to face a serious challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ae0249001a29a4bd55da7f7344f1dcde8365a/1904_774_3141_1884/master/3141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9634deefd215887781979ed8cff18fb","title":"margaret hodge to face reselection after local labour party vote","story":"Vocal critic of Labour’s handling of antisemitism has been MP for Barking since 1994Dame Margaret Hodge, a veteran Labour MP and prominent critic of Jeremy Corbyn, has been triggered for reselection contest by her local constituency party.Hodge has served as MP for Barking in east London since 1994.In a statement to the Huffington Post, Hodge said: “I am obviously disappointed. My priority remains serving the people of Barking as I have done for the last 25 years. At a vital time for the country, with a general election looming, we should be focusing our efforts on holding Boris Johnson and the Tories to account.“I will work to secure the full backing of Barking Labour party, so I can continue to play my part as their MP in doing that.”Under reformed Labour rules, a selection contest can be triggered if a third of local Labour branches vote in favour.Hodge, who has led criticisms of the party’s handling of antisemitism among members, saw off the threat of the British National party in the 2010 general election and, in the same year, she became the first woman to be elected chair of the public accounts committee.Mike Katz, the national chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said: “Margaret Hodge has been a steadfast campaigner against racism, fascism and intolerance throughout her political life.“She saw off the BNP in Barking and has over the last few years been determined in her opposition to antisemitism within the Labour party. This is a shameful moment for a party which claims to embody the values of equality and ersity.“She has been the target of vicious smears, derision and antisemitism, because she has been resolute in her opposition to anti-Jewish racism.”Earlier this month, Diana Johnson vowed to challenge Labour party rules that have led to her facing a reselection battle before the next general election.At a meeting in Westminster she told senior party figures she would fight the “trigger ballot” process after local activists voted to try to find a new candidate for the Hull North seat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9774eaf9a6cd08d18427f52509183bc6841d4b/0_115_4950_2970/master/4950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2c9c6d2dbf6b8207ddf08911b4666e","title":"speaker john bercow summons party leaders to peace talks","story":"Meeting called after multiple MPs raise fears over effect of angry rhetoric in Commons Commons Speaker John Bercow has summoned party leaders to an emergency meeting on the growing use of inflammatory language in Westminster, amid concerns that MPs are facing an increasing safety risk before a potential election.Bercow has convened the meeting on Monday in an attempt to tackle the acrimony in the Commons and to discuss any new security measures in parliament. It comes just days after Boris Johnson accused his opponents of Brexit betrayal and surrender.A number of MPs, including former Tory minister Amber Rudd, have accused Johnson of legitimising violence against opponents with his Brexit rhetoric. He caused outrage last week after refusing to drop the term “surrender act” to describe legal measures designed to stop a no-deal Brexit.However, it is understood that the prime minister will not attend the Speaker’s meeting, instead sticking to his commitments at the Conservative party conference in Manchester. The government plans to send another minister in his place.Johnson ignited the row last week after dismissing the concerns of a Labour MP who had received death threats. Paula Sherriff referred to Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered in 2016, as she pleaded with the prime minister to refrain from using words such as “surrender”. He dismissed her concerns as “humbug”.It has emerged that West Yorkshire Police are investigating three serious threats against Sherriff in the wake of her heated exchange with Johnson last Wednesday. Sherriff, MP for Dewsbury, told the Observer that following the confrontation her office received hundreds of abusive messages in less than two days. “People are parroting his words in the emails we are getting: you voted for the surrender act, capitulation. People are so angry and the fact that we have a prime minister who is deliberately stoking up this toxic atmosphere is beyond irresponsible,” she said.Tracy Brabin, the neighbouring Labour MP for Batley and Spen, the constituency where Cox was murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016 days before the EU referendum, said her office had received a fourfold increase in abusive messages since she also told Johnson to “moderate his language” last week.Tensions will be further inflamed after it emerged that Johnson’s key adviser said the term “surrender” would be used repeatedly throughout any election campaign. Dominic Cummings told a meeting on Friday he planned to “ram it down their throats”.It came as police in Gwent investigated comments by Nigel Farage in which he said the Brexit party would “take the knife” to the civil service, condemning “overpaid pen pushers … not doing a neutral job”.Writing in the Observer, Kim Leadbeater, Cox’s sister, calls for party leaders to agree a new standard of conduct.“We cannot go on like this,” she writes. “The poison and intolerance that has infected our national political debate has to be excised. If we cannot find a way to restore some respect and responsibility to our politics the implications will be serious, not just for those in and around Westminster, but for all of us.”Jeremy Corbyn, Jo Swinson and other party leaders are expecting to attend the meeting with the Speaker. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru Westminster leader, said: “It is deeply depressing that it has come to this. Politicians on all sides of the ide have to raise the tone of debate. There is, however, a difference between passionate debate and the cynical use of focus-group tested phrases to whip up anger and ision.“Brexit has released a deeply dark side of our politics, elements of which have found its way into No 10 Downing Street. I hope this meeting will give politicians from all parties, and particularly the prime minister, the opportunity to think again.”Antoinette Sandbach, MP for Eddisbury, one of the 21 who recently had the Tory whip removed for voting against the government, wrote in the Observer the government’s cavalier approach to language was destroying British values and called on moderate Tories to speak out against this “aberration from our values”. Johnson, she added, needed “to recognise he was no longer a highly paid columnist” but the prime minister whose words were taken seriously: “Until he lives up to the reality of his actions, he lets down our country and puts his colleagues in danger.”Brabin has been advised by West Yorkshire Police to have a police presence in her constituency surgery in the wake of threats after the clash with the prime minister. She said: “I would say to anybody reading this article, say ‘well done’ to your MP because it’s going to be too late when they’re in A\u0026ampE. Do it now.”The Labour MP also revealed that even before the latest outbreak of abuse the issue was serious. A summer intern, who was also a friend of Cox, had the role of supervising Brabin’s social media account but found the abuse too much. “He was finding it impacting on his mental health so in the end I took him off the job.”Sherriff also revealed that a number of Tory MPs had approached her to offer support and some said they were making complaints to the party whip over Johnson’s conduct. One told her that he was “mortified” by Johnson’s conduct and last Thursday told Sherriff: “There are so many of us with you and we are making representations to the chief whip.”Sherriff also claimed that a cabinet minister told her that he would personally “sort this out” with Johnson and had already texted the prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced0d07463d8ef8b436e33bcc5eccf18dfa32dc6/0_29_1560_936/master/1560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bdd0e1bd122f940085ceeeb25a2ae9f","title":"tories hold 12 point lead over labour in latest poll","story":"Jeremy Corbyn’s party trails Conservatives as Lib Dems make gains among remainersThe Conservatives head into their annual conference in Manchester with a 12-point lead over Labour, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said: “Labour’s rough start to their conference doesn’t seem to have affected their position in our poll but their updated Brexit policy may have done.

Now, it can feel as if everybody is trying to quit.Amid reports of at least 805 cases of vaping-related lung injury in 46 states and one US territory, states including New York, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island have all banned sales of flavored electronic cigarette products. In California, where e-cigarette giant Juul Labs is headquartered, the matter has particularly hit home, with the state’s department of public health issuing an advisory this week urging “everyone to refrain from vaping” and the governor launching a $20m public awareness campaign about the dangers of it.“They’ve been touted as safer than cigarettes, even to the extreme of being safe, period,” said John Maa, a past president of the San Francisco Marin Medical Society. “But we don’t really know what the effects of chronic vaping is on your lungs.”And yet it was not that long ago that vaping was widely accepted as the healthier alternative to cigarettes.When e-cigarettes entered the US marketplace in about 2007, they were billed as a tool to help smokers quit smoking . Like cigarettes, they contain nicotine, but not its parent compound, tobacco, which kills up to half its users.To many, the process of vaping also felt better than smoking and with a wide variety in flavors, they appealed to an audience much wider than smokers. “Someone who doesn’t smoke might pick up a cigarette, take a few puffs, cough, and question why they’re doing it,” Maa said. “But with an electronic cigarette, it’s tasty. It’s like having a lollipop.”Around 2015, e-cigarette use began to shift from adults trying to quit smoking to nonsmoking youth. The shift coincided with the launch of Juul, the immensely popular small vape developed in San Francisco that would soon conquer the world. In hundreds of lawsuits filed in federal and local courts across the US, attorneys blame Juul for the rise in youth vaping, pointing to a targeted marketing campaign directed at kids and young adults.And in far too many cases, the kids didn’t know what they were doing.  Almost two-thirds of Juul users ages 15 to 24 surveyed by the Truth Initiative in 2018 did not know that their Juuls contained highly addictive nicotine, a substance known to be particularly harmful for youth whose brains are still developing.“These kids were trying them out because they tasted nice,” said Mahzad Hite, an attorney working on a number of personal injury lawsuits against Juul. “Nicotine can have long lasting and sometimes permanent effects on the brain of people under the age of 26. We’re seeing kids who were honor students who are now failing their classes. We’re seeing kids who were athletes who can longer perform.”Hite works at the San Francisco-based law firm Levin Simes Abrams, which has filed 60 lawsuits against Juul in the past months.“The science is developing, and I think that’s why we’re seeing so many reports now, even though vaping has been around for years,” said attorney Rachel Abrams. “We’re seeing people going in with lung issues and not knowing what’s contributing to them and not willing to admit that they’re vaping.”Abrams and Hite represent clients who have ended up in the hospital because of lung issues believed to have been caused by vaping. Some of their clients had such severe cases of pneumonia that they had to be intubated, or rushed to the emergency room. They also represent the family of a 14-year-old boy who died of an asthma attack he had while vaping.In many cases, they said, it took time before their clients realized the role vaping may have played in their health issues. Medical providers have long been asking patients questions about smoking, but only recently have they begun asking if they vape, the lawyers said.Although it may seem like all these reports of vaping-related lung injuries are suddenly coming out of the woodwork, Hite believes it is more likely that these cases have been underreported.“They’re only just now connecting the dots,” Abrams said. “We’re using the word epidemic, and it truly is. I think we’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.”In June, San Francisco – where Juul is headquartered – became the first US city to ban the sale of e-cigarettes. Juul has since spent $11.5m to promote a local ballot measure to overturn the ban, depositing workers with signs outside bus stations and flooding mailboxes with literature proclaiming that overturning the ban would stop youth vaping.Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to to the company, saying it had not received federal approval to promote and sell its vaping products as a healthier option.Juul did not return requests for comment. In testifying before Congress in July, however, the company admitted to presenting the product at a school and marketing it as “much safer than cigarettes”.The US attorney’s office of the northern district of California has opened a criminal investigation into Juul, the Wall Street Journal reported this week, though the focus of the inquiry is still unclear. On Thursday, San Joaquin County district attorney Tori Salazar announced that she was launching both a criminal and civil investigation into Juul, looking into the company’s marketing and targeting of youth.The US Federal Trade Commission is also investigating whether Juul used deceptive social marketing that targeted minors.On Wednesday, Juul’s chief executive Kevin Burns stepped down and was replaced by KC Crosthwaite, chief strategy officer at Altria, the tobacco giant that is Juul’s largest shareholder.“I have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like Juul,” Crosthwaite said in a statement. “That has been this company’s mission since it was founded, and it has taken great strides in that direction. Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry. Against that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate.”Effective immediately, the company suspended all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US.“Juul is losing a lot of steam as more reports come out and more information gets made public,” Abrams said. “I think California and San Francisco was ahead of the curve and I think the rest of the nation is going to catch up in banning them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b61be7382273928e30da54c548e95393b445b0/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf82afbd4c6630ad4265e62966753a0","title":"christian coleman mens 100m gold world athletics championships","story":"• American sprinter defends reputation after winning in 9.76sec• Justin Gatlin takes silver and Andre De Grasse bronzeThe king is dead. Long live the king. Athletics has been scavenging around for someone to claim the world’s fastest man title since Usain Bolt’s retirement in 2017. In Christian Coleman, who blitzed to a stunning 100m gold medal here in Doha in 9.76sec, making him the sixth-fastest man in history, it has undoubtedly found him.Some, like the legendary Michael Johnson, have suggested that the missed drugs tests that nearly derailed the 23-year-old American’s career last month might prevent him from becoming the face of his sport. But it is too late for that. For better or worse, that is what the softly spoken Coleman is now after claiming his first world title.And long past midnight in the Khalifa International Stadium, he offered a spirited if sometimes odd defence of his reputation, repeatedly insisting he had not been careless despite missing a drugs test and two whereabouts failures in 12 months.“I guess you are insinuating something happened but I didn’t do anything wrong,” he said. “I haven’t been careless. Everyone in this room has not been perfect. I am just a young black man living my dream, people are trying to smear my reputation.“It is what it is, but I’ll just keep doing what I’ve been doing and focus on me,” he added. “Now I’m a world champion and that’s something that nobody can ever take away from me.”Coleman was blunt on Johnson’s opinion too. “Michael Johnson doesn’t pay my bills and he doesn’t write my cheques,” he said. “I wouldn’t know who Michael Johnson was if he didn’t run fast times.”The press conference was certainly more keenly contested than the final, which was done and dusted when Coleman established clear blue water over the field.Justin Gatlin, who of course has a past of his own, ran faster than any 37-year-old in history to take silver in 9.89 while the Canadian Andre De Grasse was third in 9.90. But Britain’s Zharnel Hughes, who had been talked up as an outside medal prospect, was a disappointing sixth in 10.03.“My body wasn’t feeling up for it unfortunately,” admitted Hughes. “When I pushed out I was all over the place and I lost my form.“I was charged up for the race but as the gun banged I started feeling light headed for some reason and I tried my best to get composure and every time I tried to do something which was relaxing it just kept getting worse.”This was the first major championships without Bolt since 2005, and the lack of crowds suggested the sport was missing its biggest star – and its greatest crutch. There has been much talk ever since on the need to jazz up the sport, and the IAAF certainly tried before the 100m final.First the lights across the stadium went dark and the track lit up. Then disco music began to play and after the spotlight had focused on each athlete, the lights went back up and the sprinters were called to their blocks. The problem was that at this point the stadium was at least half empty, not that it bothered Coleman, who quickly blasted clear of the field.Elsewhere the most exciting race of the night came in the women’s 10,000m as the Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan reeled in a pack of Kenyans and Ethiopians before sprinting clear of Letesenbet Gidey on the final lap to win her first world title in 30:17.63. What made the achievement even more incredible was that the 26-year-old Hassan ran the final 1500m of the race in under four minutes.The biggest shock, meanwhile, came in the men’s long jump as the Jamaican Tajay Gayle recorded the 10th-longest leap in history – breaking his personal best by 37cm – to win gold in 8.69m, well clear of Jeff Henderson, who took silver, and Juan Miguel Echevarría, who won bronze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf8a8c72f80c6240cddc560afce2d04b9d3866/137_95_3185_1912/master/3185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8d97668d3667df307225ea473747a9","title":"japan ireland rugby world cup","story":"The last time Japan caused a major shock at a Rugby World Cup they made a movie about it. The 2015 Miracle of Brighton was supposed to have been a complete one-off, never to be repeated. Now, suddenly, there is a blockbuster sequel that could generate even more at the box office. For the tournament organisers and everyone else seeking to promote rugby in Asia, this was the stuff of oval-shaped dreams.It will also hopefully transform a few perceptions elsewhere in the world. As anyone who watched this game will know, this was not some opportunist smash-and-grab raid but a richly deserved, fully justified victory over a team who were recently ranked No 1 in the world. Japan are supposed to be unworthy of so-called tier-one status but they have just harpooned one of the biggest whales in the sport.What ripples this result will generate, across the sport and, crucially, beyond. As recently as 2011 Japan were so far down the pecking order that their best result was a draw with Canada. Now they are in with a chance to qualify for the quarter-finals ahead of Ireland and Scotland unless the latter can summon up something special in Tokyo in a fortnight. When the next set of world rankings are released this coming week they will be up to eighth, ahead of Scotland.That, in itself, makes this a historic moment. In some ways the Shizuoka sensation is even more significant than the Springbok surprise, so famously masterminded by Eddie Jones. The received wisdom was that only Jones could have conjured up such an extraordinary outcome, that Jamie Joseph’s current team had an impossible act to follow. Not so. Ireland were beaten fair and square, outplayed by opponents who seemed to have plugged into an alternative energy source.By the end, Ireland were content to kick the ball out and retreat with a losing bonus point. Pragmatic, sure, but hardly what they envisaged when they flew east. Ireland have had plenty of World Cup disappointments but nothing like this. It remains possible they will still top the pool but any semblance of green impregnability has evaporated into the humid Japanese air. There remains a nagging sense Joe Schmidt’s side peaked a year ago and here was further evidence to support the prosecution’s case.This, though, was primarily a Japanese triumph, not some generous Irish gift. Not everyone in Japan is a rugby fan by any means but this is how to attract new admirers. In fan zones and bars across this extraordinary country, the outpouring of joy was something to behold. Respect and honour are everything here and Joseph’s team are suitably full of samurai warrior spirit.Not every host nation is inspired by the extra pressure of a World Cup on home soil. The opposite was true of England in 2015 and, four years on, there was more than a hint of nerves during Japan’s slightly stuttering opening night victory over Russia. There was absolutely nothing tentative, however, about their second-half display in Shizuoka. Once ahead only they looked like seizing the day. Ireland, lauded for their purposeful forward effort against Scotland, were plodding through treacle by the end. No one, on this evidence, will want to play the Brave Blossoms in the last eight.If nothing else it will hopefully be the emotional bullet train that delivers rugby to a whole new audience. Historically, rugby has often been too insular in its outlook, making decisions primarily for the few and not the many. In certain respects that is still the case but Uruguay’s victory over Fiji, Russia’s defiance, the United States’ growing appetite for the sport and now Japan’s glorious uprising have offered a tantalising glimpse of exciting new horizons.The decision to stage the tournament in Japan has certainly been vindicated. Ticket sales were already healthy but, at this rate, interest levels will disappear off the scale.Perhaps the night’s most striking image was of youthful Japanese fans in the crowd almost beside themselves with open-mouthed excitement. The best sporting events have their unforgettable snapshots and the first World Cup on Asian soil is now guaranteed to leave an indelible impression.Not only the greatest World Cup upset of all time, but the Miracle of Brighton was also the biggest shock in rugby history. Two-time winners South Africa fell to an injury-time try by Karne Hesketh for the rank outsiders to make it Japan 34 South Africa 32. The win effectively secured Eddie Jones, then Japan’s coach, the England job he now holds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3b2e09e3b757dab66e3b5f7a55426a1372455b/0_0_4736_2843/master/4736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150b2113a209cebb3bc7b4aecec141e0","title":"georgia trounce uruguay to kickstart rugby world cup campaign","story":"Georgia bounced back from their opening World Cup defeat to Wales with a comfortable 33-7 bonus-point Pool D victory over Uruguay. Georgia’s superior strength was too much for their South American opponents to handle and they ran in five tries at Kumagaya Rugby Stadium.To make matters worse for Uruguay, replacement Facundo Gattas was sent off late on for a high tackle.It took just eight minutes for Georgia to hit the scoreboard. Wing Alexander Todua broke through the Uruguayan defence and received a penalty after coming up just short of the try-line. From the resulting scrum, Georgia spun the ball wide and Todua had an easy run in. Number eight Otari Giorgadze then picked up from the base of another dominant Georgia scrum five metres out and there was no stopping him crashing over.Uruguay hit back almost immediately from a lineout. Wing Rodrigo Silva burst through a series of Georgian tackles and laid the ball off to inside centre Andres Vilaseca for an easy run under the posts.Georgia needed just two minutes of the second-half to extend their advantage and it was no surprise that it again came from their dominance at the set-piece, Levan Chilachava this time burrowing over from a five-metre scrum.Jaba Bregvadze secured the bonus point when he touched down from a rolling maul after 51 minutes and moments later Giorgi Kveseladze pounced on a loose ball to add the fifth try after Silva lost possession close to his own try line.Uruguay were reduced to 14 men three minutes from the end when Gattas left English referee Wayne Barnes with little option but to dismiss the replacement after a no-arms tackle, the Uruguayan’s shoulder making contact with the head of Georgia flanker Shalva Sutiashvili."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c362ddecd5156af85ccab79478bd2b8091c5210e/0_150_2991_1795/master/2991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8134c6c820a5273641cdf6e3a3ea664","title":"australia v wales rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"70 min: Great claim from Tipuric, and they earn a penalty for Rodda jumping across in the lineout! Patchell looks for the crossfield bomb - and again North out-jumps Koroibete. Didn’t this bloke play in the NRL? It’s a prodigious leap the Welshman has on him - but he can’t plant it cleanly on this occasion. He gets to his feet gingerly, hopefully no injury for North, he’s been one of Wales’ best today.68 min: Penalty against Australia as Rodda attempts the chargedown - but his compatriot Kepu is pinged for offside. Wales kick to touch, it’s a good opportunity for some attacking possession. We haven’t seen much of this for the men in red in this second half.66 min: Penalty against Wales - an infringement in the scrum, and Toomua says, I’ll have a look at the three points. What a see-sawing match this is turning into! Great drama.Toomua strikes it nicely, and having trailed by 15, Australia are now just a solitary point behind. What a huge final fourteen minutes to play!65 min: There’s been a big swing of momentum in this game. Australia were by and large a little disjointed and lacked cohesion in that first forty, but they’re looking a much better prospect after the break. Wales for their part appear to have gone into their shell a little in the past 10 minutes.A knock on by Wales, and they’re starting to look under pressure.64 min: Australia dart down the right, it’s Haylett-Petty with a chip and chase after White’s fine run. It’s not a great connection and the kick gives him everything to do - but it’s a gold knock on. A much-needed breather for both squads, but with Australia ascendent, you’d imagine the Welsh forward pack enjoy it more.They set the scrum, win it, and then clear their lines with a thumping kick upfield.62 min: Ooph. Is that over? Hooper pops up under the sticks, claiming it. That was pure muscle from both sides. Such incredible defence from Wales, but the gold No 7 eventually finds a way.Toomua with the kick from in front, we’re back to a four-point game!60 min: Latu feeds, Australia set up the maul, but it goes nowhere. They spin wide and Hooper’s eyes light up. Sio looks to pick and drive - they’re a metre short of the line, Australia. This is courageous stuff - they’re inching ever so closer, the Wallabies - can they find a way over?58 min: It’s a better claim and they set up the maul once more, Australia, but again the Welsh wall remains unbreachable. Excellent defence. They look to pick and drive, the Wallabies.Wales penalised for offside, great rugby this. Incredible defensive effort - but it’s set to continue. Australia go to another lineout.57 min: Australia with a lineout in a promising area - big opportunity here. They set up the maul, but the Welsh defend brilliantly - no forward momentum there. Toomua looks crossfield for Haylett-Petty with the kick, but he’s overhit it and it sails into touch. We come back for a penalty. Do they take the three? No, they’ve elected to kick for touch.55 min: Genia makes way for Nic White, meanwhile just two replacements since the break so far from Wales, Wyn Jones and Wainwright making way for Nicky Smith and Ross Moriarty.54 min: Scrum feed for Wales, after another turnover. It’s won by the men in red before a huge tackle from Hooper bundles the runner, Gareth Davies into touch! Huge work from the Australia skipper, you sense he’s a little frustrated out there.Lovely shot of Nicky Wire in the crowd reacting to that drop goal. He’s already writing lyrics about it...Look, I’ll confess I have no idea who that is, but we cater to all audiences here at the  play-by-play.52 min: Genia looks to shift wide, they’re building phases Australia as they move around 10m out from the Welsh line. One of the first times all game any side has build ten phases.But they butcher it, Australia! O’Connor tries to pop the short pass and he’s given Koroibete little chance to hold that.51 min: In the interest of avoiding more talking points - we’ll just say if you give the penalty against Kerevi, then you give the penalty against Adams, as Romain Poite has there, as the winger is accused of going a little high in the tackle. All we can ask is consistency, so fair play to the refereeing team.50 min: Australia with a chance to build some momentum - but it’s Gareth Davies who rushes out of the line once again, and he almost takes a miraculous intercept! So close for Wales, a terrific read from the scrum half, he was unfortunate not to hold that. Brilliant anticipation. 47 min: It’s a huge early replacement from Cheika as Foley is sacrificed, and Toomua has immediate effect. Kurtley Beale enters the fray in place of Ashley-Cooper. Is it a concession that not all of the coaches’ shuffles worked?45 min: Toomua with a half break, before Haylett-Petty makes a bust. He looks inside for Toomua again. They’re about a metre short of the line - some desperate tryline defence from the Welsh. But it’s Pocock who draws two defenders before finding the fullback outside him once again. A fine flowing move - is that a lifeline for Australia?Toomua lines up the conversion. Straight over the black dot, he adds two.42 min: It’s a very good carry as Wales burst down the wing, and now they look to build through the centre. They’re about 15m out, and they set up nicely - it’s passed back to Patchell, and he slots it!We talked all about the meticulous kicking game of Biggar, but it’s his replacement getting it done for Wales. What a start to the second half - just as they started the first!41 min: It’s a very fine carry from Latu who gets some forward momentum for Australia, but it’s a cold drop from Foley who causes the turnover. Wales to set for a scrum.40 min: Still, time and tide wait for no man - and we recommence! What can Australia come up with to try and salvage this match. And is it conceivable that this very reliably Welsh side will allow them any glimmers of hope to get back into the contest?Well, it’s a game of opinions and there’s plenty of ergence from you, the good readers, on both the HooperBiggar incident and Kerevi v Patchell:Kerevi’s not meant to hold his hands - and head - in a way that put the opponent at risk of a smashed windpipe. People used to hold the ball around the ribcagesolar plexus. There’s absolutely no reason to hold it that high. As the commentators remarked, the player himself knows he’s lucky to still be on the pitch. I don’t accept the “he took his mouthguard out therefore he knew he was about to get a yellow card” line - players do that on most long breaks in play to regain their breath. But I think many would agree with the rest of that statement, David.Minor turning points aside, it’s hard to argue that Wales have been the better side across that first 40. It’s the hoary chestnut of inconsistency in decisions that makes rugby fans around the world explode, though. And I imagine there are many supporters in gold still feeling a little aggrieved about losing Hodge for three weeks for an incident that should have been dealt with in-game.Some half-time reading from the earlier Pool D clash:Some warning signs there for Fiji and Australia - they’ve bounced back very well from their opening round trouncing, Georgia.And there’s the gong. What a morale-sapping end to the half for those in gold, as Wales finish the half as they started it.It’s not a mountain to climb, but it’s just outside two converted tries the difference. With runners like Kerevi Australia are always a chance for a try, but two? It could be very difficult from here, you’d imagine.Oh my. I said it was a big ten minutes, and it’s Wales who are playing the championship minutes so much better. Genia throws a chancey one, and it’s plucked out of the air by Davies who’s far too quick, and he sprints away for the try!Extras added by Patchell once again - it’s blown out to a massive 16-point margin!It’s Patchell from long-range and it hooks left - it clatters the post, and it bounces off and just over! Just, but it’s enough - and they claim the three.36 min: Oh my. We’re coming back for another TMO, with Kerevi accused of leading with the forearm. My days. Do these blokes get paid by the minute for how long they can interrupt the flow of a match?It’s a penalty against Australia. Honestly, I don’t know what Kerevi’s meant to do there - he has his hands raised to protect the ball and Satchell comes in too high in the tackle. It’s arms to chest, that rise for a secondary, indirect contact to the head.Hooper argues the toss with Poite “that’s just terrible tackle technique” - he’s not the most loveable in world rugby, but it’s hard to argue with that assessment. Honk.35 min: Good work from Wales, they rush out of the line and pressure O’Connor and it’s ball to ground.There’s talk of “greasy conditions”, which means a first reference to Warren Gatland and baby oil (drink!)33 min: O’Connor thumps downfield. No Reece Hodge, obviously, how much will they miss his booming kicking game today.We set for an Australian lineout - it’s won and Kerevi bumps the first tackler again. What a game he’s having. Ach, a poor pass out of the halves from Foley, but Hooper scrabbles to retain. They pick and drive, but Wales are defending well.No mistake, Patchell. A fair reward for his brilliant hands under pressure moments earlier. A lot of people who have come off the bench would have looked up a little with a gold freight-train running at them, but he took the hit, retained the ball, and ultimately it ends in points for Wales, once again.30 min: A big ten minutes to close this half. Owens with a lineout feed, which Wales win but it’s a poor pass out of the halves and Patchell does very well to pick up off his bootlaces. They build the phases, the Welsh continue to probe, and it’s Hooper who’s eventually penalised for coming in over the top.No Biggar, who’s off for an HIH after that mammoth tackle on Kerevi. Patchell will line up for a shot at three.Foley slots it from 10m in from touch. It floats a little ugly, but it flies between the sticks, which is the main thing for Wallabies supporters.And having been largely second-best, Australia have drawn themselves back into this one, in part due to the strong running of Kerevi, and some great work at set piece, both scrum and lineout.26 min: Australia push wide, and it’s George North who gives away a penalty. They play on, and it’s Kerevi with another monster run - he drops the goose step and palms off a would-be tackler, before Biggar comes across with a crucial try-saving tackle! We come back for the penalty.24 min: It’s some sustained possession for Wales who continue to look dangerous in attack. Kerevi just does enough defensively, but we set for another lineout. But it’s deflected towards the men in gold! A huge lineout pinch.Some more predictions trickling in:It’s a fair point, Phil. We saw Australia play a little too exuberantly to start against Fiji, before returning to a more composed form of rugby. Will we see the same again, today?20 min: It’s a good scrum from Australia - they win the penalty and get out of danger (for now).Kerevi with another big carry, before Foley looks crossfield with the kick, and it’s the veteran, Mr 120 (ish?) caps in for the five-pointer!And now the conversion. Oh my. That’s awful from Foley - has he clipped the tee? No distance, and it dips wide. Points left on the field. This could prove crucial for the Wallabies.Hi Richard. As A Kiwi living in France, I’m ided as to who I support. As a NZer, I would naturally back Satan’s XV against Aus, but as a new Frenchman, I would marginally prefer Wales in the semis. It goes without saying (shh) that England will beat us in the group match. Cheers! A good point though - I forgot to mention in the build up that this match has potentially huge ramifications for what comes later in the tournament - and that team, England, looms very large for whoever loses this one today.18 min: Wales kick to touch and set the lineout - but its pinched! Good response, from the men in gold. Wales keep the defensive runner up, and the maul goes nowhere. It’s another turnover!17 min: It’s been a lively start from French referee Romain Poite, who is calling the play back for an alleged late tackle by Michael Hooper.Goodness gracious. If we’re going to stop rugby games to come back for incidents like this, we may as well just make the halves 60 minutes.No card, but it’s a penalty to Wales.16 min: Liam Williams returns and drives a thumping kick 60m down field. Koroibete returns like a wind-up clock-cum-fridge.Wales now on the attack, Wainwright with some big metres midfield, they push left but run out of real estate.Biggar looks for another drop goal - it sails the distance.. but it’s wide!14 min: Welly, well. First close up of Cheika in the coaches box. Watch that gently simmer over the next 64 minutes, at this rate.Australia with ball in hand about 10m into the Welsh half. Kerevi with a solid run, and he bumps off his opposite number. But it’s the skipper Hooper who drops it, again!11 min: Penalty Wales! The scrum collapses, Australia accused of angling. Welsh lineout about 20m out. They go deep and it’s North on the run once again. A few phases, but Australia’s defence picks out the one-off runners. Biggar kicks to the corner, and it’s Parkes who rises above Koroibete to pluck the crossfield bomb and place it! Lovely from Biggar.And he converts well from the touchline. Fine kick, Biggar.9 min: Wales look to spread, but it’s a forward pass. A poor turnover - they’ve started by far the brighter, the World Number 3 side. We set for another scrum, Australia’s feed, just shy of halfway.7 min: But it’s a double knock-on! Wales first, and Australia’s line remains intact. They showed some southern hemisphere running rugby there, Wales, but only desperate defence brought North down, as the try line was within sight.They set the scrum, and Australia wins before Genia clears their lines.5 min: Wales with a lineout feed, Tipuric is raised and claims, Haylett-Petty takes the kick well and returns with some good metres. Kerevi almosts breaks the line but he’s held, just, by the shorts elastics!Foley throws a speculator - and it’s intercepted - too easy for Wales. Now it’s the men in red who spread wide! They’re pulled down 10m short of the line.4 min: Penalty missed! Mine eyes! Biggar from near the touchline, but he slots it just to the left. A let off for Australia. 6-0 could have been a harsh start.2 min: Haylett-Petty almost breaks the line, but he can’t maintain control and ball goes to ground. Wales advance, and it’s a penalty against Australia - Ashley-Cooper accused of being off his feet.Hello! What a way to start - the first possession, and they pinch it, and the man with 10 on his back slots it sweet as a nut! First points, first blood Wales.1 min: And it’s Biggar’s boot that starts us, and he kicks deep and targets Hooper. And there’s an early turn over! Wales with ball in hand about 30m out, what can they come up with.And there’s the anthems - belted out with gusto. More red than yellow in the crowd, you’d argue perhaps. But irrespective of who you’re supporting, this is going to be an absolute cracker.A prediction in early from Andrew Battershill: Australia are smarter than Wales. They will outscore by 2 clear tries, with a win by 3-6 points.Ooph. A more confident man then me, I believe Andrew. I’m leaning Welsh composure for this one. And Biggar’s boot.But what a game we have in store, either way. As Alun Wyn Jones leads the men in red onto the pitch for a record 130th time - kickoff’s not far away, as the players emerge to a chorus of drums and gongs. So - the danger men today? The areas where it will be won and lost?Breakdown: Hooper and Pocock. What solutions do Wales have to stop the dynamic duo?Kicking: Leali’ifano’s profligacy from the set piece could be a part factor to his dropping out of the side, while Foley comes in as a man in, let’s be fair, pretty scratchy form. Whereas Biggar on the other hand? You run out of panegyrics for a guy who performs under pressure as regularly as Wales’ No 10.Settled side v horses for courses: There’s no doubting Wales are a solid, cohesive unit. They know each others’ game and they can rely on the man next to them. But Australia? It’s a new halves pair again - albeit the experienced duo of Foley and Genia - and shifts at fullback and wing. They should still be well-drilled, but if anything goes wrong early, it could drive a wobble or two. If you need a quick refresh of how the pools are placed at the end of this morning’s Georgia v Uruguay clash:And if you missed Paul Ree’s preview for today’s huge cross-hemisphere-battle, cast your eyes over this:So, without ado, to team news.It’s an unchanged fifteen for Wales:While for Australia it’s a dramatic mix-up from Michael Cheika - with four changes (yes, four). Genia and Foley return to the halves, a suspension-enforced reshuffle as Reece Hodge drops out for Haylett-Petty, with Michael Cheika also wielding the axe on Kurtley Beale. The defensive presence of veteran Adam Ashley-Cooper preferred instead.Fresh news from the earlier Pool D clash, where Uruguay’s Los Teros were unable to sustain their heroics against Fiji, going down 33-7 to Georgia. A strong result for a proud rugby nation that keeps their progression hopes alive. At the very least it shows they’ll be highly competitive with Fiji and Australia to come. We’ll have a match report on that one, shortly.Hi all! Salutations to you and yours from wherever around the world you’re following our coverage.

It’s the battle of the Pool D heavyweights - with top spot presumably on the line.The key word there being presumably - as if we don’t exist in a world in which Uruguay have beaten Fiji and Japan have stunningly shocked Ireland. It’s already proving to be a topsy-turvy World Cup - what surprises lie in wait today?It was Jekyll and Hyde showings from both sides in their opening matches - Wales putting together one very good half, and one poor one against Georgia allowing late cheap points, with Australia trailing an impressive Fiji into the sheds, before returning to set piece and hard metres up the middle to get home comfortably.The last time these two clashed was the infamous 9-6 win in Cardiff last November, but before then it’s a phenomenal run for Australia, who have won 13 on the spin against the Welsh.Can Wales continue to build on turning that run around?

It consists of Roglic, Polanc, Nielsen, Vakoc, Dillier, Bodnar, Kock, Houle, Howes, Quintana and Carapaz. A vicious wind is really whipping across them as they battle on into the Dales. The peloton can better shield each other from these conditions. With over 200km to go the riders in the breakaway are going to have to be heroic to stay clear. 225km: The lead over the peloton has stretched to over two minutes. I’ve just seen a rider relieving himself at the side of the road. Surely he could have held it for longer than 30km. Too much coffee? 230km: Rohan Dennis and most of his Australian teammates are leading the peloton in cool and collected fashion about a minute and 25 seconds down the road from the leading group, which has now swollen to around 11 riders after Quintana’s chasing pack caught them. They’re snaking their way through Skipton, where standing water is causing them to slow up around the sharp corners. 234km: It looks like the race is finally taking shape. Polanc, Koch and Carapaz have a 10-second lead over a chasing group of around 10 riders, including Roglic, Quintana, Nielsen, Houle and Howes. Quintana looks completely in the zone and unfazed by the filthy weather as they approach Skipton. That chasing group have a minute on the peloton now too, and will no doubt join the leading trio. 238km: The peloton looks to be splitting in two as it rumbles along at a terrific pace. Jan Polanc had been out on his own with a short lead of around 11 seconds but, mercifully, he is joined by Jonas Koch and Richard Carapaz, who has pedigree having won the Giro D’Italia this year. 242km: The riders whizz through Ilkley. It’s a grand old town. I went there on holiday for a few days in February, when the weather was actually much nicer than it is today. There’s another attempt at a breakaway at the front, with Jan Polanc, Daniel Felipe Martinez Poveda and Maciej Bodnar going hell for leather to try and keep the peloton at bay. I don’t think they will be successful, though. 246km: Philippe Gilbert has suffered a front wheel puncture and requires a wheel change. There have been a fair few riders who look to have had mechanical issues so far. Julian Alaphilippe appears to be unhappy with his bike, too. He’s involved in a conversation with a mechanic in his team car. It’s tough out there. With the pace at the front, Gilbert and Alaphilippe could do without this. 250km: The breakaway fails to get away and the riders are just about grouped together again as they race down an A-road in awful conditions. I say they’re grouped together but in fact they’re rather strung out thanks to the rapid pace at the front. 253km: Martin has been joined by Primoz Roglic and Tom Wirtgen in a group of around six riders. The peloton look like they will reel them back in shortly, though, as they whizz through Otley. Roglic reached a speed of 97km per hour as he came down a sharp descent just then. In the rain! 259km: The racing begins in earnest along undulating roads out near Otley. And Ireland’s Dan Martin has attacked immediately. He’s a vision in green as he attempts to put clear air between himself and the front of the peloton. He will have preferred the longer course, one assumes, given his strength on the short climbs that have been removed. “The news is in. Some riders are not wearing national team branded, bad weather gear,” writes David Hindle. “This is even worse than a sock length infringement. Surely, the UCI must act? But this time, before the offenders reach the finishing circuit. It will certainly change the race outcome, but for the good of cycling, 40 plus riders must be DQ’d immediately!” You’re a strict man, David. In terms of knowing who is who out there, it may be very tricky when they get out into the Yorkshire Moors. The TV helicopters have been grounded by the wet weather. There’s going to be some harum-scarum riding out there, one imagines. Hopefully nothing quite as bad as this:The riders are rolling out of Leeds in a 10km neutralised zone. It’s tipping it down and many of them a wrapped up like it’s December. The racing proper will start when they get to the city’s outskirts. Good morning! Yorkshire in September was always going to be wet and wild for the Road Race World Championships and severe weather conditions have led to today’s route being shortened from 284.5km to 261km, with a shortcut from near Aysgarth to Leyburn being taken to avoid dangerous roads. It means the riders will now make nine circuits around Harrogate instead of seven which may mean there is a bigger group at the finish than was previously anticipated. Will the shorter race suit some riders more than others? Possibly. Julian Alaphilippe, who lit up the Tour de France with his brave performances, is among them though the challenge from Belgium will be strong with Philippe Gilbert, Tim Wellens, Greg Van Avermaet and Remco Evenepoel likely to work well together in difficult conditions. And could we have a Dutch one-two in the women’s and men’s races? After Annemiek van Vleuten’s stunning solo win yesterday, could Mathieu van der Poel be inspired to do something similarly brilliant today? Ben Swift and Adam Yates are the most likely challengers from Britain. Geraint Thomas chose not to ride in the inidual time-trial so he will offer solid support and may even have a go himself. Italy could provide a winner today, too. Matteo Trentin is good in the rain. Alejandro Valverde is the defending champion, but conditions do not suit him. Having finished runner-up at the Vuelta, he may not have the legs today, despite the shortened route. You can never write off Pete Sagan, either. Expect him to do something to entertain the throngs of fans in Yorkshire today.

The group of 160 or so pupils, some as young as six, turned out with banners and slogans, repeatedly shouting: “Ban plastic, save our planet.” But their most prominent placard message showed that for the youngsters of this small Italian resort town at the foot of Mont Blanc, the threat of climate change is particularly close to home. “You broke our glacier”, it read.The activists were referring to Planpincieux, a glacier on the nearby Grandes Jorasses peak that is changing so rapidly that experts warned last week that a huge portion of ice was in danger of breaking away.“We live here and can see the damage that climate change is doing,” said Matteo Pelliciotta, a teacher who helped on the march. “Every day, the glacier changes and becomes more grey in colour. This protest is more than just a message, it is a demand for politicians to take proper action.”They can be assured that at least their mayor, Stefano Miserocchi, is taking the issue seriously. Miserocchi was quick to act last week when experts at the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountain Foundation) in the Aosta Valley said up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice were at risk of sliding off the Planpincieux. The glacier, which has been closely monitored since 2013, is always moving, but the size of a recent fracture and a significant increase in the speed at which the ice is melting raised the alarm. The area is popular with hikers, so as a safety precaution Miserocchi closed mountain refuges and part of a road upon which the ice could directly fall. Contrary to initial reports, only one home had to be evacuated. The other 10 or so in the hamlet beneath the glacier are empty holiday homes. But there is nonetheless deep unease. Can the glacier hold on? For how long?“Each year you see how much the glacier changes,” Miserocchi told the Observer. “The average temperature has risen to the point where, in winter, ice is no longer being recreated because even though it snows, the temperature doesn’t get cold enough. Where there was once ice, there is now rock.”Scientists are unable to predict when the mass of ice might collapse, but Miserocchi is not taking any chances as the glacier’s transformation has already cost lives. In August last year, a heavy storm unleashed a debris flow, killing an elderly couple when their car was swept from the road that is currently closed. Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from their homes. In January, a breakage in the wall of ice caused an avalanche, narrowly missing homes.Safe Mountain Foundation experts are monitoring 184 glaciers in the Aosta Valley region. There are 4,000 glaciers across the Mont Blanc massif, the highest mountain range in Europe, which straddles Italy, France and Switzerland. Scientists predict that if emissions continue to rise at the current rate, the Alpine glaciers would shed half of their ice by 2050.Fabrizio Troilo, a geologist at the foundation, reels off a list of historical disasters caused by collapsing glaciers. In 1965, two million cubic metres of ice and debris fell from the Allalin glacier in the Swiss canton of Valais, killing 88 workers at the Mattmark dam construction site below. Five years later, an earthquake triggered the collapse of an unstable glacier in Peru, burying the town of Yungay and killing more than 20,000 people. In 1892, 200,000 cubic metres of water and ice that had collected in a cavity on the Tête-Rousse glacier in France burst through the ice, triggering a flood that cost 175 lives.More recently, a stream burst its banks in the Swiss resort of Zermatt in July, caused by glacial meltwater .“These are rare events, but all glaciers under certain circumstances can have different behaviours that can be dangerous, not so much for climbers but for people living in the area,” said Troilo.In Aosta alone, the team has recorded a massive loss of ice across the region’s glaciers, he added.“We use all the latest technology … but it’s not easy to detect a lake that forms underneath the surface. For example, in Zermatt there was an outburst even though the glacier was being continuously monitored.”As for the Planpincieux glacier, Troilo said that “everything is under control”, and in the worst-case scenario the ice would fall in the direction of the road and not on the cluster of homes in the area of Val Ferret.Looking towards the glacier from the hamlet below, Rocco Raffaele, the manager responsible for the defence of the territory at Aosta’s regional authority, said news of the potential collapse probably wouldn’t have attracted as much attention had it not emerged during the week of the UN climate action summit in New York. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the warning that part of Mont Blanc risked collapsing “must shake us all and force us to mobilise”.“But the Alps have been feeling the effects of climate change for a long time,” said Raffaele. “As a glacier disappears, the material extracts beneath it become exposed, and when it rains, like it did in August last year, that material gets deposited down.”In the event of a collapse, it would take less than two minutes for the mass to reach the municipal road.“There is a danger, but that doesn’t mean you have to shut everything down,” said Raffaele. “It simply means being aware and understanding how to be responsible in the mountains.”But, as worried tourists frantically called hotels to inquire if they should cancel their trips to Courmayeur, those running tourism businesses were unhappy that the news had generated so much attention.“This could be really damaging for us,” said Luca Savaglia from the Alpine Guides Society, which organises mountain excursions. “This particular glacier has always moved, and there are no hiking paths there, no climbing … we haven’t had any cancellations, but a lot of people have called to ask what is going on.”Residents were also unhappy that newspapers gave the impression that their town was in danger, while Jean Pierre Fosson, secretary-general of the Safe Mountain Foundation, was left fuming after Greenpeace released an inaccurate statement.“They said the situation was very dangerous in Courmayeur and that lots of homes were evacuated, but Planpincieux is 7km away from Courmayeur,” said Fosson. “We would never say a situation is not serious, but at the same time we have to give the correct information as we don’t want people living here to leave.”But in a week during which millions of children took part in a global climate strike inspired by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, experts are pleased the news has helped draw attention to the vulnerability of glaciers. The children of Courmayeur were among the estimated one million young Italian protesters.Raffaele said that the emotion galvanised by Thunberg now needed to be turned into concrete action. However, while children blame adults for breaking their environment, he advised them to also reflect on their own behaviour.“My 10-year-old daughter keeps telling me to stop doing lots of things, such as keeping the tap running while brushing my teeth,” he said. “But she is the one who leaves the lights on and takes hot showers for 30 minutes. They have an awareness that is superior to ours, but they also need to change their habits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0925cca41305ccccb179271ea0133f7a499ce1e4/0_216_1866_1119/master/1866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8049fb2b4f6f7210ce0e51e9ab18c00","title":"1949 china communist party","story":"He Yanling, who was a journalist at the People’s Daily, recalls how his hopes for the future were wreckedHe Yanling was full of hope for a “new China” in 1949. On the eve of the ceremony marking establishment of the People’s Republic on 1 October that year, the then 27-year-old page editor at the People’s Daily worked through the night to ensure the paper would come out without a glitch. The next day he joined the celebrations with his colleagues, while his wife stayed at home with their baby.The streets were filled with the sound of people chatting and singing. With the five-star red national flags billowing, hundreds of thousands of people waited for hours before Mao Zedong appeared on the balcony of the Gate of Heavenly Peace to announce the founding of the PRC. “We were so excited. We thought: at last, the Chinese people are united,” said He, now 97. His first article after the founding day was headlined “From darkness into brightness”.“We had a decade of civil war before ... so we were looking forward to building a democratic and peaceful China under a coalition government,” he said.On Tuesday, China will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist regime with fireworks and a massive military parade to showcase legions of troops and its latest weaponry, much like the one attended by the young journalist. But for He the show of national strength will lead to reflections on his lost dreams of a democratic China.The early years of the PRC’s coalition government consisted of several political parties under the leadership of the Communists guided by the principle of Mao’s “new democracy”. During that phase the Communist party was supposed to share power before advancing on to socialism and finally communism. “The ideas of the Communist party’s new democracy and a coalition government won over us,” said He, with a tinge of sadness in his voice. “We really had great hopes for new China, but the result wasn’t quite what we expected,” said He.As a teenager, He had loathed the corrupt and dictatorial rule under the Nationalist party before 1949. With ideals of fraternity, freedom and equality in mind, he and many other young people saw the Communists as the answer to the salvation of China, as championed by Mao and the party propagandists in the 1940s.From 1943 to 1946, the Communist party mouthpiece Xinhua Daily had an editorial every year on 4 July, America’s Independence Day, praising democratic ideals. In interviews with foreign journalists, Mao praised President Franklin Roosevelt’s advocacy of four freedoms, particularly the freedom from fear and freedom of speech.“We thought when the Communist party was in power it would follow the US democratic path. We genuinely believed that Mao would implement it,” he said. “But after people gain power, it’s easy to become dictatorial.”He got involved with the Communist party because of his democratic ideals. Under the National party, when communist sympathisers were harshly oppressed, 18-year-old He and his friends formed an underground reading group to study pro-democracy publications. After he went to study journalism in 1943 at the prestigious Fudan University, then based in the southwestern city of Chongqing during the Sino-Japanese war, he and his girlfriend (who became his wife) helped set up a student newspaper which acted as a front for clandestine communist activities.After their names got on the Nationalist government’s blacklist, they escaped to the nearest communist base in July 1946, where they joined the newly founded People’s Daily – then operating secretly in the rural part of the northern province of Hebei. They even changed their names to protect their families – to this day, he still uses He Yanling, his adopted name. They became party members a year later.A few years after the regime took over, Mao began to abandon his new democracy principles. Political movements such as the “thought reform” campaign and anti-rightism of the 1950s, which attacked intellectuals as bourgeois class enemies, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 – a radical agricultural campaign that led to 40 million people starving to death – and the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 blighted the lives of millions of ordinary people.He and his wife, Song Zheng, were implicated in 1959 in the “anti-right opportunist campaign” for having reported about people starving to death and party cadres’ abuse of power during the Great Leap Forward in rural China. In the Cultural Revolution, he was castigated as a “counter-revolution revisionist” and “capitalist roader” and put under detention. “For more than two decades, there was no productivity and no improvement of people’s lives – that wasn’t socialism,” He sighed.“Mao had a big ego and wouldn’t admit to his mistakes. He suppressed voices of discontent to uphold his ruling position. He launched class struggles, and people who disagreed with him were cast as dissidents from hostile classes. Things developed into the Cultural Revolution, and even he lost control over that.”Mao died in 1976, and the tumultuous decade of chaos came to an end. In 1978 the reformist leader Hu Yaobang began to rehabilitate political victims and the party began a programme of political and economic liberalisation. Hu’s death sparked the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement, which ended in a bloody military crackdown on 4 June 1989.He said he “almost completely lost hope” over the brutality of the crushing of students and ordinary people who were calling for democracy, but was also worried about the future of political and economic reforms. “But I didn’t lose hope completely, because most people in the party were opposed to it,” he said.After He and his wife retired, they and two other retired state media journalists spent nearly two decades researching historical archives and interviewing people like themselves who risked their lives as idealistic students under the Nationalist party to advocate communism before 1949.This resulted in three volumes of books, with the last volume unable to publish in China because of the candid chronicling of the tragic fates of former underground party members who suffered in countless political movements under the Communist regime. Many intellectuals were banished to hard labour in the countryside for their “bourgeois” and “counter-revolutionary” political stance.Reflecting on his life, He said he didn’t feel cheated by the Communist party, like some people from his generation. He said he and many in the party had been shocked when Mao abandoned his New Democracy principles in 1952, but he had gone along with it and had even believed that some sacrifices of freedoms under Mao’s “socialist transformation” drive were justified.“I too had doubts … but Mao enjoyed a supreme status in new China and the cult of personality was strong. People who expressed doubts were seen as ‘lagging behind’,” He said.Seventy years on, He is philosophical about his lost dreams of democracy and freedom. While he does not like the tightening of ideological control that has happened over recent years, He feels it is the authorities’ response to China finding itself in an increasingly complex international order.In view of the rise of nationalism and unilateralism, as well as economic crises in the west, which young idealists like him looked up to for democratic inspiration in the 1940s, He believes its “initial glitz of democratic spirit has been slowing and tarnishing” while China’s power has been rising. “As to what is genuine freedom and democracy,” he said, “the absolute standard has been lost.”1949 Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People’s Republic of China. 1950-51 The campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries begins.1953-1956 Mao implements socialist transition, abandoning his promises of “new democracy”.1957 The “anti-rightist movement” purges at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals with liberal economic and political views.1958-1961 The Great Leap Forward leads to 40 million people starving to death.1966-1976 The Cultural Revolution produces massive upheaval and unleashes unprecedented brutality. Up to two million people are killed.1976 Mao dies. The cause of his death is not known.1978 Political and economic liberalisation.

The longer the sea ice is gone from the productive zone the tougher it is on the bears,” said Polar Bears International’s Steven Amstrup.The loss of sea ice this year was so pronounced early in the season that tagging crews from the US Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that the sea ice offshore in the western arctic was too thin and unstable to be able to conduct their studies – the first time the team have pulled their studies because of safety issues.That’s a far cry from the two decades to 2010 when Amstrup did two two-month field studies a year. In recent years, the spring season has also been severely hampered by open water, fog and bad weather.This year, the trends were repeated. Amstrup said: “The ice in the spring … was really tough this year. What ice was there was thin and rough this year. That’s part of progressive trend that we’ve seen over several years.”The circumstances of global heating in the Arctic region, from record heatwaves in Alaska to the loss of more than 60bn tons of ice from Greenland’s ice cap during a five-day heatwave this summer, including the biggest loss in a 24-hour period since records began.For both polar bear populations, the circumstances are grim. Those that live on shore aren’t finding much to eat, says Amstrup, and those that live permanently on the pack ice don’t appear to be feeding much either.“They’re having a long fast in the summer and there’s a limit to how long that fast can last. We’re already seeing indications in terms of poorer cub survival in the Beaufort Sea. An adult bear has a lot of body mass, and maybe can get through a long summer fast, but young bears don’t have the body mass or hunting skills to survive,” he said.But because 2019 did not set a record in terms of sea-ice loss, Amstrup stressed, we should not be fooled into thinking that, short of an extreme event, circumstances have stabilized or improved.﻿Amstrup said funding cutbacks and the fact that biologists cannot get out and study the bears means it may never be able to collect the necessary data to assess “just how bad this year was”.Instead, Amstrup says this bad ice year and record warm summer are symbols of what the future will bring. Bad years like this will be increasingly frequent and the bad years will be increasingly worse – as long as we allow CO2 levels to continue to rise.“We know that as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise it’s going to be warmer and we’re going to have less and less sea ice until polar bears disappear,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974a8f0bc102cec21a135d9a1319c9fee929339c/11_20_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e6c875694a249e19f8b84d184fe03c","title":"ebola response in the democratic republic of congo in pictures","story":"This is the 10th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

report.Suppliers can be seen as “greenwashing” by purchasing certificates from companies that generate renewable electricity, which allow them to claim they provide zero-carbon energy, even though much of the power they actually supply may comes from fossil fuels, Which? has argued.Green Star Energy, Ovo Energy, Pure Planet, Robin Hood Energy, So Energy, Tonik Energy and Yorkshire Energy all sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning suppliers can buy the certificates to match this usage for only around £1.55 per customer and claim a tariff is “100 per cent renewable”.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

doing little to support additional renewable energy supply.However, some suppliers hit back at the criticism. Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Labour government would move towards a 32-hour working week, raise the minimum wage to “at least £10 an hour”, ban zero-hours contracts and give all workers full employment rights from day one of employment, he pledged.He said he believed in “working to live, not living to work”.Eyes will now turn to the Conservative Party conference, which is scheduled to get underway on Sunday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They constantly sprinkled a gaseous mixture of\u0026nbspwater, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol onto a material made to simulate cosmic dust, which was cooled down to -263C, and then hit with lamps that could kick off chemical reactions.Out of that machine came an icy film that gathered on the simulation of the dust that was inside the chamber. When researchers warmed that up and then analysed it, they found those nucleobases that are required to create\u0026nbspDNA and RNA, which are in turn required for life.They also found other interesting materials, such as amino acids, which make up proteins.Our findings suggest that the processes we reproduced could lead to the formation of the molecular precursors of life, said\u0026nbspYasuhiro\u0026nbspOba\u0026nbspin a statement. The results could improve our understanding of the early stages of chemical evolution in space.Previous experiments might actually have created those\u0026nbspnucleobases, the researchers said, but those conducting them did not have the highly precise measuring techniques to see that they were there.building blocks of life\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

report.Suppliers can be seen as “greenwashing” by purchasing certificates from companies that generate renewable electricity, which allow them to claim they provide zero-carbon energy, even though much of the power they actually supply may comes from fossil fuels, Which? has argued.Green Star Energy, Ovo Energy, Pure Planet, Robin Hood Energy, So Energy, Tonik Energy and Yorkshire Energy all sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning suppliers can buy the certificates to match this usage for only around £1.55 per customer and claim a tariff is “100 per cent renewable”.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Robert De Niro plays the real-life Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran, the film chronicling his decades-long involvement with labour union teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) and crime boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci).The $160 million drama, which marks Scorsese’s fifth collaboration with De Niro and Pesci and his first with Pacino, clocks in at over three and a half hours long, and has sparked intrigue ever since it was revealed that the film’s leading trio of actors were digitally “de-aged” for the film’s extensive flashback sequences.Others, such as Matt Zoller Seitz at RogerEbert, have additionally expressed dissatisfaction with the film’s relative lack of female characters, Zoller Seitz writing: “There’s nothing innately unacceptable about stories focusing mainly on men… But at the same time, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Scorsese’s two greatest Mafia pictures, Goodfellas and Casino, carve out substantial space for wives, girlfriends, mothers and daughters.”Created with Sketch.35 great films that bombed at the box office Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.135 Children of Men (2006)While it\u0027s now revered as one of the best films of the 21st century, Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s dystopian thriller failed to make its money back at the box office at its time of release in 2006.235 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988)This Robin Williams comedy grossed just $8m against its $46m budget, losing the studio a staggering $38m.Ali opened in the US on Christmas Day, 2001, and grossed a total of $87.7m worldwide – and still lost an estimated $63.1m.435 The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Andrew Dominik\u0027s lyrical western only just made back half of its $30m budget in 2007, but found love upon its release on DVD.Despite starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, this drama was a certified bomb at the box office, making a total of $19.6m from a $75m budget.Steven Spielberg\u0027s Roald Dahl adaptation grossed just $183m against its $140m budget – a low profit by Disney\u0027s standards.Michael Mann\u0027s cyber thriller was a box office bomb, earning only $19.7m at the box office against a budget of $70m.Just like Ridley Scott\u0027s original flopped, this lengthy sequel from Denis Villeneuve grossed just $259m worldwide and is considered a flop.This Orson Welles film may be a beloved classic, but at the time release, it failed to recoup its costs at the box office.

Here are just a selection of the reviews so far...The Irishman is clever and entertaining, to the point where you may think that’s all it’s going to be. But its last half-hour is deeply moving in a way that creeps up on you, and it’s then that you see what Scorsese was working toward all along: A mini-history of late-20th century America as filtered through the eyes of a smalltime guy who needs and wants to believe in his own importance and capacity for decency—and who can’t see, though Scorsese can, that it’s the end of a life that tells the truth about the middle.”The Irishman is Martin Scorsese’s best crime movie since Goodfellas, and a pure, unbridled illustration of what has made his filmmaking voice so distinctive for nearly 50 years… the movie zips along at such a satisfying clip that its flaws rarely amount to more than mild speed bumps along the way.”Robert De Niro says he hopes ‘low life’ Trump gets impeachedProducers deny De Niro feud ousted Mickey Rourke from The IrishmanRobert De Niro recreated classic Goodfellas scene for The IrishmanThis is an Old Man movie — a slower late-period work by a filmmaker ruminating on his advancing age, and on the beloved classics he made as a younger guy. But it’s Scorsese’s version: pulsing with more life than most younger filmmakers, before giving way to stark, chilling regret.”The Irishman, I think he mostly maintains the proper perspective. These are bad guys who’ve done bad things, but in the movie’s whispery allegory, all that misdeed is a harsh metaphor for the scrambling we do in our own lives. In The Irishman’s arresting final act, Scorsese captures the smallness and loneliness of life, its pathetic flattening out—time, in some senses but not all, eventually erodes away all of our context.”The Irishman will be released in selected UK cinemas on 8 November, before arriving on Netflix from 27 November.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Labour government would move towards a 32-hour working week, raise the minimum wage to “at least £10 an hour”, ban zero-hours contracts and give all workers full employment rights from day one of employment, he pledged.He said he believed in “working to live, not living to work”.Eyes will now turn to the Conservative Party conference, which is scheduled to get underway on Sunday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The least we can do is take care of those they leave behind.These failings are immoral and they are a direct assault on military effectiveness and therefore the defence of our country.Why  Because they corrode the morale of our servicemen and women.However many ultra-sophisticated aircraft carriers, F combat fighters, tanks and missiles we supply, the morale of the fighting man will always remain the cornerstone of combat power.High morale achieves miracles in battle, low morale leads to disaster and defeat.Low morale also makes people vote with their feet, signing off for civilian jobs where they will be properly looked after.This helps explain the woeful undermanning in the forces today, where recruiting has failed miserably to keep up with outflow.Yet a government that hopes to plug the gaping hole by increasing recruitment of soldiers from the Commonwealth shoots itself in both feet. It has made it virtually impossible for many recruits to be joined here by their families due to petty bureaucracy that could be overcome at a stroke.The Sun’s Never Forget Them campaign led the Government in July to create an Office for Veterans’ Affairs, with direct access to the Cabinet, with a new minister for Defence People and Veterans heading it.At the same time the PM promised the Government would: “Do all it can to support our Armed Forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.”No one expects overnight transformation.But after two months we have not heard one single new idea on tackling all of these age-old problems from the minister, Johnny Mercer.Mr Mercer is no ordinary politician. He’s a distinguished and courageous former soldier who fought in Afghanistan during three tours of duty and a man who I and many veterans admire and respect.He went “on strike” during Theresa May’s premiership in protest at the prosecution of British troops over historical allegations from the Northern Ireland campaign.Yet only last week we witnessed the opening of a murder trial against an elderly former soldier for alleged crimes in Londonderry half a century ago.Mr Mercer could not have done anything to prevent this.But he has not explained to the public how he intends to halt the disgraceful hounding of veterans through the courts in what is the greatest betrayal of their own Armed Forces by any government in history.In response to the Defence Committee report Mr Mercer tweeted: “I will offer a private informal session to the committee and update on every single issue raised.”Such discretion would be the way of a soldier but it is not what we expect from political leaders.The British public, as well as serving soldiers and veterans, are outraged by the abuse of our troops and those who have served.What we demand is to be told about solutions that will be actioned as soon as possible.Mr Mercer has experience of the issues raised in the latest report and served on the Defence Committee.Since entering Parliament in  he has campaigned energetically to sort out the plight of both servicemen and veterans, describing it as his main mission.If he was new to the forces’ problems we could understand he might need time to gain understanding and consider possible options.But he was selected because he has a deep understanding and experience and should have been able to announce his programme on day one.I worked at the centre of government for years and know the quagmire that confronts a minister trying to fight through a bureaucracy resistant to change and adept at wielding the civil service machinery that exists to frustrate progress.But Mr Mercer must find the resolve to overcome these obstacles. He should adopt Churchill’s dictum of “action this day”.There is no time for private briefings, blusterings and paralysis.Our troops are deployed on operations around the globe today. And who knows when the next intense battle will begin, whether over Russian expansion, Iranian aggression, or Chinese provocation, or something totally unforeseen We expect our fighting men and women to lay down their livesnecessary.It is vital that the Government and Mr Mercer do everything they can totheir courage and dedication in deeds as well as words.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They scream “You should be in jail”, then faint with shock at his far more moderate language.Labour call Tories “dirty”, “callous” or even “murderers”. Their IRA-backing shadow chancellor sniggers about lynching a female Tory.The Left cheers as a rapper waves the severed head of a Boris effigy on stage. Then they clutch their pearls when the PM pushes back.The Lib Dems scream “B***ocks to Brexit”— then demand everyone ELSE tones down their language.Speaker Bercow is right. The Commons is “toxic”. But he is blind to his blatant Remain bias helping to create it.Voters can see what this is: An organised assault to topple Boris and Brexit.Many MPs are feigning offence for effect — and for their Twitter fans. A few are genuinely upset, but only because they have mistaken their bid to reverse or ­neuter Brexit for a noble cause.It is not. Not after you have voted for a binding referendum, promised repeatedly to enact it and put the result in law.Boris calls it a “betrayal” because it is.He calls the rogue Act forcing him to beg another delay from the EU on their terms a “surrender” because it is.No, Yvette Cooper, his words are not “designed to escalate ision and hatred”. They accurately describe hugely powerful emotions, justiably felt by millions of Leavers and brought on by those politicians blocking Brexit.In  these Remainers could have accepted defeat, as others did. Instead they sided with a minority who refused, who chose to denigrate Leavers as thick racists, who willed them on to die, who promoted baseless conspiracies to delegitimise the vote.And who would now pour petrol on this fire they have started by forcing on our riven nation a second referendum openly rigged for Remain.That’s why Leavers feel betrayed.That’s what lies behind their rage.What excuse do Remainers have for theirs  That they lost  That one man still stands inconveniently between them and their destruction of a historic democratic mandate  That’s shameful.We deplore all the hatred and any targeting of MPs. We feel for their families.But how about some self-awareness and contrition from Remainer MPs, especially the malicious extremists of the hard-Left, about their own starring role in causing it IT is terrying to see vaccination rates for dangerous childhood diseases dropping.Some of it is parental idleness.

It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. He will rename the Department for Work and Pensions the Department for Social Security too.The plans will cost £billion to start with - but the future reforms could total up to far more.Despite claiming that Universal Credit is beyond repair, some policies could be kept in the new system - including the taper rate system which reduces cash as claimants work more hours.Labour refused to give any detail on when the current programme would close down completely.Thousands of Brits will be immediately stopped from being moved over onto the new system automatically.However, new claimants will apply for what the party calls a “reformed” version of the benefits system until they sort out a long-term plan.Mr Corbyn will announce the plans in a rally in the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith’s constituency.Mr Duncan Smith, the architect of Universal Credit insisted that ditching the policy altogether would cause absolute chaos - and cause stress to millions of worried Brits.He stormed: “This is a shallow and cynical attempt to distract from all of Labour’s Brexit mess, the failure to support an election, and the cost of their open doors migration policy.“Universal Credit is working. They will trash it for the sake of a dog whistle.”New Work and Pensions boss Thérèse Coffey blasted Labour’s completely reckless ideas to rip up the current welfare policies.She said: “This is totally irresponsible from Jeremy Corbyn - who now admits he would happily scrap financial support for vulnerable people with no plan as to what Labour would replace it with.“It’s reckless, political point scoring from a Party that spent years trapping people on benefits and holding them back from the opportunities that would help them build a better future for them and their families.“It is because of policies like Universal Credit that we have supported over .m people into work since , incomes are rising at their fastest pace in over a decade and income inequality is close to a -year low.“But we know there is more to do to make the system work better for those who need it most, and this why we have recently increased the amount people can earn before their benefits are reduced by £, a year.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

Hatty, the Thomas cook wedding co-ordinatar, for working for free.Lindos Wedding Karen Harvey, for offering for services for free make up and photography by Antonis Giannelis.And Charlotte Samantha for the GoFundMe page.We are looking forward to our wedding reception when wehome and seeing all of our family and friends.The pair, from Hucknall, Notts, flew out last week and were due to marry at the hotel on the Greek island of Rhodes, but their plans were thrown into chaos when Thomas Cook announced it would cease trading.The couple had paid out £, with the now bust travel firm to plan their big day and fly out family and friends.The Thomas Cook package the couple had paid for was set to include the wedding ceremony, flowers, cake, decorations and entertainment.But the devastated couple were left stranded on the Greek Island and told the ceremony may not go ahead.Thomas, who works for Rolls-Royce, told Nottinghamshire Live on Monday: Thomas Cook promised us a surprise on our wedding because of my name but this was not the surprise we were expecting.I am just devastated. We have got more than  friends and family coming out, half are stuck at home in limbo. My best man is still in England. No one here knows anything.I have been planning this for two years and it has all gone to pot. We have paid for everything. It is shattering.We dont know what we can do. Thomas Cook staff have been good but they lost their jobs.The couple, who have been together for  years, decided to marry abroad because it was cheaper to marry in Rhodes than having a wedding in the UK.However, when the hotel heard the news, they stepped in to save the couples dream wedding, pulling out all the stops to ensure Thomas and Amelia had their special day after two years of planning.Giorgos Bakas, manager at the Lindos Princess hotel told Sun Online:He just looked so disappointed and we didn’t want him to leave like that.We are honoured that he has come to our hotel, our island and Greece. Many guests were already in Rhodes when the news broke, with only the best man having to book an alternative flight, with the whole wedding party will be flown home on repatriation flights after the big day.Thomas Cook went bust in the early hours of Monday morning after failing to secure a last-ditch rescue deal, with all future flights and holidays cancelled.As many as , Thomas Cook employees among , staff around the world have also lost their jobs - many who have bravely ploughed on today to help the holidaymakers affected."},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew jeffrey epstein paris home","story":"Detectives are probing reports that the Queen’s son was often at the £million property.The home was raided last Monday with officers finding a custom-made massage parlour where Epstein and pals are said to have raped victims.The US billionaire committed suicide in a New York jail last month, soon after arriving from Paris in one of his private jets.The caretaker of his Paris property has now sensationally revealed: “I saw Prince Andrew there.”The key witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told The Sun on Sunday: “Prince Andrew stayed at the address a number of times including when Epstein was not there.”Reports in France say the Duke is expected to avoid travelling to the country while the probe is ongoing amid aides’ fears he could be hauled in for questioning.A hugely-important witness in the French enquiry is Epstein “sex slave” Virginia Roberts, who claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was .Andrew, , has repeatedly denied her claims. Virginia is prepared to testy against him in court, saying that he was “an abuser, a participant” in a worldwide sex trafficking ring that included -year-old twin girls being “recruited” in Paris.The girls, whose identities are being withheld, are said to have been sent to the US for Epstein to have sex with, while numerous other girls were attacked in Paris.The new whistleblower has been the caretaker of the Avenue Foch apartment since Epstein bought it in the early s.Epstein was jailed in the US in  for over a year but it is not clear when the whistleblower’s allegations relate to.Agents from France’s Office for the Suppression of Violence against Persons used keys provided by the man to carry out their raid.An investigating source said: “The apartment was searched from top to bottom, and everybody who was associated withwill now need to be spoken to.“Those regularly in residence in the Foch property included politicians, business people and plenty of young models and masseurs, who ended up being raped.Guests also included Epstein’s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, .

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They could end up re-shaping the political landscape of this country forever.The Supreme Court’s outlawing of a political decision and the coward Corbyn’s refusal to trigger a general election have created a dangerous Commons stalemate.At the same time voters are powerless as political conventions which are the backbone of our democracy are reshaped before their eyes.Tuesday’s court judgement overruling Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament will have a chilling effect on decision-making at the heart of government.How many future kne-edge rulings made by a PM against the clock could now be quashed by the court What about the signing of treaties  Or the appointment of ministers How about choosing to take military action in retaliation for an attack on Britain You can bet Vladimir Putin is lapping up the prospect of a British Prime Minister having to go cap in hand to a  of judges to askhe can hit back.The Supreme Court has potentially paved the way to a new era of rule by a group of unelected entities.

So Parliament must take a lead and show it can have a respectful debate. To say I was disappointed with the language used by Boris Johnson this week would be an understatement.  I would plead with him to reduce the aggression and stop the finger-pointing. As the person who holds the highest position in the UK, Boris Johnson must show leadership. Sometimes this means holding your hands up and admitting that you made a mistake. Boris Johnson must apologise. While all MPs and elected representatives have a ­responsibility to lead by example, the rise of the far-right in the UK is ­responsible for attacks on minorities. Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist. Women MPs are issued rape threats, MPs of colour are told to “go back home”. These threats are not isolated. They sit within a ­society which is becoming increasingly aggressive towards minorities. This is the work of the far-right. Remember, just this month the police said that the fastest-growing UK terrorist threat is from the ­far-right.

Tracey Connelly was jailed for allowing her -month-old son Peter to be tortured to death by her paedophile boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen. The -year-old was was initially locked up in  after admitting causing or allowing the death of her child. After four years she was released on licence but thrown back in jail in  after she was caught selling indecent photos of herself online to perverts who were turned on by her notoriety.    A source close to Connelly told the Daily Star Sunday she plans to settle down with her new lover and retrain as an office worker. They said: “She has gone all guns blazing on this one. She wants out and is doing all she can to try and be the model prisoner, even staying in her cell a lot, to make sure she can’t be accused of being involved in any wrongdoing. “Her hope is that she will be out by Christmas. Out in time to start the new year afresh, she says.”                                     Itaposs believed that Connelly could receive taxpayers money by way of legal aid to help her bid for freedom. She is expected to give evidence in person to the Parole Board to convince them she is a “changed woman”. “She has planned this massive speech about what she has learned and how things will be dferent for her from now on because of things she has put in place,” the insider said. “She is throwing everything she has at it and now has completed all the paperwork.”  Barker was jailed  years after he was found to have played a “major role” in Peter’s death. Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three years, later changed to a fixed six-year term. He was freed in  but also recalled to prison.

One of the tour operators, Andy Denson, posted his vile snap as a souvenir of a hunt on his Facebook page. Thrill-seeker Pete Livesey smiles beside his bleeding “trophy” in another picture that will horry animal lovers. On the website of the popular Huntershill Safaris, Livesey says of his experience of killing an animal: “Never had so much fun with my pants on.”    Six other British tourists, including a woman, also grin after gunning down zebras for trophies on the website of ­another company called Umlilo Safaris. The zebra is classied as vulnerable on the International Union of the Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species. Yet the creatures are one of the most popular trophies for UK hunters – with hundreds of body parts hauled back here in recent years.    They are hunted on the South African plains, where it is not illegal. In the UK a ban on the import of sick souvenirs from trophy-hunters such as Denson and Livesey is now being urgently considered by government ministers. Zac Goldsmith, animal welfare ­minister, told the Sunday People this week: “I look at the photos and it turns my stomach.”    Mr Goldsmith pledged a consultation on stopping the imports of trophy hunt parts with view to stopping this vile trade. Hunter Denson is one of the country’s top taxidermists – turning murdered ­animals into ghoulish figures to be hung on walls. He is also cashing in by helping to set up trips to slaughter big game, claiming it is for conservation. The -year-old from Padiham, Lancs, is listed as the UK agent for Thaba Thala Safaris – ­popular with ­hunters from the UK.    Wealthy Brits have bragged about their ­cruel ­exploits during the trips, which start at £, for seven days. Hunters can add animals to kill from a list of  species, including £ to add a zebra and £ ­taxidermy fees. But Eduardo Goncalves of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting branded the safaris as evil. He said: “So many of Africa’s greatest wild animals are ­already suffering thanks to the vile trophy ­hunting industry. “Now ­zebras have joined the list. In April last year zebras were ­officially listed as vulnerable. The Grévy’s zebra species is listed as ­endangered. “What is it going to take to stop these killers from wiping out our wildle completely   “Unbelievably, there are ­hardly any legal ­restrictions on shooting zebras for fun.” Denson, who has been a taxidermist for  years, boasts how he has slaughtered “every species in the eastern Cape” of South Africa and how he “love hunting but love hunting ­alongside my son even more”. On his website he adds: “I was born and bred in the countryside and feel ­I ­understand country le and the wildle that lives within it. “For the past  years I’ve provided a full taxidermy ­service mounting birds, ­mammals and specialising in deer, African and exotic shoulder and pedestal mounts from my ­studio in Padiham, Lancashire.  “In the early s my family relocated to the eastern cape of South Africa where they have lived ever since. “My auntie was a manager on one of the biggest privately owned game reserves in South Africa and for the past  years I have spent most of my time studying and hunting there. “I have been glad to see my son follow in my footsteps to become a very well ­respected professional hunter and fisherman taking clients out to fulfil their African dreams.” Mr Goncalves said: “No wonder our wildle is in the terrible situation that it’s in. There needs to be an ­immediate moratorium on the sport-hunting of all threatened animals. “The Government should ban imports of ­hunting trophies and call on other countries to join it. It’s the only way to end this evil trade.” Latest estimates put the ­remaining population of zebras at , – less than one-tenth the number of African ­elephants. And the zebra’s popularity among British trophy hunters is making the picture worse, ­according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Between - UK hunters brought in  zebra trophies. In the following decade, -, the number jumped to  zebra trophies, up  per cent.    Zebra are legal to hunt in South Africa and hunt organisers charge cheaper fees for them. By ­contrast it costs tens of thousands of pounds to hunt lions and elephants. Another firm attracting Brits is Huntershill in South Africa. Pete Livesey is pictured on the Huntershill site next to a slaughtered zebra with his boast about how much fun he is having with his pants on.

The Tizard family have given up many of leaposs creature comforts - like an indoor loo and a washing machine - to live in the Tinkers Bubble commune in Somerset. Mum Kirsty said they made the move after she had what you might call a midle crisis, and she and husband Nick have never been happier. Tired of the “rat race” of running two businesses, the Tizard family upped sticks and moved from Devon to their new home, a near self-sufficient community in south Somerset that eschews fossil fuels. Among  acres of woodland near Norton-sub Hamdon, Yeovil, the  residents till the land using horses and a Victorian plough, saw timber using a s steam engine and sell homemade apple juice to local shops, reports Somerset Live.  They grow most of their own food with the occasional help of volunteers, who come to experience communal living. Le moves at a dferent pace here: anyone in need of a wash can light the wood-burning stove “and a couple of hours later you can have a hot bath”, says Pedro Brace, who joined the community  years ago after leaving his office job. The Tizard family and Tinkers Bubble feature in a BBC Inside Out West documentary airing this Monday. Tinkers Bubble has been going for  years but the Tizards only joined last December. “We both ran our own businesses for quite a few years, we had five children and a very hectic le,” mum Kirsty told the BBC. “I had what you might call a midle crisis – I had a feeling of aposis this all there is to living apos It just seemed a rat race of trying to earn enough to pay the rent.” Nick added: Over a long period of time I started feeling fairly guilty about consumption of things, of stuff that we buy constantly that we donapost necessarily need. Christmases get fairly raucous, we used to buy them lots of presents and I just started to become aware of the wastage that we get from everything that we buy.

Disabled children and former Grenfell residents living at The Westbourne Place in Maida Vale, which is owned by housing association Octavia, were barred from entering the communal gardens. Residents of the private properties in Westbourne Place, where homes have been sold for £,, were given fobs to enable access to the communal garden. But social housing residents were denied the privilege and instead locked out of these spaces. Octavia blocked access to these spaces to avoid tenants facing the financial burden of high service charges, which were originally set by developer Redrow but are now managed by Pinnacle Property Management which runs the private side of the development. Redrow’s original plans for the luxury flats showed the gardens to be accessible for all those who lived there. These plans were approved by Westminster Council, but are now the subject of an enforcement investigation by council officers. The affordable and social housing tenants pay more than £ a month in service charges per home.    Speaking to , one family with a disabled child said they had been fighting for much-needed parking access from Pinnacle Property Management for several months. In March, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and former housing minister James Brokenshire spoke on the topic of segregating communal gardens, promising to change the law to ban the shameful practice. However, it seems that social housing residents are still facing discrimination. A former Grenfell Tower resident who lost his -year-old father in the Grenfell Tower fire, said his flat overlooks the garden and he is desperate to move before his son gets older. Hamid Al Jafari told : He asks all the timehe can play football in the garden. “Luckily he is only five so I can try to distract him and say we should play somewhere . If he was a bit older he would know what was really happening. “It’s just very disappointing, to be honest, to live like this. I am already suffering with depression from what I went through at Grenfell. Another resident, Ahmed Ali, revealed his son, , was unable to play with his best friend who lives on the private side adding that it is open discrimination.

Excitement grew in the months leading up to the special day back in , and fans were fascinated by every detail. They wanted to know about the venue, the decorations, the reception, the guestlist - but of course the most interesting detail with every wedding is the brideaposs dress. Like all women preparing to walk down the aisle, Kate wanted to keep the designer creating her dress a secret and did everything she could to keep the details out of the press.    But there was a leak and the name of the woman behind the dress - Alexander McQueenaposs Sarah Burton - got out in the lead up to the big day. Speaking on Channel  documentary Secrets of the Royal Dressmakers, royal expert Katie Nicholl discussed how much this upset the future Duchess of Cambridge. She said: Behind the scenes I think that caused tears at the Palace because Kate had done everything she could to keep the wedding dress a secret.At the time, The Sunday Times  reported: A fashion source said that the dress will be a combination of Middletonaposs own design ideas and Burtonaposs deep knowledge and understanding of high fashion.   Burton, of course, denied any involvement until she was officially announced as the designer when Kate stepped out of the car in front of Westminster Abbey. And the leak didnapost seem to bother Kate on the big day. She was the most beautul bride and she couldnapost have looked happier to marry her prince. Her dress - a stunning ivory gown with a satin bodice and lace sleeves - was a huge hit with fashion critics and fans around the world.Burton attended the royal wedding and styled Kateaposs dress before she walked down the aisle, making sure everything was perfect.    Wedding dress designer Caroline Castigliano says the big reveal was still special, even though the designer had been leaked.She said: Everybody loved Kate’s dress. That excitement when she stepped out, it was just ‘wow’. Incredible. She looked sensational. Even now it gives me butterflies.    Burton used traditional Carrickmacross craftsmanship in making the dress, a technique which dates back to the s, to represent apossomething oldapos. The attention to detail was breathtaking – from the hand-cut Chantilly lace of the sleeves, to the lace applique on the bodice and the inidual lace roses, thistles, daffodils and shamrocks hand-engineered on to the ivory silk tulle. The skirt was crafted with white satin gazar arches and pleats to echo an opening flower. And the weight of the silk tulle underskirt and .m train ensured it glided along.

The betting company has accepted a flurry of bets in the last week on Kate being pregnant after she made several public appearances. Kate, , was snapped with a new hairdo while taking Princess Charlotte to her first day at school two weeks ago - which led to pregnancy rumours online. She also touched up her hair up seven weeks before she announced she was pregant with Prince George and shortly before revealing she was going to give birth to Princess Charlotte. Body language expert Judi James told Daily Star Online: “Like a lot of women Kate does tend to change her hair when she is pregnant, although not dramatically.    “The new style and colour she emerged with when she took George and Charlotte to school did look like one of her glossiest and most fashionable looks to date. “But then she did say she’d had it done for the school run, and it could have been aimed at giving her an emotional lt as Charlotte left home for school for the first time.” Judi also said that another sign Kate is pregnant is that she was pictured touching her belly during her visit to the school. “Kate did meet a lot of small children and one baby in particular recently and it wasn’t hard to describe her teeth-baring, dimple-creating smile of utter delight as she stroked the baby’s head and chatted to the children as broodiness,” she said. “She also touched her belly, which is a common gesture of protection from women in the early stages of pregnancy. “However this is a gesture that Kate uses a lot, pregnant or not, so tends to be less than reliable as a clue.

But that is exactly what I felt when I read over breakfast how bosses of the world’s oldest travel firm lost control, hit a brick wall and yet still walked off with millions. As someone who runs a business and a family household budget, I was gobsmacked with the appalling way Thomas Cook had been driven, especially with , people depending on it for a living. And I know what it’s like to look into the eyes of people who won’t get paid next month. It’s a big responsibility for execs and auditors, whose job it is to keep a beady eye on cashflow and respond to ever-changing markets.  And Thomas Cook CEO Peter Fankhauser was paid millions to stay on top of the travel trends and customer behaviour. The sad fact is that just one in seven of us now pops into a travel agent to buy a holiday. Those who do, tend to be over , with less cash. So it wasn’t even a case of Frankhauser failing to look in the rear-view mirror, the wall of debt and failure was right in front of him, and failing to see it or ignoring it was shameful beyond-belief.

The supreme court decided that it was up to the school - not parents - to decidethey would allow kids to eat packed lunches on school grounds. The case came after a group of parents in Turin argued they should be able to opt out of school meals, saying they were costly and unhealthy. But should schools here follow suit and demand kids eat school dinners, or are packed lunches a better option  A mum and a dietitian have their say. No, they shouldnapost Paediatric dietitian Judy More believes children and parents should be able to choose whether they eat school meals or packed lunches.  She explains: “There are some children with allergies that need to be catered for, so I would hope that those would be considered for a start. “But there are some children who have very strong taste and texture preferences particularly  when they are beginning school, which means there are certain foods they afraid of eating. “That puts them in a dficult position. I have seen cases where the school or nursery think they can solve this, but the staff can put the children under undue pressure and really make them quite anxious. Some children get quite scared around meal times when there is a pressure on them to eat the school meal. “There is also the cost issue. We do have nutritional guidance here, but generally nobody is monitoring that so it doesn’t mean the schools are following standards - it is up to the school what nutritional quality of meal they provide and that can be quite low.  “Children need to eat well to make the most of their education. Sothey are on packed lunches parents have to make them ied and nutritious. Some children will bring pretty poor packed lunches just because their mum knows that she has packed something that they will at least eat. Many of  the snack foods and bars that are around now can be of very poor nutritional quality - parents adding these to a packed lunch might think they are doing the right thing but they really aren’t.” Yes, they should be compulsory But mum of two Amy Binns, would welcome an Italian-style system to take pressure off frazzled parents.  University lecturer Amy, mum to Rosie, , and -year-old Tommy says: “I confess – I have struggled to get my kids to eat a range of foods. “They do eat fruit and veg every day but it’s nearly always the same round of carrots, frozen peas and apple slices. The day I found out baked beans counted as one of your five-a-day was one of the happiest of my parenting le. “I really have tried but it is dispiriting to spend an hour cooking vegetable rissoles only to have your customers fall off their chairs and weep on the floor. “I’m a busy working mum: I don’t have time to waste and I don’t want to throw away food. The result is the tiny number of meals that fit into the Venn diagram of healthy, quick, cheap and which both kids will eat. Lunchboxes end up being a sandwich, or crackers and soft cheese, raisins or apple slices again, plus a biscuit or treat. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s not teaching a love of iety either.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA single working mum has said she is struggling to feed herself since switching to Universal Credit because of sky-high nursery fees. Kimberley Hill, from Birmingham, said she fears she will be forced to give up her job because nursery costs are leaving her with no funds to feed herself, Birmingham Live reports . The -year-old mother of two switched to Universal Credit at the end of June, believing it would be better for her family. The mum from Telford took an advance payment loan of £, to cover her between the period when her benefits stopped and her Universal Credit started. Ms Hill was surprised to learn she was required to get a job, after her youngest son Austin turned three in August, as the looking for work age had reduced from having a child aged five to three.  But undeterred, the single mum started a part time job in logistics admin by September . As a working mother, she should now be entitled to  hours free childcare per week, but she missed the deadline to apply , as she had not been intending toto work before then. Ms Hill now faces monthly outgoings of £ for nursery fees and £ for after-school care for her five-year-old Wyatt, which is more than the £ she is paid each month. Currently, Ms Hill receives £, Universal Credit per month, but this will be reduced signicantly when she starts receiving her monthly salary. She says that, after a £ allowance, her payment will reduce by p for every pound she earns. In total, Ms Hillaposs monthly outgoings come to £,..    Ms Hill said: I’m so saddened they expect me toto work and are so eager for me to do so and, when I have found something, I have no support whatsoever,” said Kimberley, from Telford. “My salary doesn’t even cover my childcare costs let alone any other bills. I cannot afford to pay for my childcare upfront.Working parent recipients of Universal Credit are entitled to claim up to % of their childcare costs, but the bills must be paid upfront by the parents and then reclaimed. But Kimberley says she is unable to do this as her rent needs to be paid upfront and her salary and Universal Credit are both paid in arrears. The cash-strapped mum has been in and out of hospital for digestive problems that doctors have diagnosed as a result of her poor diet and the lack of healthy food she eats. She said: I feed the kids then I have whatever’s left over. Healthy food is expensive, cheap food isn’t so much. The doctors say I’m not getting enough fruit and veg but I cannot comprehend spending much money on a meal. All I can afford is £ pizza and £ chips.    But the mother had truly thought Universal Credit was the best option for her family. She said: I switched to Universal Credit because I was struggling to save my weekly income support benefits to pay my monthly bills,”  said Kimberley, who says her mum and dad help her out when they can but that she doesnapost like to ask them. “I felt this decision would be best for me and my boys as Universal Credit is paid monthly. The first payment takes four to five weeks to come through but your benefits stop straight away.  I had to try to find money for new unorm and shoes. I cannot get a credit card, overdraft or loans because of a debt relief order. I’ve had to call on a neighbour to borrow some money to pay my car insurance. Sometimes I wish I hadn’t come off income support because at least I had my bills paid. But it was hardI needed a new tyre on my car or my son got a hole in his school jumper. Itaposs confusing because the amount of Universal Credit I get changes every month depending on how much childcare Iaposm claiming and how much money Iaposm earning. But it feels like I get a lot less money now. Her working schedule means that the working mum is required to pay for a full dayaposs nursery fee even though she only works between pm and pm. Until her claim to  hours a week of free childcare is increased in January, Ms Hill is only able to claim  hours per week now. The mother of two said: No wonder some people choose to just pop another child out, probably an easier option because it’s so much stress, but thataposs having a child for the wrong reasons. I didn’t expect to be a single mum. I had been with my partner for years but it didn’t work out.    Work coaches at Jobcentres are able to offer eligible claimants a Flexible Support Fund, which is a non-repayable award to help with upfront childcare costs in order to start work. Ms Hill applied for this but was told she would likely be denied as the amount she needed was so high. She said: I’m not looking for money I can blow on me, I’m just trying to do better for me and my kids. I don’t even knowI can cope with the stress or worry. I’m just taking it a day at a time and praying I get accepted for the Flexible Support Fund to tide me over. If I don’t then Iaposll have to quit my job and they will chase me to search for a new one. It will be a never ending circle. The Department for Work and Pensions team has said their team is looking into Ms Hillaposs case and have agreed to offer her help from the Flexible Support Fund. A Government spokesperson said:  We’re committed to helping everyone access the support they need. Up-front care costs can be claimed out of the Flexible Support Fund and Ms Hill’s claim has been allowed. With Universal Credit, working parents can recover up to  per cent of eligible childcare costs. Ms Hill has also applied for up to  hours free childcare to begin in January, and advice for families about when to claim is available online.

Ten years ago she was struggling to make a name for herself in Hollywood but now the Duchess tours the world and enjoys the comforts of lavish palaces. Here Judi James looks through a series of specially selected clips to analyse what we have learnt about Meghanaposs confidence and observes how on her and Prince Harryaposs recent royal tour of South Africa, weaposve seen Meghan become a lot more confident in her role as a royal. It is a stark contrast to how Meghan used to act on red carpets during her time as an actress. In , Meghan Markle was slowly becoming a household name as she entered her second season of Suits. Despite appearing to enjoy her new found fame. Judi told : Meghanaposs eye expression looks flat or even dead.    She’s narrowed her eyes to add to the sexy look but there’s none of the excitement and engagement we see so frequently now”. It appears that Meghan is also felt uncomfortable in her own skin as Meghan’s hand and her hanging arm seem set to cover her body rather than reveal it.”    By  rumours were circulating that Meghan and Harry had met and were dating. This relationship apparently “couldn’t have come soon enough for the Suits actress” as she might not have been completely happy or motivated” as a Hollywood actress. Despite still acting at this point, it seem Meghan was already slipped into her royal persona.  Judi says that As she leaves the red carpet though we can see the ‘performance’ drop and a glimpse of a Meghan that is far more familiar to royal watchers…doing her signature exit: a cute, low-status ‘baby wave’ that suggests she wants to be liked”.  At the royal couples engagement, Meghanaposs confidence levels have risen” as she boasts a much wider stance with her legs. Her wide smile looks congruent now because it reaches her eyes.During the tour to South Africa it seems Meghan is now fully immersed and engaged” as she matures in her royal role.

Peter Fankhauser, , said he was aposdeeply sorryapos and aposheartbrokenapos after the company collapsed this week costing , jobs in the UK and leaving , holidaymakers stranded abroad. Mr Fankhauser, a former gymnast, has attracted widespread criticism after it was revealed he had received £. million since he stepped into his role in November . Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the companyaposs bosses should be made to pay back their bonuses but Mr Fankhauser said £m was invested in Thomas Cook shares which are now worthless.    He told the Daily Mail on Sunday: I’m grateful for the loyalty of millions of customers. And I feel deeply, deeply sorry that they suffered this crisis. I can’t say more than that. I can just tell them I tried everything for this company. It is claimed that Thoma Cook had a balance sheet black hole of more than £billion. Claiming that his ability to save Thomas Cook was hindered by historical debts built up before he joined the company, he said: I tried my absolute best to save the company.    But the truth is I didn’t pull it over the line. And I understand all the anger, all the disappointment of my colleagues. I understand all that. But I gave everything not to be in this situation. Since the collapse of Thomas Cook on Monday the government has been forced to step in and fly stranded holidaymakers and staff back to the UK. The mission, known as Operation Matterhorn, is being led by the Civil Aviation Authority and is the biggest peacetime repatriation. Mr Fankhauser, a Swiss national, said he spent last week talking to his workforce, including at one of Thomas Cook’s largest offices, in Peterborough.  Staff will not be paid their wages for September on Monday - the companyaposs pay day. He said: It would not have been right not to go there. But it was tough. I talked to colleagues in small groups. They were crying.  They were asking very, very dficult questions, “How did it come to that  Couldn’t you have made all the decisions better ” All the questions I ask myself as well, of course. Since the companyaposs demise some workers have been forced to turn to food banks after losing their jobs, itaposs been claimed.  A meeting held by union Unite saw hundreds of devastated former employees speak about their financial woes after finding out they were unlikely to be paid their wages.

The rain should clear from the southwest this morning but will persist over parts of north Wales and northern England through much of Sunday. The rain will be accompanied by strong winds with - mph gusts likely quite widely, and to  mph over coasts and hill tops in southwest England and Wales. Unsettled conditions are set to continue with more rain warnings in place for Monday and Tuesday. There are now  flood warnings in place which means immediate action is required. In addition, there are  flood alerts, where flooding is possible and preparation is advised.    An area of heavy rain is expected to move northeast large parts of England and Wales later Monday and into Tuesday. While the more persistent rain will probably ease on Monday night but bands of heavy showers are likely to follow on into Tuesday. Through the period, - mm of rain could fall quite widely with perhaps as much as  mm over high ground in Wales and northern England. With the ground having been left wet by heavy rain in the area this weekend, some flooding is likely. More heavy rain is forecast for Monday night with flooding also likely. Met Office metrologist Helen Roberts told The Express: “Some wet and windy weather to contend with this morning, also some thundery showers in places. But having said that, it is not looking too bad across much of Scotland. “But then we bump into this weather front which will be fairly persistent and slow-moving right the way throughout the day. “To the south of that some showers which could be thundery at times. Now, there’s not much change as we head throughout the day.” Scotland and Northern Ireland will experience mainly dry conditions with some scattered showers. Ms Roberts added: “Now through this evening and more especially overnight, the wind and rain will eventually pull away into the North Sea.” "},{"url":null,"title":"vaping oils aimed british children","story":"NewsVaping oils aimed at British children sold on eBay without age checksEXCLUSIVE: The brightly-coloured products bearing logos of sweet brands have been banned in the US but are still being sold on eBay - enticing children to develop nicotine addictionsShareCommentsByScarlet Howes:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video vaping-could-worse-your-health-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news vaping-oils-aimed-british-children-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

And many mimic the trusted logos of much-loved food and drink brands. The makers also know the flavours they promise are exactly what youngsters crave. But these are all vaping liquids for e-cigarettes – enticing kids to risk health issues and potentially develop a nicotine habit. In the US, similar liquids aimed at youngsters have been pulled from the market and banned following  vaping-linked deaths and reports of more than  vaping-related illnesses. Yet the Sunday People found them available to kids in the UK via eBay without age checks – despite sales of the liquids and nicotine being illegal for under-s.    Professor Jonathan Grigg, a paediatrician at Queen Mary University of London, said: “I’m concerned that these liquids could contain dangerous chemicals. “It’s unlikely we know the long term effects of vaping and the reassurance we have from our regulatory bodies may not be backed up by complete evidence. I think there’s a risk that children will find these flavours attractive, and the smell. “Teens trying out vaping will get hooked on the flavours, and become addicted to nicotine. “The widespread advertising and use of flavouring makes me worried. Cigarettes should taste like cigarettes, not like candy.” As a result of our exposé, eBay suspended the sellers’ accounts, saying they had failed to follow rules about age verication.    A Public Health England report earlier this year showed vaping among youngsters had doubled in four years, from eight per cent in  to  per cent in .One in six  to -year-olds had tried e-cigs and many said they liked the flavours. The People’s undercover reporter found a number of eBay sellers in the UK offering fluids that mimic fizzy pop and sweets.Our investigation reveals brands like Candy Crush, Coca-Cola and Krispy Kreme are being illegally exploited to push the products, designed to be mixed with nicotine and then vaped. When we checked we found the Fantango range, with flavours like lemon  lime and apple  blackcurrant, priced at £..One reviewer wrote: “Great juice. Bought it as wanted to seetastes like Fanta.”Another product, at £., had packaging resembling Krispy Kreme, with the name Krusty Kremes. There were also rips-offs of Candy Crush and Oreo. Another liquid copied sweet brand Sour Patch Kids, bragging: “Your favourite American sour candy sweets now in your vape juice.”The products were marketed as “Premium USA” but some are manufactured in Asia.Cola ml liquid, imported from Malaysia, was being sold by a UK company and copies the Coca-Cola branding.  All listings promised “age verication checks” but orders were taken without asking for proof of age – and our researcher was told items would be sent by nd class Royal Mail post. Despite sales of e-liquids and nicotine being banned for under-s, we bought vaping liquid with ml nicotine. A concerned mum had posted on an eBay forum: “My -year-old and -year-old both found it very easy to buy their vape supplies on eBay. Apparently, eBay does not care about age policies.” We phoned the seller behind one and they claimed to check ages using something called  age verication, which eBay was unfamilar with.England’s chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has warned that the issue of children vaping could be “a ticking time bomb”.  And our findings come the same week as the boss of Juul, the largest vaping firm in the US, was forced to step down. It was accused of targeting e-cigs at kids and was hit by reports of hundreds of cases of seemingly vaping-related illness. For years, Juul promoted its e-cigs as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco.But the Food and Drug Administration recently warned it against making health claims without presenting scientic ­evidence for approval. President Donald Trump said he is banning flavoured vaping liquids amid fears of an epidemic among teenagers. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US puts the vaping death toll at  so far but says the specic substance causing illness has yet to be identied. Most patients have said they vaped products containing THC, the ingredient that produces a high in marijuana, while others said they vaped only nicotine.The long-term effects of vaping are not yet known and US health officials are advising people not to use vaping products until the cause is better understood.An explosion of pulmonary illness cases is thought to be linked to tainted vaping refill cartridges from the black market.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first time I laid eyes on Kilmartin Castle was in . An article popped up on my newsfeed with an intriguing headline: ‘Buy a Scottish Castle for the same price as a London parking space!’ I clicked on it, scrolling though the pictures and showing my partner Simon. We’d just got back from a winter trip to the Highlands, and had fallen in love with the place. With the cosy fires in every pub and beautul landscape, it was a world away from Dubai, where we were living at the time. I was half-joking when I showed Simon the article, but soon we were researching the area and dreaming of the move. We were tired of le in the UAE, where I worked as a radio presenter and Simon worked in advertising. We knewwe could handle the dreary Scottish weather in January and still love the place, we could relocate there. We flew to see Kilmartin and from that moment we knew we had to live there.    It was stunning – a th century castle set in huge grounds, two hours from Glasgow, with a pub and a deli in a nearby village. It was run-down and needed a lot of work – the whole place had been shut up for years and smelt strongly of damp, and the interior was basic. It had been a ruin for  years, with trees growing up through the floors and no roof. But in the s a hiking stone mason spotted the ruins and vowed to rescue it. Every summer for  years he stayed in a caravan in the grounds and got it to shack level, making three bedrooms and one bathroom. The castle was on the market for £, and we sat in a cafe agonising about what to offer in the sealed bid. There were a few people interested and we worried whether we were bidding high enough. As we walked out of the cafe a bird pooed on Simon, taking it as a sign, we bid at £, – and won! We were over the moon.    No lenders wanted to offer us a mortgage for a -year-old building, so we had to get an offshore company to give us the money – but only on %. We had nowhere near the £, we needed, so we took out a huge loan in Dubai, and applied for multiple credit cards. It was a bit mad and the interest each month was frightening.  Needing to earn money to pay our debts, we had to go back to Dubai. But not before giving the castle a lick of paint and airing it out. We put it on Air BB for £ a night for the whole castle, and it filled up quickly. In  we got married at Kilmartin. We had a teepee in the garden with a roaring fire. It was magical to get married at our own castle, surrounded by loved ones, but we had to go back to Dubai to carry on paying our debts. It was two more years before we were in a position to quit our jobs and leave. We spent six months travelling in our van through France, Norway, Spain and Belgium, picking up furniture for the castle, huge mirrors, paintings and chests. My favourite pieces were an ostrich egg lamp from France that ended up costing us a fortune to rewire, and a painting of a bearded lady that had hung in a famous Paris club in the s.  In January this year, we began a renovation project. We were quoted £, and the builders told us work would be completed by June, so we began to take bookings. I shouldn’t have believed them… Living in our van, we began demolishing the stud walls ourselves while the builders finished work nearby. It was hard graft and Simon and I both lost weight. With no running water, we couldn’t shower and we ended up wearing the same clothes for days at a time. It was freezing in the van, and often the highlight of our day was a trip to the tip.  I remember saying six days before my birthday, ‘All I want for my birthday is a shower,’ but I didn’t get one for another  days! There were problems: the fire safety approval didn’t come through in time for us to put in the mezzanine levels, so we had to abandon the steel supports we’d installed. We had to pull up all the flagstones and break through concrete to get rid of the damp under the floor. Everything over-ran, and we had to cancel our first month’s booking, losing £,. Plus, we went £, over budget – we were back in debt with loans. But slowly, it took shape.  We added two more bedrooms and two more bathrooms, including a shower in the turret – one of my favourite things. We tried to decorate with things that make you happy to be in a room with them. Everything just came together, despite all our decisions being made after pm, in the van, hungry and freezing. Finally, it was finished in late July. We had back-to-back bookings of the whole castle for two months, so we haven’t spent a night there yet.

Speculation has been re over Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs nanny and whilst it is not knowntheir new nanny is from Bath-based Norland, it is not unlikely. Fans spotted Archieaposs mysterious nanny when Harry and Meghan arrived in South Africa for their royal tour. The couple havenapost officially announced any details about who they have hired to help raise their son.    A source told the Sun: Meghan is a very hands-on mum but the new nanny is a godsend. She is extremely professional, with a number of nannying years under her belt, and has fitted into the family really well. A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they do not comment or guide on private staff. A spokesperson for Norland College said: We never discuss or provide details regarding any current or speculative employers of our students or graduates. So what does it take to be a royal nanny  Here is everything you need to know about Norland College which has been supplying unormed staff to the Royals for years.    . The college was revolutionary Originally named the Training School for Ladies as Childrenaposs Nurses, the college quickly become known as Norland Institute because of its location on Norland Place in London. Teacher Emily Ward founded the college on st October  in a time when childcare was usually left to housemaids. Emily Ward wanted to provide a more structured system, based on the ideas of German educationalist Froebel to help women develop from a young age. . It keeps up with the latest child psychology The curriculum at Norland has developed with the times to offer the most up to date academic childcare training courses and the highest practice standards in line with the latest research. The college explains that even though they are steeped in history they are firmly focused on the future. Dr Janet Rose, principal at Norland said: Whilst many of the founding principles of Norland have remained the same since Emily Ward started the College, our students are training and working in a very dferent world and our teaching and curriculum reflects this but at the centre of everything we do, just as it was  years ago, is the health, well-being and education of the children we care for.  . There moto is based on love Despite the constant change in curriculum, the colleges core values remain the same, with the child being at the centre of all decisions. The Norland motto is aposLove never Failethapos. . The unorm The distinctive unorm is a signicant part of Norlandaposs history and was initially designed to set Norlanders apart from other house hold staff and identy them as proffessionals. Today the brown unorm is a symbol of the collegeaposs unique reputation, tradition and quality. For the first time in  years the unorm got an update in . It was designed locally by Lauren Cope and produced by British manufacturers. It currently consists of a brown dress, tights, brown shoes, a hat, and brown gloves in winter and white for summer. Cardigans must be from a specied retailer.  . The course Students study for a three year full-time bachelors degreeHons in Early Years Development and Learning alongside the very specialised Norland Diploma. You have to pass every element of the Norland diploma to use the professional title Norland Nanny or Norlander. The three-year degree covers everything from child psychology and health, to philosophies of childhood education. The nannies-to-be spend a fourth year undergoing the intense training for the diploma to help them deal with practical aspects of looking after children. . The training The training includes subjects like how to teach maths to pre-schoolers, how to get a fussy eater to eat, and how you might decorate a nursery for an eco-conscious couple. The first ward of the trainees is a doll baby which cries and wets themselves like a real baby. The nannies watch them as part of their training and take them to their rooms overnight so they can learn to cope with crying infants in the early hours. They have to complete  hours of newborn experience with real babies. There are also lessons on how to organise a sleep over, birthday parties and how to get a child into a good sleeping routine along with how to deal with a temper tantrum.  . The skills Students do two hours of cookery classes each week and two hours of sewing, other professional skills like time management, how to work in a team and communication skills. They also become highly resourceful, knowing how to keep a child entertained. . The nannies are taught Taekwondo As most of the nannies will work for some of the most high-powered families in the world, the college equips them with specialised training to deal with a whole range of scenarios - including dangerous ones. One of the newer additions to the curriculum has been security and anti-terrorism training provided by former British military intelligence officers. The half day course focuses on how to minimise risks to children, including how to stop a skidding car in aposskid-panapos driving. Taekwondo is provided by a black belt and teaches the nannies how to protect a child in a pram, walking or in a buggy. The course is designed to make the nannies more vigilant to any attack and includes lessons on how to deal with cyber security.  . Norlanders can make a lot of money Norlanders have excellent job prospects and their predicted salary range for a residential nanny working  hours a week in London is £, to £, depending on experience. Famous clients include Mike Jagger, Princess Anne along with the Sussexaposs. . They are taught etiquette There is an eight-week program at the end of the course which includes a workshop on social etiquette run by Debretts - the etiquette specialists who teach people how to address someone with a title, how to eat correctly, and good body language.

David Cunningham, , was told he would not make it to  unless he changed his unhealthy lestyle. David, from Galway, Ireland, would eat  takeaways a week while working nights in a casino, and at his heaviest weighed  stone. He was given the crucial advice after suffering a back injury. David told RSVP Live: “I used to play American football with the Galway team and I hurt my back. I didn’t realise how bad it was at the time, but I damaged two discs and I couldn’t walk.I was on crutches for about six months.”    While waiting for an appointment for surgery, David’s doctor told him he probably wouldn’t survive the operation due to his size, and he also wouldn’t be able to fit in the machine for an MRI scan. “I was  at the time and the doctor told me ‘ you keep going the way you are, you won’t see . Your body can’t take the pressure you’re putting on it’,” David says. “Literally that day I walked out and got in a taxi and decided there and then I was going to do something about it.”After years of leading an unhealthy lestyle, this was what David needed to hear to kickstart his weight loss.    The next day, he contacted personal trainer Paul Dermody and asked would he be willing to work with him as soon as he no longer needed crutches. David tells us: “Without him, I wouldn’t have done it. At the time I didn’t have any self belief and I needed someone to inspire me.” Through Paul’s encouragement, David’s le began to change for the better. Slowly but surely, he began attending the gym up to four times a week and would aim to walk , steps a day. In terms of diet, David says he now eats much healthier, however he will treat himself to the odd takeawayhe wants to.  He says when he started to lose weight, “I still ate everything I wanted, just a lot less of it. “My diet when I worked in the casino was terrible, I’d probably eat about seven to ten takeaways a week. So at the start I cut down from ten takeaways a week to about four - I didn’t eliminate all the bad stuff straight away because I wouldn’t have had the willpower to do that. “Cutting out two pizzas and four McDonald’s a week to just brown rice and vegetables wasn’t going to happen. But ten cans of Coke a week would go to five, and so on, and I started to eat less junk food.” “I was told not to eliminate anything because I was eating , calories a day - going to , calories a day eating nothing but fish and broccoli wasn’t going to work.

It comes after Shamima gave an interview this week saying she hates ISIS and wants to come home. Begum, , was one of three schoolgirls to have fled London to join ISIS fighters in Syria in . In a new interview this week, Shamima said her mental health is suffering after losing her three children and she needs help. But the Home Secretary Priti Patel told The Sun there was no way, no way Shamima couldhome. Ms Patel said it was quite reassuring to see Begum was still living in a camp in war-torn Syria.    She said: Our job is to keep our country safe. We donapost need people who have done harm and left our country to be part of a death cult and to perpetuate that ideology. We cannot have people who would do us harm allowed to enter our country - and that includes this woman. Everything I see in terms of security and intelligence, I am simply not willing to allow anybody who has been an active supporter or campaigner for IS in this country. Begum married Dutch-born Yago Riedijk shortly after leaving the UK and said her purpose was to make babies. She hasnapost spoken to her family since she left home and says they are angry at her for leaving and for speaking to the media. Shamima wants toto the UK and stand trial in her home country. But Ms Patel said: “We don’t want you in our court system or our prisons.”   Her citizenship was revoked by the then Home Secretary Sajid Javid when she resurfaced in a refugee camp earlier this year.She was heavily pregnant at the time and begged to be allowed tohome. She gave birth to a son named Jarrah who died days later. It is claimed she served in the Islamic Stateaposs morality police, stitched suicide bombersapos vents and actively tried to recruit other women to join the jihadist group, before the caliphateaposs collapse. Shamima now lives in a new camp in Syria, whose name can loosely be translated as Camp Sunshine. She shares a tent with a Canadian woman who is  years older than her and they have a TV where they can watch the news and even some movies - including the new Men in Black and Spider Man movies. Shamima says watching TV is a form of escape for her and she also spends her time listening to pop music.

However,your committee man hadn’t intervened, and was so certain it was  goals, I would have recorded  goals scored by the Harp.’“Speechless, they stared at each other, before the ref broke the silence: ‘Sorry lads, but the score cannot be changed’.“O’Kane nodded, and the Harp lads bade the referee a good day. They trudged down the tenement stairs and into the street.“And, as it was Sunday in  Dundee, there was nowhere to sip on a shandy and commiserate with each other.“Dundee Harp is long deceased, but there are DNA remnants of that pioneering football club within Dundee United.“And Arbroath FC lives on alongside its famous Abbey, its famous Smokies, its famous Bell Rock Lighthouse and famed world record football score.”Rob finished off with a reference back to his opening lines in the first part of his trilogy: “If a script and movie were to be planned, I’m thinking Brian Cox, David Tennant, Ewan McGregor and James McAvoy for the leading roles.“The title would be The Greatest Score on Earth.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1f2bfd572859.71439938-e1562337997332-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united coach mcculloch praises shankland but says whole team have played part","story":"Dundee United No  Lee McCulloch is happy to see Lawrence Shankland grabbing the headlines but insists there are plenty unsung heroes in their ranks.United mounted a late fight back, with Shankland scoring twice, to down Arbroath - at Tannadice on Saturday.And former striker Lee was pleased to see the ex-Ayr hitman continue his rich vein of scoring form.However, he believes it has been a team effort to keep the Terrors top of the Championship pile at this stage of the season.“Everybody is talking about Shanks and rightly so after getting those two goals but I also think the midfielders deserve enormous credit,” Lee said.“The build-up play and balls in for both goals were excellent.“I think Shanks has grabbed the headlines but I would prefer the credit to be spread about the team for the fight back. That’s just football – the goalscorers get the headlines.“Shanks is big enough and ugly enough to deal with the pressure that comes with starting the season so well. He has looked asit has not fazed him.“As a coaching staff, you do want goals to be spread around the team and that will mean centre-halves having to convert set-plays, midfielders to chip in and wingers to be nipping in at the back post to score.“In an ideal world you would like that and we had that in the Dundee derby. That was the perfect scenario so, hopefully, we can get back to that.“I don’t think, however, that we can take anything away from Lawrence and play down how good he has been considering every new singing is a gamble.“He has been perfect for us so far.”Former Rangers, Wigan and Motherwell forward Lee also heaped praise on young striker Louis Appere for his performances to date.And the former Killie gaffer believes the -year-old is already a better player than he was at that age.“I think he is a wee bit better than me, to be honest,” Lee added. “I would say that, especially at the age he is at.“I am a big fan of Louis. He has the pace, ability and the stature.“I can only see him kicking on because he has a fantastic attitude.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d88933ceb4769.54724060-e1569239377405.jpg ","title":"moment of madness cost dundee against morton says gaffer mcpake","story":"Dundee manager James McPake was today lamenting a “moment of madness” which cost them in Saturday’s - defeat at Morton.Peter Grant’s headed goal on the stroke of half-time won the points in the end at Cappielow.And boss James was left frustrated after Cammy Kerr gave away the free-kick which led to the goal and failed to pick up Ton centre-half Grant in the box.“I thought, for the first  minutes of the game, we defended exceptionally well,” he said.“We knew, especially with John Sutton playing, what was going to happen and, credit to them, they did it very well.“I thought my defenders stood up and I have been very critical of them at times, particularly in a game which we lost heavily.“They stood up well and handled everything that was coming into the box but then a moment of madness a minute before half-time costs us the game.“You give away a silly free-kick when the guy is  yards from your goal on the touchline facing his own goal. Then you lose your man for the goal.“We’ve got to give Morton credit. I thought they were decent at what they do and that’s why they’ve had a decent start in the league.“We knew and we said ‘don’t give away daft free-kicks’ but there are times you can’t help give away a free-kick or put it out for a throw-in.“We worked all week to deal with them but a player gets a rush of blood to the head and it cost us the game, which is unfortunate for us because I think the players worked ever so hard.“They gave me everything and I couldn’t have asked for any more in terms of effort and endeavour to go and do it.“We got people on the pitch to go and do it and get us back in the game but, in the end, it’s a poor goal that’s cost us in that game.”Stepping into the breach for Ton’s suspended manager David Hopkin, No  Anton McElhone was happy with his side’s performance as they leapfrogged Dundee into fourth spot.“We said that before, we’ve got a really good team that probably doesn’t get as much attention at times but we should,” he said.“Our budget, everything’s against us, but the lads put in a sht every week.“It was a great time to score a goal and we weathered the storm in the second half against a very talented Dundee team.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"tayside teen who plays for scotland is a rising star in the world of hockey","story":"Ellie Stott is a star of the hockey world who is rising fast.The -year-old attends Kilgraston School and turns out for them as well as for Grove Menzieshill, one of Scotland’s top ladies sides.She has been part of their side which has gained a whole host of success.A Scotland U  and U  player, Ellie has also turned out for the senior Scottish Indoor side.Older sister Katie and mum Pauline are also successful hockey players.In fact, all three turned out in one game for Grove Menzieshill.

new exhibition is to showcase work of those who inspire the next generation of north-east artists.Staff Outing, which is open from today, highlights those working within Robert Gordon University’s Gray’s School of Art Contemporary Art Practice department.It is also an opportunity for students and members of the public to learn more about the professional practice of the staff at the university, and see the techniques, skills and ideas behind the teaching of the contemporary art degree.Staff Outing is open from tonight until October  at the Look Again Project Space on St Andrew Street.Look Again co-director Hilary Nicoll said: “Staff Outing provides a unique opportunity for the talented and creative staff at Gray’s School of Art to showcase their own artistic practices to fellow academics, students and the general public.“The team from the Contemporary Art Practice department spend a large amount of their time teaching and inspiring the next generation of artists in the studios at the art school, so this will be a great chance for them to demonstrate their inidual professional practices as artists.“A key priority for the university is in the cultural development of the region and we believe events such as this can really add to the creative economy in the north-east.”Staff Outing will include artwork in a range of dferent mediums, including prints, sculpture and multi-media.There will also be a programme of performances, talks and events.David Blyth, contemporary art practice course leader, is one of those exhibiting his work.He said: “We want to be seen as makers as well as teachers, so there is an element of changing perceptions about who we are and how our students and the public see us.“We see Staff Outing as very much a learning tool, where we will be delivering seminars, talks and workshops in the space.“We are trying to make this as much of a ‘real world’ scenario as we can.“It’s important to get across that we are not existing in a vacuum, and we work in real time in the real world.”David added that he thought it was important that as teachers, they must not forget the importance of their practice, as it helps to enhance the student experience.He added: “It is a real strength and a big advantage to the students for us to be practicing.“The success of the course also depends on our success as practicing artists.“The reputation of the course increases and the learning experience is improved.”Alongside David, other artists taking part in the exhibition include Michael Agnew, Jim Buckley, Chris Fremantle, Jim Hamlyn, Cameron Ross and Maja Zeco.There are also graduates in residence taking part, including Megan Devenny, Valentina Lauto and Emily Strachan.It is open tonight from pm until pm, and then again every Friday, Saturday

The people we’ve spoken to say they don’t want to pay to park to just drop off a parcel.“As a small business, we are missing out because people now need to pay to park to come and see us.”Mike said staff had been brainstorming ideas to help encourage more people to visit the shop.He added: “The car park is across the road, sopeople are looking to buy a bottle of wine, we would be happy to refund their parking.“We can give people something back and thank them for taking the time to come visit us.”Councillor Peter Argyle, infrastructure services committee chairman, urged people to make full use of Aberdeenshire town centres.He said: “The new tarf was introduced to end an unsustainable deficit in the car park budget.“We have not extended pay and display so there are still a huge number of spaces for which we do not charge at all.“It would be disappointingpeople were to avoid Inverurie because of an erroneous message that parking there is expensive or dficult – it is neither.“I would encourage everyone to make full use of our excellent town centres.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLet#s face it.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

The centre was inspired by Catherine and her husband John after their experiences when John contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome.#I thought the notion of collecting crisp packets was brilliant, said Catherine, so I mentioned it to Michael one day.##Catherine suggested the crisp packet idea to me one day when I was in the Salty Dog Cafe,# explained Michael.After discussing it with teachers it was all systems go.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

Donrsquot speak to that squirrel wersquove no time to talk.But of course we do live in a magic world, a world just as magical as any story world. Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of land owned by Muirfield Grove residents for approval before building begins.It also added an additional condition asking for a Construction Method Statement to be submitted prior to work beginning amid concerns about access to the site which is through a narrow C-class road and reports of heavy construction vehicles parking off site.A third additional condition, addressing the local authorityrsquos recent pledge to take action against a climate emergency, called for a report on actions taken to reduce carbon emissions on the site to be submitted.Following the meeting, Councillor Findlay, who was the sole member to vote against approving the plans, said: ldquoIam very disappointed with the decision of the planning committee in approving Calarsquos application for detailed planning permission for Saltcoats Field despite the fact that, in my opinion, it falls far short of fulfilling Policy T of the Local Development Plan  in terms of connectivity to the rest of the village.ldquoI am also disappointed that it did not approve of my proposed amendment to delay permission until connectivity issues have been sorted out as, at present, the two proposed pedestrian

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5679168.jpg?type=article-full","title":"north-coast-500-bought-scotlands-biggest-landowner","story":"IT was set up by Prince Charles with the aim of promoting the most remote parts of the Scottish mainland and attracting visitors to savour its beauty.The North Coast  project, which uses  miles of existing roads to create a circular tour of the coast, is five years old and has been hailed for boosting tourism.But now the countryrsquos largest private landowner, Danish fashion tycoon Anders Hoch Povlsen, has taken control of the route from Prince Charlesrsquo North Highland Initiative and saw it make a loss in the first year.North Coast  Ltd has promoted the north Highlands tourist route as a ldquoglobal phenomenon attracting thousands of visitors.It was launched by the North Highland Initiative to breathe new le into some of the remotest and most economically fragile areas of the Highlands.It amounted to a rebranding of a road system that had existed for decades, starting at Inverness, heading west to Applecross, Gairloch and Ullapool before heading along the north coast through Durness and Wick and back to Inverness.It incorporates many narrow, twisting roads, including the steepest single-track stretch in the British Isles, at Bealach na Bagrave.The NC passport, which visitors can have stamped at participating attractions along the way, recommends stops at ldquowindswept beaches and fairytale castles, as well as distilleries, smokehouses and farm shops.North Coast  Ltd, a privately funded company whose aim was to grow the routersquos brand, had been controlled by the Initiative.It has now emerged the company is controlled by Wildland Ventures Limited, established in  by Anders and Anne Holch Povlsen as a vehicle for taking forward the conservation, protection and sustainable development of some of Scotlandrsquos most rugged, precious and beautul landscapes.According to Wildlandrsquos latest accounts, the ultimate parent company is Mr Povlsenrsquos Denmark-based investment firm Heartland A S after taking a majority stake from NHI.In the year to March, , North Coast  Ltd made a pound, deficit following a pound, loss from the year before, when the Initiative had control.Following its creation and development, North Coast  Ltd received private investment, although NHI had remained a signicant investor.Stirling University researcher Gary Woodcock, who found people living along the scenic North Coast  tourist route wanted to move house because of disruption caused by visitors, said the change in control could be of benefit to the locals.Mr Woodcock, an expert in sustainable tourism, added: ldquoIt has the potential to change the dynamic between the promoters of the route and the communities along its course, but onlythe future plans have residents at their heart and, thus, are in communication with and listening to communities.ldquoI imagine the residents of the north-west Highlands will be looking on with intrigue to find out Mr Povlsonrsquos intentions, but also to the results of the recent survey carried out by the local authority regarding peoplersquos opinions on, and feasibility of, introducing a tourist tax to the region.In August it was estimated that a Highland tourist tax could raise up to pound million pounds a year, according to council officials. The estimate was released as Highland Council began a public consultation on the controversial plan.The North Highland Initiative did not respond to questions surrounding the reasons for NHI relinquishing control of the NC company and what it meant for its operation.But a spokesman accentuated the positives of the operation and how it had benefited the region.He said: ldquoThe aim was to create a self-funding, self-sustaining commercial company that could continue to promote the North Highlands through the North Coast  brand.ldquoNorth Coast  Ltd was founded in January  to do just that and to deliver enhanced opportunities for businesses and communities throughout the area.ldquoPotential investors expressed an interested in supporting the aims and objectives of the initial concept and subsequently converted that interest into a shareholding.ldquoThe loss for the year demonstrates the need for the company to invest in people and resourceswe are to continue to drive the socio-economic benefits to the North Highlands.ldquoThere is clear evidence why we should continue to do this as the investment to date has created outstanding impacts for many businesses in the North Highlands and has put the region on a global .ldquoThe Board are aware of the challenges of being the creators of a new model of tourism development and the associated monetisation of the brand and will continue to be innovative in developing income streams and cost efficiency.The NHI has previously said that its use of tourism ldquoas a vehicle for creating sustainable communities resulted in the creation of NC, ldquowidely regarded by the media and experts as the number one touring route in the world.It said that the -mile route around the north coast has attracted an audience of . billion people around the globe in  and is credited with creating an additional  jobs in its first year of operation.Further to that, it said an economic impact survey revealed that the creation of the route added an additional poundm to the North Highland economy in .The Danish billionaire, who is also the chief executive and sole owner of the international clothes retailer chain Bestseller, like hundreds of thousands of other tourists who visit the Highlands every year, was captivated by its rugged beauty when he visited for an angling holiday with his parents in the s.Two decades later, the second-largest inidual private landowner in the UK, the biggest in Scotland, ed to the country he had fallen in love with ndash but this time with the aim of buying up parts of the countryMr Povlson, who is reportedly worth pound.billion bought the ,-acre Glenfeshie estate in the Cairngorms for poundm in .The estatersquos Glenfeshie Lodge, which was built in about , continues to serve as Mr Povlsenrsquos private Highland home, and has featured in films and TV series including The Crown and The Queen.He was struck by tragedy earlier this year when three of his four children, Alma, Agnes, and Alfred were killed at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo during the  Sri Lanka Easter bombings while they were on holiday there.Mr Povlson is the ingle biggest single shareholder in the Asos online retailer, and his we have continued to snap up huge swathes of the Scottish countryside.They are said to now own about , acres across  estates which he hopes to join together and rewild.In Tongue, Sutherland, the couple have renovated two properties with a third, Lundies House manse,in the process of being refurbished.The Povlsonrsquos have also bought a shop to keep the community thriving.Wildlands have also advertised jobs to assist them in running high-end guest houses in the north to meet the needs of the growing tourist market drawn to the area by the North Coast ."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"LABOURrsquoS conference may have ended tolerably, but it started with an almighty row about a bid to depose deputy leader Tom Watson.

But the Indyref was never like this. There may have been a deal of bad language and anger on the fringes of the internet, where Yoons and Cybernats clashed by night, but never in parliament.The Commons went slightly mad last week, with hysterical finger pointing, tears and shouting. It was like a class of unruly school-kids in the middle of a sugar rush. Please miss: he called me a liar. No, I didnt. Yes, you did. Well, you started it by calling me a traitor. Miss! Miss! Only there was no one able to control this rowdy collection of over-wrought political egos, least of all the Speaker.So, who did start it  Well, Boris Johnson by deploying his rebarbative, war-time rhetoric. Calling the Benn Act the ldquoSurrender Act. Accusing MPs of being ldquotraitors, ldquobetraying the people. It was demeaning, even for him. But Im not going to apportion blame exclusively to the Prime Minister. Everyone has lost the plot over Brexit ndash not least Labour MPs, who repeatedly accuse Johnson of being a ldquoracistand a ldquotin pot dictator staging a ldquocoup.Why did the Labour MP Paula Sherrf think it wise to invoke the murdered MP, Jo Cox, in this cauldron of bile  It was a crude attempt to link Boris Johnsons ldquosurrender rhetoric, the far right, and a racist murder, ashe were somehow morally responsible. Johnson didnt help by responding that the ldquobest way to honour Jo Cox would be to get Brexit done. That was patently absurd, tasteless and inappropriate.But the reaction was even more hysterical. Youd have thought hed actually called for more MPs to be murdered. The Labour MP Jess Phillips accosted the Prime Minister in the lobby, demanding that he apologise for saying it was \"humbug to claim that his use of ldquoSurrender Act was an incitement to violence. Really  Apologise for using the word ldquohumbug This is how stupid, tangential rows erupt on social media ndash where everyone you disagree with becomes a fascist, and people get drunk on synthetic outrage. They all need to get a grip dial down the rhetoric stop playing to the Twitter gallery.Im tempted to suggest calling Lady Hale, the Spider Woman, along to sort this mess out. The -year-old president of the Supreme Court became an unlikely superhero last week after she unprorogued parliament and ruled that the PM had acted unlawfully. But shes a judge, who lives in the rarefied atmosphere of the Inns of Court, not the Commons bear pit.We dont yet know the full implications of last weeks Supreme Court ruling, except that they will profound. It amounted to, as the former Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, put it: ldquoa revolution. This is because the court ruled on whether the government had acted with ldquoreasonable justication in suspending parliament for five weeks. It may sound odd, but no one has expected governments to behave reasonably before.The English High Court had earlier ruled that the courts had no right to get involved in policy, and that was what most people believed. Butjudges are going to get involved in detailed political decision-making, then the Supreme Court will itself become politicised. It already is. There are calls for its judges to be subject to political vetting, as in America.Labour MPs and supporters were jubilant after Lady Hales ruling. But they may not be celebrating when Labour are next in government. They may find courts questioning policies like nationalisation and the abolition of private schools. Radical parties of the Left generally have more to fear from judicial activism than Conservatives. As do nationalists. Look at Catalonia, where politicians really are in jail because the Spanish supreme court ruled an independence referendum illegal. Couldnt happen here  Im beginning to wonder.But thats all for the future. The immediate problem is how this wretched Brexit crisis is to be resolved before real warfare breaks out. We should be thankful, perhaps, that the only punches thrown so far have been verbal ones. We havent yet had any Gilet Jaunes-style civil disobedience and rioting. But the country is on a kne edge and it is the duty of parliament to deal with this crisis, not become part of it.The Prime Minister has a majority of minus , has behaved unlawfully, and is refusing to honour the Benn Act, which requires him to ask for a third extension of Article . Former PM John Major has warned that Mr Johnson might resort to jiggery pokery in the Privy Council to overturn the Benn Act. He is anyway refusing to sign what he calls the ldquosurrender letter to Brussels.The rebel alliance, led by the brilliant SNP MP Joanna Cherry QChave their own solution. Cherry has filed a legal challenge under what is called ldquoNobile Officium ndash a legal device that allows the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sign and send the letter to Brussels on the Prime Ministers behalf.Theres nothing like it in English law. So why would a Scottish court interfere  Well, as it happens, rulings of Scottish courts apply across the entire UK, as a consequence of the Act of Union. The Government could appeal, of course, and the matter could end up back in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale is no doubt sharpening her quill pen as we speak.Nobile Officium is ingenious, but it would surely be all Dominic Cum-mings Christmases coming at once. The idea of Scottish judges signing away British sovereignty, as he might put it, and reversing the Brexit referendum, as he would also put it, would be an ideal curtain-raiser for a General Election. The people versus the Establishment.It would also get Boris Johnson off the hook of having to actually sign the ldquosurrender missive. Instead, he might just make clear to the European Union, that he will not cooperate. He will not appoint a British EU Commissioner, will not discuss the financial implications, will empty-chair summits. Parliament can force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension, but it cant force him to do so in good faith.MPs have one obvious solution: which is to get rid of him by a vote of No Confidence. Put this zombie administration out of its misery. This wouldnt mean that Boris gets to call his early General Election, as many people seem to believe. The Commons has  days to chose a caretaker administration, and negotiate the extension themselves. But MPs cant seem to agree even on this.It is partly because the parties are hopelessly ided over Brexit ndash having voted against Mays deal, a referendum, or revoking A, the lot.

But the Indyref was never like this. There may have been a deal of bad language and anger on the fringes of the internet, where Yoons and Cybernats clashed by night, but never in parliament.The Commons went slightly mad last week, with hysterical finger pointing, tears and shouting. It was like a class of unruly school-kids in the middle of a sugar rush. Please miss: he called me a liar. No, I didnt. Yes, you did. Well, you started it by calling me a traitor. Miss! Miss! Only there was no one able to control this rowdy collection of over-wrought political egos, least of all the Speaker.So, who did start it  Well, Boris Johnson by deploying his rebarbative, war-time rhetoric. Calling the Benn Act the ldquoSurrender Act. Accusing MPs of being ldquotraitors, ldquobetraying the people. It was demeaning, even for him. But Im not going to apportion blame exclusively to the Prime Minister. Everyone has lost the plot over Brexit ndash not least Labour MPs, who repeatedly accuse Johnson of being a ldquoracistand a ldquotin pot dictator staging a ldquocoup.Why did the Labour MP Paula Sherrf think it wise to invoke the murdered MP, Jo Cox, in this cauldron of bile  It was a crude attempt to link Boris Johnsons ldquosurrender rhetoric, the far right, and a racist murder, ashe were somehow morally responsible. Johnson didnt help by responding that the ldquobest way to honour Jo Cox would be to get Brexit done. That was patently absurd, tasteless and inappropriate.But the reaction was even more hysterical. Youd have thought hed actually called for more MPs to be murdered. The Labour MP Jess Phillips accosted the Prime Minister in the lobby, demanding that he apologise for saying it was \"humbug to claim that his use of ldquoSurrender Act was an incitement to violence. Really  Apologise for using the word ldquohumbug This is how stupid, tangential rows erupt on social media ndash where everyone you disagree with becomes a fascist, and people get drunk on synthetic outrage. They all need to get a grip dial down the rhetoric stop playing to the Twitter gallery.Im tempted to suggest calling Lady Hale, the Spider Woman, along to sort this mess out. The -year-old president of the Supreme Court became an unlikely superhero last week after she unprorogued parliament and ruled that the PM had acted unlawfully. But shes a judge, who lives in the rarefied atmosphere of the Inns of Court, not the Commons bear pit.We dont yet know the full implications of last weeks Supreme Court ruling, except that they will profound. It amounted to, as the former Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, put it: ldquoa revolution. This is because the court ruled on whether the government had acted with ldquoreasonable justication in suspending parliament for five weeks. It may sound odd, but no one has expected governments to behave reasonably before.The English High Court had earlier ruled that the courts had no right to get involved in policy, and that was what most people believed. Butjudges are going to get involved in detailed political decision-making, then the Supreme Court will itself become politicised. It already is. There are calls for its judges to be subject to political vetting, as in America.Labour MPs and supporters were jubilant after Lady Hales ruling. But they may not be celebrating when Labour are next in government. They may find courts questioning policies like nationalisation and the abolition of private schools. Radical parties of the Left generally have more to fear from judicial activism than Conservatives. As do nationalists. Look at Catalonia, where politicians really are in jail because the Spanish supreme court ruled an independence referendum illegal. Couldnt happen here  Im beginning to wonder.But thats all for the future. The immediate problem is how this wretched Brexit crisis is to be resolved before real warfare breaks out. We should be thankful, perhaps, that the only punches thrown so far have been verbal ones. We havent yet had any Gilet Jaunes-style civil disobedience and rioting. But the country is on a kne edge and it is the duty of parliament to deal with this crisis, not become part of it.The Prime Minister has a majority of minus , has behaved unlawfully, and is refusing to honour the Benn Act, which requires him to ask for a third extension of Article . Former PM John Major has warned that Mr Johnson might resort to jiggery pokery in the Privy Council to overturn the Benn Act. He is anyway refusing to sign what he calls the ldquosurrender letter to Brussels.The rebel alliance, led by the brilliant SNP MP Joanna Cherry QChave their own solution. Cherry has filed a legal challenge under what is called ldquoNobile Officium ndash a legal device that allows the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sign and send the letter to Brussels on the Prime Ministers behalf.Theres nothing like it in English law. So why would a Scottish court interfere  Well, as it happens, rulings of Scottish courts apply across the entire UK, as a consequence of the Act of Union. The Government could appeal, of course, and the matter could end up back in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale is no doubt sharpening her quill pen as we speak.Nobile Officium is ingenious, but it would surely be all Dominic Cum-mings Christmases coming at once. The idea of Scottish judges signing away British sovereignty, as he might put it, and reversing the Brexit referendum, as he would also put it, would be an ideal curtain-raiser for a General Election. The people versus the Establishment.It would also get Boris Johnson off the hook of having to actually sign the ldquosurrender missive. Instead, he might just make clear to the European Union, that he will not cooperate. He will not appoint a British EU Commissioner, will not discuss the financial implications, will empty-chair summits. Parliament can force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension, but it cant force him to do so in good faith.MPs have one obvious solution: which is to get rid of him by a vote of No Confidence. Put this zombie administration out of its misery. This wouldnt mean that Boris gets to call his early General Election, as many people seem to believe. The Commons has  days to chose a caretaker administration, and negotiate the extension themselves. But MPs cant seem to agree even on this.It is partly because the parties are hopelessly ided over Brexit ndash having voted against Mays deal, a referendum, or revoking A, the lot. But they must take back control,they want to be sure of avoiding a No Deal Brexit. Judges cant do it. Parliament cant do it. Only a government can conduct negotiations with foreign powers. MPs have the power to replace Boris Johnson tomorrow.

But therersquos been a war of words doon in yonder Hoose orsquo Commons, and I have little to say about it beyond the following cogent and authoritative ndash be quiet, madam ndash observations.The stooshie ndash guid Scots word ndash thither was occasioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnsonreferring to a ldquoSurrender Act, vis-a-vis obstructive Remain legislation.The word ldquoRemain is your first clue that the subject is Brexit, and I intend dropping it as swtly as possible. In a nutshell , a referendum occurred in which one side was entirely ignorant about EU matters, did not even know who their MEP was , did not know which body sat in Brussels and which in Strasbourg, and did not know there would have to be multiple deals. And there was another side which voted to Leave.For better or worse, richer or poorer, the Leavers won, occasioning paroxysms of fury among the bourgeois elite, which pushed through the aforementioned legislation to protect our democracy from the voters.Irsquove read the words ldquoSurrender Act forwards. And, liking to be thorough, Irsquove read them backwards. And Irsquom at a loss to see how theyrsquore violent or threatening, as alleged by the opposition. There are connotations of wartime perhaps, though not necessarily so , but it still seems a relatively harmless rhetorical device, issued in the face of a clamour of abuse ndash ldquofascist! ldquodictator! the usual products of careful analysis ndash from hate-fill generaled faces on the benches opposite.I think ldquobetrayal was also used, but there can hardly be a week in which it isnrsquot trotted out. In fact, itrsquos one of the most routinely deployed accusations in politics.As for violent, threatening language, the opposition walked right into a trap as Borisrsquos defenders brought up numerous horrendous examples of Labour members or supporters in particular talking of ldquolynching the b**ch , being admittedly ldquofull of hate, giving someone ldquoa good slapping, ldquogarrotting Danny Alexander, wanting to go back in time and ldquoassassinate Margaret Thatcher, ldquosurrendering the NHS to the US and, of course, calling everybody a Nazi.It was left to that nice man, Jeremy Corbyn , to point out that neither side had a monopoly on virtue.Fortunately, the Commons has no monopoly on Mr Johnsonrsquos time, and it was the prorogue elephantrsquos trumpeted words where that attracted my attention. In New York, for example, he made Iranrsquos President Hassan Rouhani titter by inviting him to a climate change summit in Scotland, saying: ldquoAs you know, Glasgow is lovely in November. Outrageous!Also in the US, he complained about tarfs on socks, averring that ldquosome fibres hellip have to be taken to a laboratory and set fire to twice. Incendiary stuff. On brassicas, he complained that ldquoonly certain ports in the United States are licensed for the import of British caullowers. Lucky United States.At the UN General Assembly, bewildered delegates looked nervously at each other, wonderingthey were supposed to laugh, when the PM compared performing in Parliament to Prometheus having his liver pecked out daily by an eagle. Well, itrsquos arguable, I suppose.Further adventures with words included describing some urban environments as being ldquoas antiseptic as a Zurich pharmacy, and taking the pisces out of the SNP administration in Scotland by calling it ldquofish-abandoning.However, the prize for clever deployment of words goes to the busty blonde tech entrepreneur and ex-model, with a pole-dancing pole in her flat, who described Mr Johnsonrsquos weekly visits as being for ldquotechnology lessons.Technology lessons is sure to replace ldquoUgandan relations at Private Eye as a euphemism for activities of a lewd and libidinous nature.Words, words, words.

Then the age of Margaret Thatcher dawned and with it the worship of consumerism where a fire-sale of British assets lasting three decades created a new class of millionaires and Tory party donors. Thus, getting rich quickly and easily was regarded as a virtue and ordinary people denied the access codes saw the lights go out in their communities.The Labour Party, which had once championed these neighbourhoods, simply gave up the ghost, retiring wounded from the eternal fray after seeing the  election slip from their grasp when it had seemed theirs for the taking. This reversal was the most grievous cut of all as it seemed to signal that its own people had become mesmerised and duped by the bribes of right-to-buy and a few hundred quid from Sid at British Gas.Capitalism had won and there seemed nothing  for it but to fall in behind and loosen the bonds of Clause IV and the dreams of making the profits of industry flow to the many and not the few. The Labour party, primped up and gentried under Tony Blair was a wretched facsimile of the movement which brought the British people homes fit for habitation, free healthcare and access to university education. This one was all about appeasing high finance and the banks by withdrawing scrutiny of their misdeeds and quietly permitting Mrs Thatcherrsquos anti-trade union measures to ride.Socialism, long reviled by the right for giving the masses a glimpse of something glorious, became something pernicious and anti-patriotic once more under Mr Blair and his acolytes whose guiding principles were cashed in for a portfolio of city non-execs and the brush of ermine.In Parliament this week the left, glimpsing perhaps the downfall of a sitting Tory Prime Minister, made a graven idol of an elderly lady with a spider brooch. Later they rose up in righteous fury because Boris Johnson used words like lsquosurrenderrsquo and lsquohumbugrsquo to dismiss calls that he apologise for unlawfully proroguing parliament.This would have comforted a Tory regime which has overseen a one-sided austerity experiment a hostile environment for immigrants and refugees and tax cuts for the UKrsquos most affluent citizens and corporations. Across the UK and especially in its poorest communities thousands of families continue to suffer the effects of Mrs Thatcherrsquos social engineering.Yet here was the left being side-tracked once more, this time by the mere sounds of right-wing contempt. In future, they may come to regret that this contrived outrage at robust and plain speech from the Conservatives may undermine any attempts to express their own justiable anger over Tory attacks on the people they purport to represent.The confetti of their outrage, conveniently for the Tories, masked the messages coming out of the most important Labour Party conference in generations. At Brighton this week the party delivered several crucial policy statements that signalled to its wider membership that delivering for the many and not the few is more than just a slogan.The move to reclaim an authentic Clause IV, the momentous declaration that gives this movement its entire moral purpose, was long overdue. Before the advent of Thatcherism and the concept of profit-before-people, Clause IV was regarded as a reasonable aspiration for working class people who had been forbidden to share in the profits of their labour.ldquoTo secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.This was a challenge to inequality and thus came to be hated by a Tory party that has always thrived on greed and corruption. Thereafter, they relied on the owners of Britainrsquos mass circulation newspapers ndash their former chums at Eton and Oxford ndash to treat this message like a contagion.The Labour conference also pledged to dismantle the UKrsquos private school system, the principal means by which its advocates ensure that fairness is always kept at a safe distance and that unearned wealth will always triumph over hard work and natural ability. Their adoption of a suite of SNP measures to help our most vulnerable citizens and already embedded in Scotlandrsquos social contracts simply underpinned theto its most sacred values.Therersquos a perverse reassurance to be had in observing the behaviour of Boris Johnson at this point when Labour has re-discovered its soul. The Prime Minister has been rebuked by some on his own side for fostering an extreme form of Toryism by casting overboard those who refuse to give him total fealty. He believes himself above the law and treats the UKrsquos democratic institutions with contempt. Accusations of corruption and conflicts of interest seem to embolden him.This has always been the Tory way this is their Clause IV: ldquoto deny the workers the full fruits of their industry and by any means necessary ndash legal or illegal ndash exerting control over each industry or service. What party did these lsquomoderatersquo Tories think they were signing up for  Just as Jeremy Corbyn is re-acquainting Labour with its core values so Mr Johnson is embracing once more the most cherished principles of Conservatism. For the first time in a generation our two main parties are playing the roles originally assigned to them by the constituencies they were sworn to protect. Let honest battle now commence.Brexit must and will happen because a clear majority of English voters committed themselves to it in a clearly-defined campaign.

But the priority is to prevent a no-deal exit, with all the problems this could cause the people of this country.Former chancellor Philip Hammond accused the Prime Minister of failing to negotiate seriously with the EU while the speculators who backed him stood to make a killing inthe event of no-deal.ldquoAs his sister has reminded us, he is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexitndash and there is only one outcome that works for them: a crash-out no-deal Brexit that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring, he wrote in an article for The Times.ldquoSo they, at least, will be reassured to see no evidence at all that his government has seriously pursued a deliverable deal still less that it has been pursuing a deal that could get us out by October .Meanwhile the SNP MP Stewart Hosie said that a no-confidence vote might be the only way to stop no-deal.ldquoWe have to do that because there is now no confidence that the Prime Minister will obey the law and seek the extension that Parliament voted for only a few weeks ago, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.ldquoIf we are serious about the extension, that is the only game in town.So far, opposition leaders have been wary of tabling a confidence vote, fearing Mr Johnson could,he is defeated, simply delay a general election until after October  by which time Britain will be out of the EU.Mr Hosie acknowledgedthe plan could only workan alternative government capable of commanding a Commons majority had been ldquopre-agreed before the vote.However the Liberal Democrats, as well as rebel Tories who had the whip withdrawn, have made clear they that they are not prepared to see Mr Corbyn enter No  as Prime Minister.However Mr Hosie said it was ldquoself-evidently the case that as the leader of the second largest party Westminster, Mr Corbyn should have the first chance of forming an administration.ldquoIf Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems are actually serious about their stopping Brexit position then they need to stop playing political games, get on board with everybody , he said.ldquoAll of the opposition parties and the Tory rebels need to be on board with a single plan.:Boris Johnson could face no-confidence voteldquoIf that is not in place and effectively pre-agreed, then we might end up having the general election on Boris Johnsonrsquos terms, allowing him to run down the clock and crash out without a deal.Mr Corbyn confirmed that in such an event, he would expect to be given the first crack at forming a government with the sole purpose of seeking a Brexit extension and then holding a general election.ldquoThe normal process is that when a government collapses, the leader of the opposition is invited to form a minority government in order to carry through a specic and strictly limited process which would be to ensure no crash-out and to prepare for a general election, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-need-reporters-not-click-bait-merchants","story":"Some colleagues believed it was a valuable exercise that revealed the wider problems facing our industry. Others felt the two-part series did not explore whether the scale of the newsroom cuts had to be made. I fall somewhere in the middle.I should also declare an interest. Despite the kind invitations of the documentary makers, I opted against taking part. Interviews commenced in the wake of the demise of the Sunday Herald, for which I worked for over a decade. Closure was the correct decision ndash the new Herald on Sunday is a fantastic read ndash but I wasnrsquot keen on talking about the old paperrsquos troubled final few weeks.Both episodes ndash Off Stone and Banging Out ndash highlighted the dilemma facing newspapers in the st century. Although the public has a larger appetite than ever for news, these same iniduals are increasingly unwilling to pay for it. Circulations have fallen off a clf over the last decade. Against this backdrop, cuts are inevitable. When I joined the Sunday Herald  years ago, the number of reporters employed was in double figures. At the Herald on Sunday, we were down to two full-timers.En route to work in , a sizeable proportion of passengers would be reading a newspaper purchased moments earlier. These days, my fellow travellers are either reading the or devouring content on their smart-phones. Technology is empowering, but the newspaper world has so far failed to come up with a viable business model for the digi-age. Unless solutions are found, the print media will go the same way as coal mining.The documentary focused on the Herald and National titles, but it could easily have been made about any publishing group in the country. One of the most depressing moments in Scottish journalism in recent years was when the Scotsman downsized from its grand HQ overlooking Arthurs Seat to one of Edinburghrsquos ugliest buildings miles from the Parliament. It is better to make savings from bricks and mortar than staff, but the flit seemed symbolic.A challenge is that ndash and I put this gently ndash newspapers and their journalists are not popular. If a newspaper closes, a chunk of the population will cheer. Politicians, many of whom see the media as a threat rather than an opportunity, would not lt a finger. And nor should they. Ploughing money into a loss-making newspaper would make the loans to Prestwick Airport look like a decent . We are on our own.Part of this troubled relationship with the public can be traced to the Leveson Inquiry. A very small number of iniduals who engaged in criminality ndash phone hacking, blagging ndash tarnished the reputation of an industry that has always done more good than harm. In Scotland, the independence referendum is an added factor. The so-called ldquoBBC bias demos were Trumpian in nature. I also vividly recall a march where a Yes supporter, apropos of nothing, informed me that he wanted the Herald to close. Scrutiny of journalism is valid, but nastiness has become pervasive.Quality journalism, as the documentary showed, is more necessary than ever. There will always be crooks, cheats, liars, expenses fiddlers and others up to no good. There will always be matters of huge public concern being discussed in local government and in our sherf courts. We need reporters, not click bait merchants, to cover these subjects. Newspapers are not just businesses, but are a vital part of the democratic process. Fewer journalists is good news for bad politicians.I leave the Herald on Sunday on excellent terms. Since , I was lucky to have worked for editors who were supportive and encouraging. I can recall having two bad days in  years. Over % of my stories were published, a hit rate any hack would accept.

His party will instead be neutral during the election campaign.This stance jarred with remarks made by Leonard, who said during the conference that he supported UK Labour echoing his own pro-Remain stance.The dfering policies led to Scottish Labour activists contacting this newspaper to express concern that their election literature would be based on Corbynrsquos policy, rather than their own leaderrsquos firmer position. Their fears appear to have been borne out, as a leaflet for activists makes no reference to Scottish Labourrsquos distinctive Brexit policy.Featuring a picture of Leonard and Corbyn, the literature states that ldquoScotland is at a crossroads and slams Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Of the five pledges, the one relating to Brexit echoes the UK party stance: ldquoEnd the Brexit crisis by taking the decision back to the people.The word ldquoRemain is not mentioned anywhere and the other commitments relate to enhancing Holyroodrsquos powers, investing in public services, putting the ldquoplanet before profit and backing a pound-an-hour living wage.However, a party source said Scottish Labour currently has other materials pushing Remain and will have more in the future that highlight this stance and a public vote.Leonard was embroiled in a similar row during the European election campaign, after he was unable to get his picture on one of Labourrsquos leaflets. In a post-election interview, he said: ldquoIrsquove had conversations with Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and we both agree that that was a mistake, because his picture wasnrsquot on the leaflet in Wales either, he said.He added at the time that he had not been involved in the ldquonegotiations over the picture decision.Meanwhile, sources have told this newspaper that the UK partyrsquos grip on Scottish Labour is tightening.

One lesson learned: you need to manage the resources.Stinson rails against the use of ldquomobile gear, a term for dredging and trawling equipment towed behind a boat, which in Scotland can be used right up to the shoreline. ldquoThe most damaging, he says, ldquois the scallop dredge with its teeth and heavy metal bar that digs into the seabed.Since that  visit to Norway, Stinson has been back many times, in a bid not just to fish but to find out what we can learn about how we should be managing our fisheries. Armed with a GoPro camera, he has taken hours of underwater footage and interviewed fishermen, restaurant owners, fish processors and bureaucrats.Among them is Jim Lorentsen, who has owned a fishing boat for  years and talks of how good the fishing is right now. ldquoWe get good prices and a lot of fish, he says. ldquoIt wasnrsquot always like this. In the early s and s it was really bad. They hadnrsquot regulation of the fishing so they used to fish and fish until it stopped. Itrsquos unbelievable how much more fish we see now.Or there is Alf Roald Saeligtre, who runs Cornelius, a destination fish restaurant outside Bergen. ldquoThe main thing here is that we have nobody destroying the seabed, he says. ldquoThey are not allowed to dredge ... The whole approach is ecosystem-based. The last two years in Norway, in the north, we have been beating records. We are fishing extraordinary amounts of cod for fish and chips to England.Stinson says: ldquoMy campaign is to get somebody to acknowledge that the Norwegians have done what we need to do and itrsquos been to the benefit of the coastal communities. One fisherman said lsquoThis is great for us. There are  people on the island of Nesoslashy and  are employed on fishing boats.rsquoHe believes that part of the Norway fish stocks improvement is down to their seabed protection. ldquoResearch supports the idea that the seabeds are crucial habitats in some of the le stages of our larger commercial fish, he points out. ldquoBut in Scotland wersquore destroying spawning grounds. Thatrsquos probably one of the reasons why the herring are not ing. People will say therersquos nothing wrong with scallop dredging, it just needs proper management ndash no it doesnrsquot, it just needs totally eradicated.The research he refers to includes a study by Dr Sophie Elliott linking cod, haddock and whiting survival to seabed bioersity. Itrsquos particularly relevant given last weekrsquos news that, following warnings about precarious cod stock levels, the Marine Stewardship Councilhas removed its blue tick on North Sea cod.Stinson is just one of an older generation of ers who are witnesses to what decades of scallop dredging and bottom trawling have done to the Scottish seabed. His early years of ing were done in the wake of the lting in  of the three-mile limit which prohibited dredgers and trawlers from round our coastlines.But ers are not alone in having such concern. Nick Underdown, of the campaign group Open Seas, believes the government must urgently adopt a precautionary, seaward limit approach that protects the entire coastal zone, similar to the Norwegian one. He observes: ldquoScallop dredging and bottom trawling are regarded as the most damaging fisheries in Europe and yet they continue to have a widespread footprint in Scotlandrsquos inshore waters, suppressing the recovery of our collapsed inshore fish stocks.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos review of these fisheries must account for the damage done to our coastal seabed over the past  years, not just protect a few small areas. By restricting trawlers and dredgers in inshore waters, these businesses would be able to continue in deeper waters, while creating a massive opportunity for low-impact fishing and increase the number of better-paid jobs in the inshore.Alistair Sinclair, national co-ordinator for the Scottish Creel Fishermenrsquos Federation, has long campaigned for aof the three-mile limit. He points to a Scottish Government graph of the drop-off in fish stocks in the Clyde in the period following it. ldquoThe fish stock levels were reasonably healthy in the Clyde and in a short space of time ndash  years ndash they were at ground zero.Sinclair dramatically compares what has been done to our seabed to the ldquorecent burning of the Amazon forest. ldquoThe decimation that actually has gone on and the degradation on the seabed is unbelievable, unforgivable.But, as Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fisheries Federation says, this is a signicant industry, approaching pound million in value, with many jobs attached. She points out that only % of these are hand-ed and that the vast majority ldquois met through scallops landed from areas that have been fished for many years and that remain productive, so itrsquos clear that that there is room for both types of fishing.Macdonald adds: ldquoThe industry is working through the Scallop Industry Consultative Group on management proposals that cover a number of measures, including licensing. We fully recognise the importance of protecting sensitive marine species, habitats and features, and work closely with government and other stakeholders on issues including evidence-based Marine Protected Areas , and the development of appropriate management measures within MPAs.Stinson, however, wants to see an end to scallop dredging ndash although not immediately. Having worked on a couple of scallop dredgers, he is sympathetic to the fishermen who fear such an abrupt assault on their livelihoods. ldquoI donrsquot think they need to be put out of business overnight. I think it needs to be managed over  years, to shut it down. I would say we need to declare a moratorium on the further issuing of any scallop licensing ndash so no further boats.What he discovered in Norway, he believes, indicates that such measures would, far from being bad for our industry,it to its vibrancy. ldquoMobile-gear defenders always say we couldnrsquot compensate for the jobs which would be lostdredging was banned, but they have themselves destroyed the jobs of others by their destructive practice. As scallop dredging declines you would see a rise in other populations and other types of fishing would become economically possible.Why our North Sea cod is off the menu. The North Sea cod fishery was given its blue sustainability label too early. When, in , the MSC awarded it sustainability status there were actually fewer fish than the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea had calculated. Stocks had not fully recovered. As Robin Cook of the University of Strathclyde put it in an article in The Conversation this week, ldquoNow ICES has revised its earlier estimates, showing that the cod recovery plan should never have been abandoned.\". We need to pay more attention to cod habitats.The seabed really does matter for a species which inhabits inshore areas during their le, commercial inshore species like cod. Dr Sophie Elliott, lead author on a University of Glasgow study which linked cod survival to seabed bioersity, observes, ldquoThe problem about the way we undertake quotas and stocks assessments is that we just look at the fish abundance but we donrsquot take into consideration their habitat, where they live. Habitat is one of the largest factors that effects species survival, so by not taking it into account yoursquore just looking at half the picture and you can have super crashes in populations.Essential habitats such as where the fish spawn and also their nursery grounds should be focus areas for protection and stock regeneration. ldquoYou need to be able to understand what these are, where they are, to be able to provide a greater protection.\". Climate-change is having an impact. Fish species are migrating north."},{"url":null,"title":"mackintosh-property-passes-water-pistol-test","story":"This summer the National Trust for Scotland erected a chain mail mesh around the Hill House in Helensburgh to stop it dissolving \"like a sugar cube\".The property is considered the architects domestic masterpiece, but due to its experimental design and materials it has been soaking up water \"like a sponge\" for more than  years.Members of the public were invited to bring water pistols and \"Douse the House\" to test whether the . million chain mail rings were doing their job.Caroline Smith, operations manager at the Hill House, said: \"The mesh worked perfectly and despite the efforts of the finest collection of water pistol sharp shooters Ive ever seen, not one drop got to the house.\"The rain gauges we placed inside the mesh next to the building were bone dry, which is more than can be said for some of the people doing the shooting.\"It was great to be able to show that the box is really doing what it was designed to do and thank you to everyone who came along to take part in our experiment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"food waste really can power cars like in the 1980s back to the future movies","story":"Just as Marty McFly and the Doc discovered in Back to the Future, our food waste can be transformed into a sustainable fuel to power future energy needs.So environmental organisation Zero Waste Scotland is using this year’s Recycle Weekto raise awareness of the potential energy that can be captured by simply placing peelings, egg shells, tea bags and any uneaten produce in household food recycling caddies.The time travelling DeLorean used in the classic s movies was modied to run on food waste – and the technology now exists to use it today to power vehicles, heat our homes and grow more food.Estimates from Zero Waste Scotland reveal that , tonnes of global warming CO equivalent gas would be saved from entering the environmenteveryone in Scotland with access to a food caddy recycled their tea bags. Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

We were contacted by the show on Sunday and the next morning we were on the This Morning sofa.“We had so much more we wanted to say but it was tight for time but so nice to continue to be able to talk about Hannah.

I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38538473.ece/e76dc/BINARY/lia%20Cruise%20Ship%206.jpg","title":"belfasts biggest visitor megaship msc meraviglia thats the weight of four titanics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

dedicates last run memory","story":"A Derry man who has been running competitively for the past forty years will take part in his last full marathon next month in memory of former club member, Martin Gallagher.Harry McNulty is one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club and a familiar face in the local running circuit.At the age of  he has decided to bow out of full marathons but will continue to compete in shorter distances and will no doubt be seen sporting the famous purple colours of his club as he treks through the streets of Derry or tackles the back roads of Donegal.He grew up in Melmore Gardens, Creggan, and now resides in the Waterside area of the city.The -year-old has run  half marathons and will compete in his st, and final, full marathon on October  in Dublin.Harry comes from a family of seven, five boys and two girls, and his brothers Dessie and Brendan were considered the runners in the family. Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the

the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pump track wales uks largest split track opens rhayader","story":"Kirsty Williams AM tries her hand on one of the bicycles following the opening oltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtf the Wales Pump Traltspan classtruncate-full-screengtck together with some of the cycling enthusiasts present.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Castlewellan High School closed in  when it merged with Killyleagh and Quoile high schools to form Down Academy mdash now Blackwater integrated College mdash in Downpatrick.Mr McLean said staff would continue to give pupils ldquothe best possible education until the school closes its doors for the final time.ldquoI have been here for  years.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision.

In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town.

However, they have not faced any side as good as Darragh yet and Jody McGovern, Jack Haughey, Niall Rafferty, Conor Donnelly and Kevin Hegarty will have to be at their best and then somethey are to get the better of Darragh.Glenn, seen as many punditsrsquo favourites to win the competition, then take on St Johnrsquos in what promises to be another close encounter.Glenn may not have made the impact on Division  as they would have liked, but they have been impressive in championship outings against Liatroimand Saul, winning all three games in style.St Johnrsquos have been as equally impressive and wins over Annaclone, Drumgath and Teconnaught have taken them to the brink of a final.The Johnnies will again rely on the firepower of John Clarke, Marty Keenan, Danny and Chris McKay and Conor Morgan to get them over the line, but they must beware the attacking abilities of Mattie Bagnall, Denis Murtagh, Jarlath McConaghy, Jack McCartan and Patrick Brooks.The top clash of the weekend at Pairc Esler on Saturday night then takes centre stage with Clonduff out to ruinrsquos Kilcoorsquos double bid.Kilcoo, who are sitting pretty at the top of Division , look certain to regain their ACFL crown, but nothing less than winning the Frank OrsquoHare Cup will do a hungry Magpies camp.However, you have to admire Kilcoorsquos resilience and fortitude. The Branagan brothers just never know when they are beaten and when you have Conor Laverty buzzing on the edge of the square, anything can happen.Clonduffrsquos first priority will be to try and stop a supply line into Laverty and the OrsquoHagens, McConvilles and Carrs are in for a busy night of it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Sisters.jpg","title":"Sisters hosting night of music with Community Gospel Choir  ","story":"THE countdown is on to this Saturday eveningrsquos fundraising concert in Downpatrick in aid of Cancer Focus NI.Sisters Emma and Evie Telford are busy with the final preparations for the event in memory of their mum Lorna who passed away just over five years ago.The concert mdash which is being held at the Quoile Bar and Bistro at the Strangford Road in the town mdash starts at .pm.Emma and Evie have organised a number of fundraising events in memory of their mum to support Cancer Focus NI, a charity which was of great comfort and help to them in the run-up to their mumrsquos passing and after her death.A non-smoker, Mrs Telford died on September , , following a long battle with lung cancer.The Downpatrick sisters are keen to give something back to a charity which helped them, with the money they raise being used to support the Cancer Focus Family Support Service.Emma and Evie want to help other children and young people who will have to deal with the devastating news that their mum or dad is terminally ill.ldquoWe want to raise money for Cancer Focus because the charity means so much to us.

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets.

It doesn’t matter where the conversation begins — it always ends up in the same place.”That process had been clear since the referendum campaign. But any hope that either the passage of time or a new prime minister would see Westminsterto its historical equilibrium has not been realised..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Rather, the isions are becoming more entrenched. Some of the outworkings of that have been almost darkly comical to those familiar with Northern Ireland politics.When Boris Johnson announced a month ago that Parliament would be prorogued for five weeks, Labour shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis said that “the police will have to remove us from the chamber” evoking images of the late Ian Paisley being carried out of Stormont in  after the dissolution of the Prior Assembly.Lewis also said that “we will call on people to take to the streets”, a watered-down version of Paisley’s words the morning after being dragged out of Parliament Buildings when he warned that “there’s only one answer when you leave the ballot box — it’s a show of force” and told journalists that “this could come to hand to hand fighting in every street ... we’re on the verge of civil war”.Ultimately, Lewis voluntarily left the chamber – itself reminiscent of how some of the wilder rhetoric of Ulster’s political leaders was later quietly dropped.This week has seen ferocious linguistic warfare between the two Brexit tribes in Westminster, reflecting the fissure in the country.The Times’ experienced political editor, Francis Elliott, said of Wednesday’s parliamentary exchanges that he “cannot remember hatred being so nakedly expressed by so many and at suchacross the ide”.UTV’s veteran political editor, Ken Reid, recalled the viciousness of Belfast City Hall at the height of the Troubles, saying: “As a young reporter in the s, I watched in amazement as Belfast City Council chamber turned into a bear pit. It was nasty, hateful, threatening and without direction. Last night’s Commons row was strikingly similar. The forthcoming election could be the bitterest ever.”On Thursday night, former BBC Northern Ireland political editor Tom Kelly, who went on to work as Tony Blair’s spokesman in Downing Street, invoked another seminal moment from Northern Ireland’s history. He told The View: “I couldn’t help but be reminded of Terence O’Neill’s old phrase about ‘Ulster stands at the crossroads’. Britain’s at the crossroads...in terms of how it does politics – compromise or confrontation ”Central to Northern Irish politics is the absence of swing voters. There is no discernible cohort of the electorate who might be persuaded to move between unionist and nationalist parties based on their public spending priorities or their health policies or their plans for the education system.Arlene Foster: Brexit referendum result must be respected Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rather, all the movement has come within the two blocs – where voters move between unionist parties or between nationalist parties – or, especially in recent years, between one of the two main tribes and the smaller centrist parties such as Alliance or the Greens.It is that factor which for decades has, with few exceptions, led to electoral reward for those seen to be robust and has punished those who are seem to be open to compromise.It is also logical for parties to overwhelmingly prioritise speaking to their own core support, rather than reaching out to an electorate which is never going to even consider voting for them.In Great Britain, that now means that the keenest battle for voters is not between Labour and the Conservatives but between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party and between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.Theresa May’s style meant that the logical extent of that truth was not explored during her time in office. But, having won the Brexit referendum in similar circumstances, Boris Johnson –and particularly Dominic Cummings – are sufficiently perceptive to realise that the next election will be won on this ground, and sufficiently ruthless to seem prepared for the revolutionary consequences of such a strategy, something at which more traditional conservatives would baulk.For now, there still are people who just want ato normality and some resolution to the Brexit impasse. But the longer that politics is ided in this way, the deeper the isions are likely to become, pushing more and more people to choose a side, thus electorally incentivising the parties to be less and less willing to compromise.Yet, for all the similarities with Northern Ireland politics, there are obvious and profound dferences. There is no religious dimension to the Brexit-Remain argument and despite the constitutional and economic signicance of EU membership, it is not as existential as the question of the very existence of the country.There are also more deeply embedded institutions in Great Britain which are both a brake on political excess and can be a cohesive force. The prorogation of Parliament for a few weeks was met with incredulity which has never manested itself in Belfast over the absence of Stormont for almost , days.The Queen is overwhelmingly respected and thereforeshe decided to address the nation at a moment of acute peril she would carry authority in a way which would not be possible in Northern Ireland.But there are other dferences which could exacerbate the deepening tribal ide. In Northern Ireland there is both a long and a recent memory of the violence which almost inevitably follows the decisive failure of politics. That can be a brake on both politicians and the public, as witnessed by the apparently renewed public acceptance of compromise in the wake of the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee in April. In England, the civil war is too distant to be a check on political disagreements.There is though some hope from Northern Ireland’s recent past. The most stable period constitutionally has been in the near decade of devolution from  to . Despite perennial crises and tribal disputes, in that time support for the status quo soared to record levels as the number of ideologues reduced in the face of a system which at least gave the appearance of working and addressing everyday needs.In that period the DUP began – at least in word – to reach out to Catholic voters in a way which would have been unthinkable, while Martin McGuinness made radical moves such as respectfully shaking hands with the Queen on multiple occasions.But as events since  have demonstrated, when deep isions are established in politics they are dficult to permanently overcome. Decisions taken for tactical party or personal advantage now could have implications for our entire political system for decades to come.try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

In today’s digital world every major company across almost every industry is building software to empower the digital experiences consumers expect. “As more products and services are procured, delivered or operated via the internet, the risk of security breaches by well organised, highly motivated criminals increases daily. “The new centre will include an RD team of software developers to help create new innovative products, along with sales and marketing teams to support the company’s European growth plans.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
