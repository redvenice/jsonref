The South West had the lowest rate, at around one in 25.Elsewhere in the UK, one in 25 people in Wales were estimated to have had coronavirus last week, where the outbreak was found to have shrunk. The rate was also one in 20 in Scotland and Northern Ireland.The national fall brings the ONS\u0027 findings in line with a raft of other official data which all point to a rapidly shrinking fourth wave.There were 94,432 new positive tests logged across the UK yesterday, which marked a 22 per cent fall compared to last Tuesday. Cases have fallen week-on-week on every day since January 6.The ONS\u0027 survey is considered more reliable because it includes people who do not come forward for official testing. It came as Mr Johnson said the legal requirement on people with coronavirus to self-isolate will be allowed to lapse when the regulations expire on March 24, and that date could be brought forward.Plan B measures aimed at tackling the spread of Covid are also to be dropped across England from January 26.The PM told MPs in the House of Commons more than 90 per cent of over-60s across the UK had now had booster vaccines to protect them, and scientists believed the Omicron wave had peaked.He said the Government had taken a \u0027different path\u0027 to much of Europe and the \u0027data are showing that, time and again, this Government got the toughest decisions right\u0027.People will no longer be told to work from home and, from Thursday next week when Plan B measures lapse, mandatory Covid certification will end, Mr Johnson said.The Government will also no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere from next Thursday and they will be scrapped in classrooms from tomorrow. The announcement is the latest move as part of \u0027Operation Red Meat\u0027 - a policy blitz cooked up by Number 10 in a bid to win back the support of Tory MPs and voters following the Partygate row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d031792c83dc802f63bfe94970702ee5b15a8f3/0_285_4897_2937/master/4897.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1b16fc72842d0ac97fa1d42f8ad5e2b5","title":"bernie sanders democrats sinema manchin politics live latest","story":"The president is expected to field tough questions about Democrats’ failure to pass their voting rights bill and the Build Back Better Act, as well as his unimpressive approval rating. Speaking at her daily briefing yesterday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki instead stressed the accomplishments of Biden’s first year in office, including boosting coronavirus vaccination rates and getting the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law. “We need to build on that. The work is not done. The job is not done. And we are certainly not conveying it is,” Psaki said. “So, our objective -- and I think what you’ll hear the president talk about tomorrow -- is how to build on the foundation we laid in the first year.” The press conference is scheduled to begin at 4pm ET, and the blog will have updates and analysis once it starts. Stay tuned.The Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote on the bill later today, and it will almost certainly fail. Because of a Republican filibuster, the bill will need 60 votes to advance, which will not happen in the 50-50 Senate.Schumer sharply criticized Republicans for downplaying the impact of the voting restrictions enacted by 19 states in the past year. “Our Republican colleagues don’t even acknowledge that we have a crisis,” Schumer said, noting that minority leader Mitch McConnell claimed states were not engaged in voter suppression. Schumer outlined some of the restrictions that states have enacted, including limiting early voting and hours at polling places and making it harder to register to vote. “Just as Donald Trump has his ‘big lie,’ Leader McConnell now has his: ‘States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters whatsoever,’” Schumer said.“It is such an important issue that all of us have grave concerns about, and it’s worthy of the time we spend,” Manchin told CNN. “I would like to see us stay on the bill. There’s no use to try to bring this to finality by having a vote that’s going to fail tonight. Let’s just stay on it.” As of now, the Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote on whether to advance Democrats’ voting rights bill, which passed the House last week. That vote, which will need the support of 60 members because of the filibuster, is expected to fail. And as long as Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema continue to oppose rule changes, the bill has no path to passage in the Senate.The Arizona Republic reports that Kelly, who is up for reelection this year, supports a “talking filibuster” rule only for Democrats voting rights bill. “If campaign finance and voting rights reforms are blocked again this week, I will support the proposed changes to pass them with a majority vote,” Kelly said in a statement. “Protecting the vote-by-mail system used by a majority of Arizonans and getting dark money out of our elections is too important to let fall victim to Washington dysfunction.” A talking filibuster would still require 60 Senate votes to cut off debate on a proposal, but that debate would eventually come to an end anyway as the filibusters gave up the floor. Once they did so, the debated bill could be passed by a simple majority of 51 votes. Democrats have been discussing a talking filibuster rule as a potential compromise for those who do not support eliminating the filibuster all together. However, as of now, the talking filibuster proposal does not have the necessary support for approval because Joe Manchin has said he wants all rule changes to attract bipartisan support, and Republicans remain staunchly opposed to weakening the filibuster.The report, which examines the state of play of the ongoing decennial redistricting cycle, notes that Republicans are shielding their efforts to dismantle minority districts by arguing that the new lines are based on partisanship. While racial discrimination in redistricting is illegal, the US supreme court said in 2019 that discrimination based on partisanship was acceptable.  “This cycle is seeing unprecedented efforts to undermine the political power of Black, Latino, Asian, and Native communities through redistricting, especially in southern states that, for the first time in more than half a century, are no longer covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act,” the report says.  “Some of the most aggressive attacks on minority power are coming in the suburbs of southern states like Texas and Georgia. There, Republicans have surgically dismantled rapidly ersifying districts where communities of color have enjoyed increasing electoral success in recent years,” it adds. The report also notes that Republicans, who have complete control over the drawing of 187 of the US House’s 435 districts, are making districts much less competitive.  Donald Trump won 54 districts by 15 or more points in states where the GOP controls redistricting under old maps. Under the new plan, that number increases to 70. The redistricting cycle is still ongoing. New York, Tennessee, and Missouri are still among the states where lawmakers are drawing new maps.EMILY’s List, the progressive group that backs women candidates who support abortion rights, said it would withhold its endorsement from Sinema because of her stance on filibuster reform. “Our mission can only be realized when everyone has the freedom to have their voice heard safely and freely at the ballot box,” EMILY’s List president Laphonza Butler said in a statement released yesterday. Butler noted that her group has not contributed to or endorsed Sinema’s campaign since she first won her Senate seat in Arizona’s 2018 elections. “Electing Democratic pro-choice women is not possible without free and fair elections. Protecting the right to choose is not possible without access to the ballot box,” Butler said. “So, we want to make it clear: if Sen. Sinema can not support a path forward for the passage of this legislation, we believe she undermines the foundations of our democracy, her own path to victory and also the mission of EMILY’s List, and we will be unable to endorse her moving forward.”Progressive senator Bernie Sanders has said he may consider supporting primary challengers to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the two holdouts in Democrats’ debate over whether to amend the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. Sanders told reporters yesterday that he believes “there is a very good chance” the two senators will face primary challenges because of their stance on the filibuster. When asked if he would consider backing such primary challengers, Sanders replied, “Well, yeah.”  Manchin brushed off the warning, saying, “I’ve been primaried my entire life. That would not be anything new for me.” But Sanders’ comments underscore the growing rift in the Democratic party over the filibuster and, more broadly, the best response to Republican obstructionism. While progressives support using every tool at their disposal to circumvent Republican tactics, centrists like Manchin and Sinema still underscore the importance of bipartisanship, which has become increasingly rare in Washington. Joe Biden will hold a press conference later today, and he will almost certainly be asked what that ide says about his party and whether he can get anything else done in Congress with members of his own party at odds. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34a5d9626716bec4a20547f63c8473e37a057653/0_0_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1c60fcc85cc451ad87a3f86ad84282e0","title":"covid news live england expected to ease omicron restrictions who chief says pandemic is nowhere near over","story":"He said the government had taken a “different path” to much of Europe and the “data are showing that, time and again, this government got the toughest decisions right”. The restrictions, which include working from home advice, mandatory face masks in some settings and Covid passports, will be allowed to expire on 26 January. The news comes as Covid infection levels are falling in most parts of the UK for the first time since early December. From 27 January, the following changes will take effect in England: However, there will still be a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive for Covid.  But Johnson said there will “soon be a time” when self-isolation guidance can be removed entirely. The regulations expire on 24 March, he said, adding he does not expect to renew them. The south of the country is worse affected than the north and the crisis is raising concerns about standards of care and widespread rationing of services. A typical care home in London with 100 staff now has at least 12 vacancies.  That is compared to 94,432 infections and 438 fatalities reported in the 24 hours prior. It comes as Boris Johnson announced the end of all Covid measures introduced to combat the Omicron variant – including compulsory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, guidance to work from home and vaccine certificates – from next week. The prime minister told the Commons that the legal requirement on people with coronavirus to self-isolate would be allowed to lapse when the regulations expired on 24 March, and that date could be brought forward. You can read more about that here: All plan B Covid restrictions, including mask wearing, to end in England Local newspaper Il Gazzettino reported that the theatre and film actor, star of “Dangerous Liaisons” and “Being John Malkovich”, was in Venice for two days of filming for US television series “Ripley”. Because his mandatory vaccination card had expired, Malkovich was denied entry to his luxury suite at the Hotel Danieli overlooking the Grand Canal, the paper wrote. He was instead housed in private lodgings, it said. Contacted by phone, the hotel would not confirm reports due to privacy concerns. Italian news agency ANSA confirmed the report, citing sources within the production. Under Italian law, only those who show proof of full vaccination or recovery from Covid can access public spaces like hotels, restaurants, bars and other venues, as well as public transport.The interior minister Francisca Van Dunem told a news conference that quarantined voters should only head to polling stations from 6pm to 7pm, urging those not infected to go before that period. The recommendation is not mandatory. They must wear a face mask, keep a social distance and can only leave home to vote. Staff working at polling stations will be given protective equipment. “We need a social pact that allows everyone to vote in safety,” said Van Dunem, asking those in isolation not to take public transport to the polling station but walk or use their own vehicle instead. The head of health authority DGS, Graça Freitas, said there would be no designated areas for those with Covid-19 to vote in and they would not be required to show proof of their health status at the polls. “This solution of having a dedicated time period for these people to vote... will prevent, not totally, but will minimise the risk of contagion,” Freitas said. The election was called after parliament rejected the minority Socialist government’s budget bill for 2022. The prime minister António Costa’s party has a comfortable lead in opinion polls but is likely to fall short of a full parliamentary majority. The election campaign is in full swing after Sunday’s kick-off and street rallies draw large crowds, where mask-wearing is optional.Debbie Hicks, 47, a former teacher and psychologist, filmed twice at the Gloucestershire Royal hospital in Gloucester in December 2020 and told staff who challenged her she could do what she wanted as she paid her taxes. Hicks, from Stroud, argued that she was exercising her right to freedom of expression and trying to expose what she believed was a false government narrative that hospitals were full of patients with Covid. But finding her guilty of using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, the district judge Nicholas Wattam said staff had the right to work without being molested. Read the full story here: Covid denier fined for filming in Gloucester hospital The prime minister Petr Fiala said his new centre-right government did not see reasons for compulsory inoculation as the previous administration had planned in some sectors. “This does not change our stance on vaccination. It is still undoubtedly the best way to fight Covid-19 ... however, we do not want to deepen fissures in society,” Fiala told a news conference on Wednesday. In December, the previous government ordered Covid-19 vaccinations from March 2022 for hospital and nursing home staff, police, soldiers and some other professions, as well as those aged over 60. That decision brought protests against the measures. The policy turn comes as a wave of the Omicron variant hits the country of 10.7 million people. The health ministry said 28,469 new cases were reported for Tuesday, a record daily number since the start of the pandemic and more than double the 12,371 reported the same day last week. Like other central European nations, the government expects about 50,000 daily cases by the end of the month. In preparation, asymptomatic essential healthcare workers and social service personnel who test positive may be allowed to continue working. Businesses want the list extended. Fiala’s government has also shortened quarantine and isolation times, while launching mandatory testing of employees at companies from this week. Hospitalisations, which peaked in the latest Delta wave at more than 7,000 in early December, dropped to 1,635 on Tuesday from 1,761 reported for Monday. The country has reported 36,937 coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic, one of the world’s worst rates per capita.Since December, when tighter restrictions were introduced in an effort to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, the number of reported forgeries has soared, police said. In most public places in Germany the public now have to prove a 2G status - that they are double vaccinated or recovered - and more recently 2G +, which represents either an official lateral flow test result or a booster shot.  The measures do not apply to essential services such as medical practices, supermarkets and other grocery stores, whilst on public transport, 3G rules apply (according to which people have to prove they have been double vaccinated, have recovered or have a negative test result). The demand for forged vaccine passes has increased as rules have tightened, the federal police department told the news agency DPA.  Forgeries have been particularly high in the southern state of Bavaria, where 4000 cases are active, and the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where police are investigating more than 3500 cases. The government in Munich has said it believes the real number is likely to be considerably higher. Fake vaccines are also an issue in Germany, as highlighted following raids last week carried out at 100 addresses across four states, after it was discovered that a doctor in Bavaria had administered placebo vaccines - consisting of a saline solution - to his patients.  Vaccine sceptics from across the country reportedly travelled to his practice to receive the jabs and the accompanying vaccine certificate. Among the jabbed were also people who had thought they had received a genuine vaccine, discovering only through an antibody test offered by the local health authorities that that was not the case.  The doctor has been temporarily suspended by medical authorities, pending a criminal investigation. One of the people who unwittingly received the placebo vaccine, a 50-year-old woman who lives with her 85-year old mother, told the tabloid newspaper Bild: “I was flabbergasted when I found out. I wanted BioNTech, but I got saline solution instead.”  She said the doctor had inoculated her in her right buttock, stating at the same time: “Be careful - winter’s coming”.Some accused ministers of “sending the wrong signal to the public” for political expediency, and said it was “very premature” to conclude the threat from Omicron had subsided.  Hospitals in some areas have also not yet hit predicted peak Covid admission levels, NHS leaders said. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospital, mental health, community and ambulance services, said:  Cordery said it was “important” to recognise “that this surge isn’t over” and that “the health service is still operating under extremely challenging circumstances”.  Pat Cullen, the Royal College of Nursing’s general secretary and chief executive, said:  Cullen said the country could not rely on vaccines alone when the situation is “still so precariously balanced”.  Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said:  The government is due to publish figures for Covid-related absence in schools next week. “The danger is we lift restrictions too quickly before the effects of returning to school are clear,” said Bousted.  There was also scepticism that the Covid announcements may have been politically motivated to distract from the prime minister’s predicament. “Rather than announcements aimed at saving Boris Johnson’s job, government should be exercising a duty of care to the nation’s pupils and the staff who educate them,” said Bousted. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the prime minister’s decision to lift Plan B measures is at odds with the situation school leaders are facing on the ground. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, gave a conditional welcome to the announcement on masks, as long as it is supported by public health and scientific advice. He said the situation in schools and colleges remains extremely challenging with significant levels of pupil and staff absence due to Covid as well as difficulties in obtaining supply cover because of high demand. The Department for Education later clarified that masks will no longer need to be worn in classrooms from Thursday, but will continue to be worn in communal areas in schools in England until Thursday next week when masks will go altogether.Covid infections are falling across most parts of the UK, according to the latest official data which suggest that the winter wave driven by the Omicron variant has passed its peak. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that infections in the community fell in England, Wales and Scotland in the week ending 15 January, with the trend in Northern Ireland still uncertain. The figures mark a turning point in the latest phase of the epidemic which has seen weeks of record-breaking infections in the UK fuelled by Omicron. While infection levels are still high, the ONS estimates that they fell in England from 3,735,000 in the first week of January, with 1 in 15 people testing positive, to 2,984,200 or 1 in 20 testing positive last week. Similar declines were seen in Wales and Scotland where the ONS estimates that 1 in 25 and 1 in 20 people, respectively, had the virus in the week ending 15 January. Infections may be approaching a peak in Northern Ireland too, where a further 1 in 20 were estimated to have the virus last week.  The interim data from the ONS, which will be followed by a full report on Friday, show Covid infections declined in all regions of England in the most recent week, except the North East and the South West where it was unclear whether cases had peaked for now.  While infections decreased in most age groups in England in the latest week of the survey, they rose in young children aged two years old to year six of primary school. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the ONS Covid-19 infection survey said the latest figures showed “a welcome decrease in infections across most parts of the UK and among all age groups apart from younger children.”He said the government had taken a “different path” to much of Europe and the “data are showing that, time and again, this government got the toughest decisions right”. The restrictions, which include working from home advice, mandatory face masks in some settings and Covid passports, will be allowed to expire on 26 January.

Josephs led the government’s Covid-19 taskforce from July to December 2020. After details of the gathering emerged in the media she released a statement admitting it took place and saying she was “truly sorry”. Sheffield city council, her current employer, said a committee of councillors would be set up “to consider what steps, if any, should be taken next”. Josephs’ leaving drinks gathering was attended by dozens of officials from the Cabinet Office’s Covid-19 taskforce. On the day it was held the government’s official Twitter feed replied to a query asking if employers could hold Christmas parties at the end of the working day. The feed said: “Hi Mick, although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” The full story is here: Sheffield council to decide fate of chief Kate Josephs following lockdown drinks "},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Some \u0026lsquodramatised\u0026rsquo shots in the BBC\u0026rsquos The Snow Wolf were implausibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"full text of the speech taoiseach brian cowen","story":"Full text of the speech given by the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, at the Annual Wolfe Tone Commemoration, Bodenstown, Co.

Is iad a chuir na síolta as ar fhás poblachtánas nua-aimseartha Éireannach agus bhí páirt uasal acu ar an gcosán i dtreo saoirse na hÉireann.D’fhógair Pádraig Mac Piarais go raibh Wolfe Tone ar dhuine de na hÉireannaigh ab fhearr ariamh. Spreag sé muintir a linne féin gan cuimhne Tone a ligean i ndearmad. Mheas sé freisin go raibh an láthair seo,Baile Uí Bhuadáin, ar an bhfód is naofa sa tír. Táimid cruinnithe anseo inniu, lenár linn féin, agus meas againn ar shaothar Wolfe Tone ar son na hÉireann, ach ní meabhrú ar an aimsir chaite amháin atá ar bun againn. Tiomnaímid sinn féin in athuair do na prionsabail ar íobair Tone a shaol féin ar a son — saoirse, comhionannas agus bráithreachas.On this very date, 12th October, in 1798, Wolfe Tone was taken prisoner by His Majesty’s Forces following the defeat of the French navy in a crucial battle off the Buncrana coast. The historian, Marianne Elliot records: “A severe storm broke just as the French neared the northern Irish coast. Too heavily laden for easy manoeuvrability and already damaged by the voyage, they were chased by Sir John Borlase Warren and forced to join battle at dawn on 12th October.Wolfe Tone had an essential nobility. His son, William, who served as an officer in the Napoleonic Army, wrote a biography of his father’s life in which he recorded how Wolfe Tone had eschewed all pleas to desert his men and his doomed ship.“At that moment, a boat came from the Biche for his last orders. That ship had the best chance to get off. The French officers all supplicated my father to embark on board of her. ‘Our contest is hopeless’, they observed, ‘we will be prisoners of war, but what will become of you?’ ‘Shall it be said,‘ replied he, ‘that I fled, while the French were fighting the battles of my country?’”That battle on 12th October 1798 was not the first time that Wolfe Tone had attempted to liberate our country with the support of his European allies. In advance of the ill-fated Bantry Bay expedition, two years previously, Wolfe Tone had drafted ‘An Address to the People of Ireland.‘ It read: “Ireland shall be independent. We shall be a nation not a province, citizens not slaves. Every man shall rank in the State according to his merit and his talents. Our commerce shall extend into the four quarters of the globe our flag shall be seen on the ocean our name shall be known among the nations, and we shall at length assume that station for which God and Nature have designed us’.In those words lies the genesis of the honourable tradition of Irish republicanism. For Tone, and for us, Irish republicanism is a progressive force with an unwavering focus on the goal of an Ireland where all our people can excel. It is about building an island free of “all past dissensions.” It is about fostering a new ethos of fraternity on this island regardless of people’s origin, class or religion. It is also about our country proudly taking its place among the nations, not standing separate from them.We should never forget that Tone, and his disciple, Robert Emmet were true internationalists in their day. Tone’s court-martial address cites the heroic failure of the Polish uprising against Imperial Russia. The United Irishmen were strongly influenced by the fledgling democracy in the United States and by revolutionary France. Their spiritual heirs in the Young Ireland movement would subsequently adopt our national tricolour in honour of the 1848 Rising in Paris.In every generation, those who carried the flame for Irish democracy and freedom were never insular in their approach.We advance our interests not by going solo, but by working with like-minded others on problems, challenges and opportunities that can best, indeed can only, be responded to by working across national borders and boundaries. It is in this way that our membership of the European Union, in particular, will best serve the interests of Ireland and the Irish people in the decades ahead.Personally, I firmly believe that, to be most effective, Ireland needs to continue to be right at the heart of Europe. The EU’s capacity to accommodate different traditions, cultures and priorities does not uniquely apply to Ireland. It would not be in our interests to place ourselves in a position where other member states view us as obstructing the progress that others wish to see for themselves, without properly assessing what the consequences for us might be.Over the coming weeks, I envisage a comprehensive, rational and intelligent debate on the issues of concern that were raised in the Referendum. We need to assess where we go from here and we need to engage with our EU partners on how they would be prepared to allay those concerns. We need to have the maturity to accept that pooling our sovereignty with others is not the same as giving it away. The Irish nation should not turn inwards. To prosper economically and socially, we must look further afield. The single European market has been hugely important for the growth of Irish business and the creation of literally hundreds of thousands of jobs. Ireland has prospered through this engagement and, in more difficult times, it is imperative we do not turn back.We are already embarked on a review of the most important concerns that emerged through the Referendum. I will lead the engagement with our EU partners about the more substantive concerns that arose then. Many who registered a No vote support the EU project, some of them strongly so. I’ve already acknowledged that there were failures of communication which contributed to a reticence, by some, to support the Treaty.My job as Taoiseach is to balance those interests in attempting to resolve the dilemma that our No vote poses, not just for Europe, but for Ireland within Europe and in the wider modern world.In the present global financial turmoil, membership of the Eurozone, has provided Ireland with significant advantages. At the outset, the European Central Bank was ready and able to assist banks who were experiencing problems in accessing credit.The ECB has continued to play a vital role in the provision of credit to banks in the Eurozone. Through its various actions, including recent coordinated interest rate reductions, the ECB, and by extension our own Central Bank, is continuing to support banks in counteracting the financial turmoil.The tradition which Wolfe Tone and his contemporaries initiated moved us from nationalism to a much broader republicanism where the State is not an end in itself but a means of promoting the welfare of its people.This republicanism continues to have a vital contemporary relevance particularly in relation to how it stresses long-term solutions even where these require short-term sacrifice. It is in this context that I would like to make a few comments about what is the greatest economic crisis to face the world in over a generation. Many of the causes are rooted in how the international financial system operates and are difficult to understand. But, unfortunately, the ultimate impact can be very real for ordinary people.When confronted with economic, financial and budgetary pressures of the scale and pace of those being seen at the moment, there is an immediate challenge placed before everyone in public life. The prevailing question is — will we act for the long-term even where this requires tough and unpopular measures? Or will we take the soft option of focusing merely on the short-term and thereby avoid hard decisions in the hope that problems will simply disappear?I don’t believe that the Irish people would want us to shy away from the difficult decisions we must now make. We will make the necessary tough choices so that we can chart a course for economic renewal to bring us beyond the current short-term difficulties towards a stable long-term growth rate.History shows that the only way to deliver long-term economic and social improvements is to do whatever is required to ensure economic and fiscal stability. This goes right to the core of the actions we have taken recently and those that we will take in the Budget and in the months ahead. Our priority is to firstly stabilise the situation and then chart a pathway to recovery in the years ahead.At his court martial, Wolfe Tone expressed his abhorrence at how his plans for military separation had spiraled into a cycle of vicious atrocities on both sides. In our generation, we too have seen the devastation caused by violence and the pain and ision it leaves in its wake. Two hundred and ten years on from Wolfe Tone’s death, we are privileged to gather today at a time of peace.Recently, the Independent Monitoring Commission confirmed that the IRA Army Council is neither functional nor operational. This opens the way for the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland.Difficulties do remain. The wounds and suspicions of decades and centuries cannot be healed overnight.But these difficulties can — and I believe will — be overcome.The historical significance of Unionist and Nationalist Ministers working side by side in the Executive is immense. By showing common cause in working together for the welfare of all of Northern Ireland’s people, they are giving practical expression to the ideal expressed by Tone of uniting Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter.Fianna Fáil in Government is proud to work as partners in this island with the Northern Ireland Executive. As Taoiseach, I will continue to work constructively with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, and the other members of the Executive in promoting a better future for all of the people of Northern Ireland and of this island.Our former leader, Bertie Ahern TD, was the joint architect of the Good Friday Agreement. His persistence, his skills and his commitment ensured that the Agreement was implemented and built upon.It was fitting that it was he who welcomed Dr Ian Paisley to Dublin last year and to the site of the Battle of the Boyne.It was fitting that he became the first Taoiseach to address the British Houses of Parliament in Westminster, where he laid to rest the ghosts of past ision between our two countries.It was entirely fitting too, as the first Fianna Fáil Taoiseach to address the United States Congress, he was able to say to our friends in America and across the world: “Ireland is at peace”.We thank Bertie Ahern for all of the work, effort and political acumen he brought to bear on the peace process. He deserves great credit for all the achievements during his term in office as Party Leader and Taoiseach, and his fellow countrymen and women will always hold him in high esteem for that enduring work on the peace process.It is our duty now to build on that peace.The institutions established by the people of this island in 1998 are held in sacred trust by us all, and for us all. They are not the property of one tradition, one party or even one generation.It is the duty and responsibility of all those who are elected by the people, North and South, to abide by agreements in good faith and to operate all of the institutions entrusted to their care by the people.The Government I lead will shoulder its responsibilities.Ten years on, we will continue to build on the legacy of 1998.We will protect and nurture the inheritance of the Irish people.We will continue to lead — for peace, for reconciliation, for prosperity and for a better future for everyone, from all traditions, on this island.We will build that island free of past dissensions, proud of our independence, proud of our membership of the European Union and proud of our close links across the world.That is how we honour Theobald Wolfe Tone — by making his dreams for our country come true."},{"url":null,"title":"nocebo effect two thirds of covid jab reactions not caused by vaccine study claims","story":"A nurse prepares a dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Photgraph: Pedro PardoAFP via Getty ImagesMore than two-thirds of the common side-effects people experience after a Covid jab can be attributed to a negative version of the placebo effect rather than the vaccine itself, researchers claim.Scientists in the US examined data from 12 clinical trials of Covid vaccines and found that the “nocebo effect” accounted for about 76 per cent of all common adverse reactions after the first dose and nearly 52 per cent after the second dose.The findings suggest that a substantial proportion of milder side-effects, such as headaches, short-term fatigue, and arm pain are not produced by the constituents of the vaccine, but by other factors thought to generate the nocebo response, including anxiety, expectation and misattributing various ailments to having had the jab.In view of their results, the researchers argue that better public information about nocebo responses may improve Covid vaccine uptake by reducing the concerns that make some people hesitant.“Telling patients that the intervention they are taking has side-effects that are similar to placebo treatments for the condition in randomised controlled trials actually reduces anxiety and makes patients take a moment to consider the side-effect,” said Ted Kaptchuk, professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard medical school, and a senior author on the study. “But we need more research.”Prof Kaptchuck and Dr Julia Haas at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston analysed adverse events reported during a dozen clinical trials of Covid vaccines. In each trial, those in the placebo arm were given injections of inactive salt solution instead of vaccine. The study did not look at severe, rare side-effects such as blood clots or heart inflammation.Writing in the journal Jama Network Open, the researchers describe how after the first injection more than 35 per cent of those in the placebo groups experienced so-called “systemic” side-effects, such as headache and fatigue, with 16 per cent reporting site-specific ailments including arm pain or redness or swelling at the injection site.As expected, those who received a first shot of vaccine were more likely to experience side-effects. About 46 per cent reported systemic symptoms and two-thirds experienced arm pain or other localised symptoms at the injection site.When the researchers looked at side-effects after the second vaccine, they found the rate of headaches or other systemic symptoms was nearly twice as high in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group, at 61 per cent and 32 per cent respectively. The difference was even greater for local ailments, reaching 73 per cent among those who had the vaccine and 12 per cent in the placebo group.Overall, the researchers calculate that about two-thirds of common side-effects reported in Covid vaccine trials are driven by the nocebo effect, in particular headaches and fatigue, which many Covid vaccine leaflets list as the most common adverse reactions after a shot.While evidence suggests that information about side-effects can cause people to misattribute common ailments to the vaccine, or make people hyper-alert to how they are feeling, Kaptchuk argues for more information about side-effects, not less. “Most researchers argue that patients should be told less about side-effects to reduce their anxiety,” he said. “I think this is wrong. Honesty is the way to go.”–  News and Media Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto jackpot winner told to get financial advice before collecting cheque","story":"A record-breaking €19 million National Lottery ticket which won last Saturday’s draw was sold at Laura Scriney\u0027s newsagents shop in Castlebar.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdShop owner Laura Scriney celebrates outside her Laura’s XL store with family and staff after selling Saturday’s €19.06 million Lotto jackpot ticket. Photograph: Mac Innes PhotographyThe burning question – who matched six numbers in Saturday’s “must be won” €19.06 million Lotto jackpot draw – still remains tantalisingly unanswered.That principal character was glaringly absent, but much talked about, on Wednesday when Lotto representatives brought champagne and helium-filled balloons to Castlebar, Co Mayo, to celebrate with winning shop owner Laura Scriney.National Lottery press officer Fran Whearty gave nothing away in response to media questions, except that the winning quick pick was purchased on Saturday and that the winner had been in touch with National Lottery HQ.“We advised the ticket holder to go away and get some legal and financial advice before collecting their cheque,” Mr Whearty explained.Ms Scriney reflected to reporters on a “bittersweet” week in which she lost a beloved grandmother and afterwards sold the elusive €19 million jackpot ticket.“Recent days have been such a mixture of emotions,” she said. “On this day last week, Granny Scriney (95) was in the funeral home. Today it’s a totally different story.”Ms Scriney says she “hasn’t a clue” as to the identity of the winner.It is possible but no certainty that a local Castlebar person or syndicate won the jackpot. “We get customers from all over as Castlebar is such a popular shopping town. The winner could be from Bangor Erris, Claremorris or Ballinrobe, anywhere,” she says.Significant luck“I have my regulars but there’s plenty coming from farther afield. Whoever won, I wish them the best of luck.”Ms Scriney, who opened her store near Castlebar Town Centre in September 2019, has enjoyed significant luck Lotto-wise.Two months after she opened, a customer won a sizeable amount on Winning Streak. Last July, the shop sold a winning Telly Bingo ticket worth €60,000.Ms Scriney stands personally to gain €15,000, the prize for the winning store.Being officially named as the retailer who had sold the winning ticket came as a huge shock, she says.“There were so many rumours going around town that it could be this retailer or that retailer. Never once did I think it was going to be me.“I got an awful shock when I saw two National Lottery representatives on my doorstep last evening as I was closing, informing me I was the winning retailer.”Saturday’s jackpot win by a person who matched six numbers came after more than 60 draws over seven months. Saturday was the first “must be won” National Lottery draw which if no one had matched six numbers could have seen the prize shared among those who matched five numbers and a bonus number, or, if still no winners, those who matched five numbers.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ryan says easing of restrictions could happen from next week","story":"A phased lifting of restrictions is expected, with a return to normal hospitality trading hours and an increase in the number of people allowed at weddings and indoor and outdoor events first on the agenda. Photograph: Alan BetsonGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan has said he thinks it will be towards the end of next week when Covid-19 restrictions begin to ease, as Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said it is too early to say if an annual vaccine would be required.Mr Ryan cautioned that the severity of the Omicron variant should not be downplayed as there were 910 Covid patients in hospital on Wednesday, with 90 of those in ICU. Mr Ryan said Ministers were likely to meet this Friday to consider anticipated updated advice from Nphet, but said this Cabinet meeting may be scheduled for next Tuesday.This would give the public a few days’ advance notice in relation to the changes, he said on Wednesday. “Towards the end of next week I expect that we will start to see the restrictions start to be lifted,” said Mr Ryan.Mr Ryan, who is Minister for Transport as well as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, said he was keen to see a return to social life.He told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland cultural and artistic activities and attendance at sporting events was important, as was a return to working in offices.Mr Varadkar said that he hoped within a few months the State may be able to treat this virus as we treat other respiratory viruses.He said he did not agree with any rules that would require employees to show their vaccine status.“I would be reluctant to ask employers to ask employees about their vaccine status. Why would they not ask their staff about other vaccines (in that instance)?“There might be a case with regard to exceptional cases where people are working with immune-compromised people,” he said. Mr Donnelly said the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) was currently evaluating the merit of a fourth dose of vaccine for vulnerable groups, drawing on evidence from Israel and elsewhere.He said it was too early to tell if an annual vaccine would be required. “There are vaccines in development which provide longer immunity. Current vaccines do wane and we have seen the profile of that waning,” he said.Asked what he would have done if the gathering in the Department of Foreign Affairs two years ago had taken place in his own department, Mr Donnelly said Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had done “exactly the right thing” in ordering the review.He would not be drawn on what he would do in similar circumstances saying it would not “be fair or reasonable for me to speculate without getting the facts”. End of restrictionsMeanwhile, the Labour Party leader Alan Kelly has called for an immediate end to the restrictions on hospitality, saying he did not see the point in waiting any longer. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Mr Kelly called for any easing of Covid restrictions to be introduced immediately, if the chief medical officer Tony Holohan gives his approval.Mr Kelly was reacting to comments made by Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, who said that it could be a week before restrictions were eased to give notice to businesses.Mr Kelly said businesses should not have to “lose out” on another week, and there could be another shutdown later in the year so that week could be important to a business.Mr Kelly also called for measures to ensure outdoor events go ahead. He urged a return to indoor-seated events along the lines of requirements last October.Government sources have said they expect some restrictions to be relaxed from next week.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Tuesday evening told a Fine Gael party parliamentary meeting that he hoped March 31st would signal the end of most restrictions. It is expected that the lifting of restrictions will be phased, and a return to normal hospitality trading hours and an increase in the number of people allowed at weddings and indoor and outdoor events will be first on the agenda.Nightclubs will open after that.Meanwhile, a further six people who previously tested positive recently for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland have died, the North’s Department of Health said on Wednesday. Another 4,451 confirmed cases of the virus were also recorded in the North in its latest 24-hour reporting period.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe About three-quarters of the homes to be delivered by the Land Development Agency (LDA) are expected to be cost rental, according to the organisation’s new chairman. New chairman Cormac O’Rourke will also outline LDA plans for more than 10,000 new homes to be provided in the short to medium term when he appears before the Oireachtas committee on housing on Thursday. The Government’s Housing for All plan to tackle the housing crisis aims to deliver 18,000 cost-rental homes by 2030. The cost-rental model involves rates of rent that cover the cost of constructing and maintaining the homes.The intention is for the tenants’ rent payments to be at least 25 per cent below market value. Cost rental is aimed at people who don’t qualify for social housing but cannot afford rent in the private market. Under Housing for All, the LDA will be the State’s primary channel for the development of cost-rental housing. It will also deliver affordable purchase and social housing.The LDA had been established on an interim basis in 2018 to amass and develop State property for housing but it became a statutory body only in July last when new laws took force.LDA chairman designate Mr O’Rourke is to tell the committee that the agency’s “working assumption is that cost rental will account for approximately 75 per cent of homes built” as a result of its work. His opening statement to the committee will say that this is “subject to future discussions with the local authorities and Government on the housing needs in different areas”.Mr O’Rourke will detail short-term plans, saying the LDA’s main focus in the coming year will be on delivery.He says construction at two key sites, Shanganagh, Co Dublin, and St Kevin’s in Cork, will start this year, “but will take some time to complete”.Project TosaighThe LDA is also involved in Housing for All’s Project Tosaigh – an initiative to activate land with planning permission that is not currently going to construction or is not being delivered quickly enough. The proposal is to accelerate the provision of public housing – both cost rental and affordable purchase – on such private land through forward purchase. His statement says the ambition is to deliver 5,000 homes through Project Tosaigh over the next four years. On medium-term plans, Mr O’Rourke says that approximately 5,200 more homes are to be delivered on 10 State-owned sites, including St Teresa’s Gardens and the Central Mental Hospital site in Dublin as well as Shanganagh and St Kevin’s. He says these plans are subject to planning and Government approval and the expected mix of housing to be delivered on the sites is approximately 80 per cent apartments and 20 per cent houses. Other sites to follow the initial 10 have also been identified. Mr O’Rourke will say that “the issue of poor productivity arises in the construction of housing from the fact that builders continue to execute a traditional site-based approach”. He will say that “the LDA will look to encourage standardisation and modular construction – to speed up construction, improve quality, provide better working conditions for workers, and generate houses that are more sustainable at lower cost”.Mr O’Rourke will outline his career with the ESB, KBC Bank, ESB International and Goodbody Corporate Finance, as well as his time as chairman of Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in his first meeting with the committee"},{"url":null,"title":"political horizon what are the main issues for this year","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin is set to hand over the political reins to Leo Varadkar at the end of 2022. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAs the Dáil returns on Wednesday after its Christmas recess, the Covid-19 pandemic is not the only issue on the agenda. Here are five political questions for 2022: What happens with the changeover of taoiseach?For the first time in the State’s history, the office of taoiseach is due to be rotated later this year between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. On December 15th, Micheál Martin is due to hand over the reins to Leo Varadkar, who will then propose his government – at least, that’s the plan. Complicating matters is the Garda investigation into the leaking of a confidential GP contract by Varadkar to his friend Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail. Many in Fine Gael are anxious about the fact that the investigation is ongoing, even if few expect it to end in a criminal prosecution. Then there is the not-insignificant issue of Martin’s leadership of Fianna Fáil. Even before the start of his term as taoiseach there were whisperings in the party of unhappiness with his leadership and talk of a potential heave. Could this be the year that this simmering tension finally comes to boil? It seems unlikely for the moment, but nothing is certain in politics.Who might lose out in the reshuffle that ensues?Sources who attended a Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting before Christmas said that Varadkar delivered a thinly veiled threat: pull up your socks, or else, because changes are coming. But who would Varadkar drop from his own stable? Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has had an uneasy time in recent months between the abandoned appointment of Katherine Zappone as special envoy and the champagne party that officials in his department held when Ireland won a seat on the UN Security Council. However, few believe that Varadkar would drop Coveney and his understanding and experience around Brexit, when the issue is still looming at the top of the agenda in Ireland, the UK and the EU.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee is increasingly seen as a potential Fine Gael leadership contender, but she has been a steady hand in her role and is understood to have Varadkar’s confidence and support. Then there is Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris, who is another sure-fire leadership candidate. He won praise for his time in the Department of Health during the fraught early stages of the pandemic and is one of the best communicators the Government has. Dropping him from the Cabinet would surely give him that bit of extra time to mull over potential future plans. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys has taken charge of the various pandemic welfare schemes and then took on McEntee’s portfolio when she took maternity leave. Those who worked with her during this time say she handled the workload ably. This leaves Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. It is an unwritten rule that the same party should not hold the taoiseach’s office and finance ministry in a coalition government, so he is likely to move out of this portfolio but almost certainly into another.Whatever way it is viewed, any major changes would mean a high-profile demotion and rocky waters are the last thing Varadkar needs at the start of his premiership – Martin learned this the hard way during his first few weeks at the helm. As for the Fianna Fáil Ministers, it will be interesting to see who has the health and housing jobs when Christmas comes around.Will Covid-19 lose its grip?The full-blown anxiety about the Omicron variant over the Christmas has given way to a cautious, but growing, optimism. Only a fool would predict the end of Covid-19 will come this year, but the great hope is that it moves from pandemic to endemic status. There is much working in our favour. First, with hundreds of thousands potentially contracting the disease every week, according to estimates from public health, a significant degree of natural immunity must be building up. Ireland also has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. And the current strain is evidently less severe than those that have come before. A number of anti-viral drugs may become available this year, and the expectation is that vaccines can be tweaked in future. Some of the major pandemic business support schemes are due to expire this spring and it looks as though many of the remaining partial restrictions will be lifted next month. If the pandemic recedes, we will see more “politics as usual” and hear more about things like the housing crisis, health waiting lists and the increasing cost of living. Sinn Féin will attempt to capitalise on its position in the polls and will up the ante on the big-ticket items as they move closer to what could be the most important election for the party in a long time.Will the Ceta deal pass without any political casualties?Varadkar has said that any failure to ratify the EU-Canada trade deal (Ceta) would be an “own goal” for Ireland and would send out the “wrong message”. But it could have far greater ramifications beyond messaging. The High Court last September dismissed a challenge by Green Party TD Patrick Costello over the constitutionality of aspects of the deal. But it is known that there is ongoing tension over the deal among Green Party members, with critics saying the investorcourt dispute system remains problematic.In a recent interview with RTÉ, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said there would be consequences for any party TD who did not vote in line with any Government plan to ratify the deal this year. A date for such a vote has not yet been set, but it will put the focus back onto the role of the Greens in government.Will the abortion law change?One of the biggest social changes in recent years came about after the landslide referendum result in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment in 2018. Abortion then became available up to 12 weeks’ gestation in January 2019. Beyond that, terminations are legal in cases where there is a risk to the life or health of the woman, or where there is a diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality. Under the legislation passed by the Oireachtas, a review of the operation of the law must be initiated within three years. A public consultation is under way and an independent chairperson to lead the review will likely be in place by the end of January. The chair will submit a review and recommendations to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in the summer or autumn, and these will then be brought to the Cabinet.

Photograph: Richard BakerIn Pictures via Getty ImagesYes, he might lose his job, US-resident Brits are currently having to explain to neighbours, friends and Uber drivers. Yes, the prime minister of the actual UK. Yes, over some office parties of less than Caligula-grade decadence.The bemusement of our hosts is not evidence of their slacker ethical standards. Rather, the problem is that Americans tend to underrate how harsh the UK’s lockdown was for much of 2020 – and how correspondingly provocative Boris Johnson’s breaches of it are.In turn, both countries struggle to believe the severity of the restrictions under which Australians have lived. A bid for “Covid zero” made the place all but unvisitable at times, even for passport-holding expats. Melbourne had no fewer than six lockdowns. Unable to renew his near-monopoly on that city’s Grand Slam tennis tournament, Novak Djokovic can attest to the strength of feeling there.All of which gives rise to a question. If there is such a thing as an “Anglosphere”, bound by a deep-seated culture of inidualism, why did the member nations erge so much over the pandemic? Aukus, a naval pact agreed between the three countries mentioned above last September, breathed new life into the idea of English-speaking unity.But the past two years have more often argued against it. The gamut of pandemic measures runs from the relative laxity of the US to, in the case of Australasia, perhaps the severest lockdowns in the western world. Some local authorities in Britain were taping up park benches to prevent strangers sharing them. Try doing that in Dallas or Miami. To the extent that Covid has served as an audit of national cultures, the findings refute the idea of a Washington-to-Wellington communion of values.For the US, with a $21 trillion economy and no express need for the outside world, this is an academic point. But for a midsized nation that has spurned its own continental market, on the hunch that its English-speaking former colonies can step in, the tenuousness of any Anglosphere is more troubling. It implies that national interests still trump (for want of a less loaded verb) ancestral fealties.Steel tariffsTellingly, the US still has steel tariffs on the UK, but not on the EU. Washington’s trade representative Katherine Tai is “confident that we will take this up when the time is right”. It is not known whether she was ruffling Johnson’s hair and praising the quaintness of Regency costume dramas while uttering those words.I spent long enough in Westminster to anticipate the Conservative response here. That is, a Republican administration would have been more generous to the UK. And so we have the paradox of the “special relationship”: it is at once fundamental and entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House.If any good comes of the past two years, it will be a sense of realism in Britain and elsewhere about the US. It is not, as even the French presume, an “Anglo-Saxon” country, whatever that means. It does not share political culture or institutions with the white Commonwealth. First, it broke from colonial rule much earlier and more absolutely than Australia, Canada or New Zealand, none of which are republics. Second, it absorbed such vast and such varied immigration as to become its own category of nation.Whether the events of 1776 constitute a “revolution” (Gore Vidal, noting that the domestic social order was not turned upside down, preferred the term “separation”), they ingrained a mistrust of the state. The consequences are evident in good ways and bad.“A Latin-Slav mixture”, one UK premier called America, and that was in the 1950s. In other words, even if you are a crude ethnic determinist, it makes no sense to assume an automatic coincidence of world views between the US and other countries that happen to speak English. It makes even less to bet your nation’s economic future on it. And given that the US accounts for the lion’s share of the population and economic output of the Anglosphere, that putative grouping has no meaning without it.AmbivalenceThe uniqueness of the US is recorded here with due ambivalence. On the one side, American inidualism prevented the most heavy-handed pandemic measures. It is increasingly plausible that the taped-up benches and Zoom-only funerals had a scarring effect that Britain and other nations will be reckoning with for years.On the other side, there is a pandemic death toll that now well exceeds that of the American Civil War. Either way, as Anglosphere enthusiasts struggle to accept, the US is different. It is not an overgrown Britain. Those who fawn over it most, understand it least. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"economic storm clouds gathering","story":"Amid his many travails, Boris Johnson must hope that a few more days will see the “partygate” furore subside, assuming the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray provides the wriggle room to escape. But it will be but a temporary reprieve before the economic storm clouds start to gather in the spring.Arguably, they are already here. An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that, for the third time since the financial crash of 2008, real wages are falling once more and began to do so way back in June.With inflation expected to hit 6 per cent as taxes go up and energy bills double, the painful impact on household budgets is easy to foresee. Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election. As yet there is little sign of it.More from NewsNo more face masks in classrooms and other school rule changes after Plan B restrictions liftedFrench actor Gaspard Ulliel dies at 37 after ski accidentCovid latest news: No more masks and back to the office as Plan B restrictions droppedBoris Johnson latest news: David Davis tells PM \u0026#39in the name of God, go\u0026#39Nazi sympathiser jailed as judge quashes lenient book-reading punishmentWhat are the Covid Plan B restrictions and when will they end?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"father jihadi brighton family convicted encouraging islamist","story":"The father of a jihadi Brighton family has been found guilty of encouraging Islamist violence in a speech at his local mosque.Abubaker Deghayes, 53, promoted jihad by sword when he addressed worshippers at the Brighton Mosque and Muslim Community Centre.The defendant, who originally comes from Libya, had denied intending to encourage terrorism in his speech to around 50 people, including children and young adults.On Wednesday, a jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty of the charge.It can now be reported that two of Deghayes\u0027 sons were killed fighting for Islamists in Syria and he lost a third in a stabbing in the East Sussex city.Abdul - who had become embroiled with drugs and was murdered by a dealer in 2019 aged 22 - was the twin brother of Abdullah, who was killed fighting in Syria in 2016 aged 18.Their brother Jaffar, 17, was killed in 2014 while trying to overthrow Bashar Al-Assad\u0027s government fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra - an al-Qaeda-affiliated group.Amer, another son and former finance student, who also travelled to Syria, is understood to be continuing to fight in the Middle East.During his Old Bailey trial, jurors were played a video of Deghayes\u0027 speech at the mosque on Sunday November 1 2020.In it, he was seen to make a stabbing gesture when talking about jihad.He told worshippers: Whose power is more powerful than us? Allah is more powerful than you. You, idiots. You kuffar (non-believers)... The non-believer is an idiot. He\u0027s stupid.He went on: Jihad, jihad, jihad. Jihad is compulsory. Jihad is fighting by sword. That means this jihad is compulsory upon you, not jihad is the word of mouth but jihad will remain compulsory until the Day of Resurrection...Prosecutor Ben Lloyd told jurors that the speech was not given innocently or naively.He said: The prosecution case is clear. By the defendant\u0027s words and gestures he was encouraging people to undertake violent jihad.The defendant\u0027s speech demonstrates him to be an Islamic extremist. He is someone who believes in the use of violence in the cause of Islam.Or, at the very least, he was reckless in giving his speech as to whether people would be encouraged.The defendant, of Saltdean in East Sussex, denied wrongdoing, saying he was explaining the meaning of Jihad by the sword as self-defence.The gesture he made was a dance of the blade, he claimed.He also referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as wearing a face covering now after describing Muslim women as letter boxes.The jury was told nothing about the Deghayes family background.In 2017, a serious case review identified missed opportunities to prevent Deghayes\u0027 sons from being radicalised before they were killed in Syria.There was also little understanding of the part religion played in the lives of Abdullah and Jaffar, who were believed to have been with the al Qaida-affiliated Al-Nusra Front when they died, the review added.The report also contained allegations that their father would wake his children up at 4.30am to study the Koran and would whip them with electrical wire or hand out other punishments if he felt they were not doing this properly.After the review, their uncle Omar Deghayes - who was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and spent five years in Guantanamo Bay - hit out at police, claiming they took no action whatsoever while his radicalised young nephews were being racially abused.Following Deghayes\u0027 conviction, he was granted continued bail ahead of sentencing at the Old Bailey on February 25.More from NewsNo more face masks in classrooms and other school rule changes after Plan B restrictions liftedFrench actor Gaspard Ulliel dies at 37 after ski accidentCovid latest news: No more masks and back to the office as Plan B restrictions droppedBoris Johnson latest news: David Davis tells PM \u0026#39in the name of God, go\u0026#39Nazi sympathiser jailed as judge quashes lenient book-reading punishmentWhat are the Covid Plan B restrictions and when will they end?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab accidentally admits party","story":"Dominic Raab accidentally admits party then backtracks in car crash interviewThe Deputy PM told Kay Burley about a Downing Street party then stuttered no, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no -

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

Heres Wakefords letter in fullFormer Tory MP Christian Wakeford has resigned from the Conservative Party and defected to Labour Image: © UK Parliament BySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments Despite Bury Southend MP Christian Wakeford having only won his Conservative Party aposRed Wallapos seat in , the Tory MP has now defected to Labour.Boris Johnson has recently been urged by members of his own party, in letters of no confidence, to resign from his role following details about a string of Downing Street parties. Just moments before the Prime Minister was due to take the floor for Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Mr Wakeford wrote a letter to Mr Johnson, slamming his leadership and resigning from the Conservative Party. Responding to news of the letter and resignation, Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would aposwelcomeapos the former Tory Party member: He has always put the people of Bury South first. As Christian said, the policies of the Conservative government are doing nothing to help the people of Bury South and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse. Former Conservative MP Christian Wakefordaposs letter in full to Boris Johnson On Wednesday, January , , Conservative MP Christian Wakeford resigned from the party in a letter, and has now defected to the Labour Party. Mr Wakeford wrote: Dear Prime Minister,I am writing to inform you of my decision to resign from the Conservative Party and apply to join the Labour Party. From today I will be sitting as the Labour MP for Bury South because I have reached the conclusion that the best interests of my constituents are served by the programme put forward by Keir Starmer and his party. I care passionately about the people of Bury South and I have concluded that the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse. Britain needs a government focused on tackling the cost of living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all. It needs a government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves. Being elected as MP for Bury South was the proudest day of my le. I care passionately about the area and will always be grateful to those who have supported me. Today, however, I am in no doubt that they will be better served by my joining a party that genuinely has their interests at heart.  I have wrestled with my conscience for many months, and you will know that I have made my policy misgivings clear on many occasions in private and sometimes in public. I can no longer support a government that has shown itself consistently out of touch with the hard working people of Bury South and the country as a whole.He continued, outlining his decision to defect to the opposition Party and referring to Boris Johnsonaposs actions as aposdisgracefulapos, stating: Under Keir Starmer, the Labour Party is back firmly in the centre of British politics, in touch with working people, and ready to provide an alternative government that this country can be proud of, and not embarrassed by.My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks.  However, I don’t believe all politicians are the same and I do believe in the power of politics to be a force for good. So does Keir Starmer. He has shown that integrity in the way he has led his party on issues that matter to me, not least the vital challenge of combatting antisemitism. I will always put the people of Bury South first and will continue to speak out for the changes the area needs. Changes that can only be delivered by a Labour government with Keir Starmer. Yours, Christian Wakeford.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public. So decent people everywhere will wish the Prince of Wales well in his quest to improve the painfully strained relations with his son. If anyone has a chance of building bridges with Prince Harry, it’s his father.

A group of  Tory MPs elected in  met last night to discuss how they were going to oust the PM. According to swirling rumours, they were planning to all send letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  committee, expressing their lack of confidence in Mr Johnson. Still thereaposs no word of how many,any of them, have gone through with the plan. But that didnapost stop the PM calling them up, according to reports.  Mr Johnson is said to have cried as he begged for the group of  Tories to support him as he battles for his political le. When askedthe PM was in tears as he met the MPs, the PMaposs press secretary said: Iaposve seen that report, itaposs not true. The PMaposs Secretary admitted she was not there when they spoke. But she added a second time, itaposs not true.Christian Wakeford, who defected from the Conservative party to Labour this afternoon, was a Tory  MP who had been expressing his anger over the PMaposs handling of partygate for some time.Mr Wakeford was cheered by the Labour party as he sat on their benches. But Tories hissed and cried shocking at the same time.The gathering got its pork nickname as Alicia Kearns MP for Rutland and Melton hosted the gathering - Melton is the town best known for its pork pies.

Moments after he pledged to win the next election, the Prime Minister said certain measures will come to an end from Thursday. His announcement comes as part of the latest move from Downing Streetaposs aposOperation Red Meatapos - a number of measures rolled out to win back Tory support. The PM has been accused of removing public health protections in the hope of saving his own skin.Dr Saleyha Ahsan, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: Whilst the Prime Minister removes public health protections in the hope of saving his own skin,  families have tragically lost loved ones to Covid in the last  hours. He isn’t prioritising saving lives and, evenhe was, no one would take him seriously. How can anyone think that this is how le or death decisions should be made But Mr Johnson outlined his plans to start treating Covid like the flu.He told the Commons: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu.“As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. So what Covid restrictions are coming to an end  Mandatory Face masksFrom next Thursday, people in England will not need to wear face masks anywhere.Tomorrow, January , secondary school pupils will no longer need wear them in classrooms. Instead, the Government will recommend people wear face coverings in enclosed or private spaces. But it will ultimately be their choice.Mr Johnson told the Commons: In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces, particularly when you come into contact with people you donapost normally meet, but we will trust the judgement of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one.Teaching unions have said the move is premature.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teachersapos union said: No-one wants face masks for any longer than they have to be on... but I think this is premature - pupils have been back two weeks... and back in full-time education for about  days. Working from home guidanceWorking from home guidance has been dropped as of midday.People have been encouraged to work from homethey could since December .But it was guidance, which means it wasnapost legally binding. But the Government began to encourage it as a means of getting Covid cases down.Tory ministers have repeatedly emphasised how much worth they place on going into offices in person. In an apparent bid to please many Tories who had been calling for aposfreedomapos Mr Johnson said people will be free to commute into work and into busy offices once again. Covid vaccine passesMandatory Covid passes will end next week Thursday just as all restrictions expire on January . Since December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England have had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. Mr Johnson had previously suggested the definition of ‘vaccinated’ for a Covid pass would be updated from two to three doses.

The national leaderaposs alleged contempt for the rules put in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus across the past two years has caused fury throughout the nation.In response to the frustration - which stems from millions of Brits making huge sacrices, including not being able to be with elderly loved ones - an investigation has been launched into the string of gatherings. At the helm of investigation sits Sue Gray, the most powerful person youaposve never heard of. Who is Sue Gray   Senior civil servant Sue Gray served as Director General of Propriety and Ethics in the Cabinet Office between  and .Before this, she worked in the departments of Transport, Health and Work and Pensions. After these roles, she took a career break in the late s to run a pub in Northern Ireland before joining the Cabinet Office in the s.She now holds the role of the Second Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Office, a role charged with leading on the Union and the Constitution.When is the Sue Gray report into Downing Street party allegations   The report is expected towards the end of this week or early next - the exact date remains to be confirmed. The reason no one has any hard and fast answers about the reportaposs release date stems from the additional revelations cropping up about more parties alleged to have taken place. What does the Sue Gray investigation cover   The primary purpose of Grayaposs report is, according to the Cabinet Office, to: Establish swtly a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose, with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time.The scope of the report initially set out to cover the Downing Street Christmas parties on November  and December , but the number of dates under the microscope has now been extended to include two parties that took place on the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral on April . According to the terms of reference set out for the investigation: Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.They also state that: If required, the investigations will establish whether inidual disciplinary action is warranted. The terms set out that investigators will have access to documents and will be able to speak to staff throughout its course. Is the Sue Gray investigation independent  One key concern remains, however, about the independence of the investigation. This is because despite being at the heart of Grayaposs explorations, Boris Johnson is also the person who gets to decidethe next stage of the investigation can actually go ahead.After Grayaposs report, Johnson will have the final say as to whether the Prime Minister’s advisor on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, can actually start an investigation into any breaches of ministerial code.Speaking on the matter, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “The PM has set the terms of Sue Gray’s probe and he has chosen to exclude the conduct of Ministers from it, creating a neat loophole for himself.“Any judgement on the conduct of Boris Johnson goes to... Boris Johnson. “A farcical circular process from a Prime Minister that will escape responsibility in any way he can.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided. History will be justiably unkind to a truly terrible leader.

Some of the plotters include Bishop Auckland MP Dehenna Davison Chris Loder, who hosted the group’s last meeting Gary Sambrook , the first Tory to hold Birmingham Northfield since , as well as Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, who is best-known for cursing at scandal-hit colleague Owen Paterson in the Commons.Who has called for the Prime Minister to resign  Seven Tory MPs have publicly called for Johnsonaposs resignation. Wakeford – who has a majority of just  – was the latest to make the call for the Prime Minister to resign on Tuesday. He then defected to Labour just before Wednesdayaposs Prime Ministeraposs Questions, citing Johnson as incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves. Though only a handful of Tories have publicly called for his resignation, several of them are believed to be furious over Johnsonaposs handling of the Partygate scandal. They were angered further by the PMaposs statement that nobody told him that the party at Downing Street was a violation of the country-wide rules he himself had set.Whataposs likely to happen next  An inquiry into the Downing Street parties, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, is expected to be published on either Friday or early next week.Some MPs are reported to be waiting for Ms Gray’s findings before deciding on submitting a letter to Sir Graham. If the  letters needed to trigger a no confidence vote is reached, the next step will see Tory MPs voting on whether they have confidence in in the Prime Minister. Johnson will need % or more of MPs to back him or end up losing his position. If he does end up winning, then the MPs will be barred from forcing another vote on his premiership for the next  months.

Writing in the British Medical Journal, their study claims that the rapid kits were not as effective in youngsters and students, even as all secondary school students in Britain are encouraged to use them twice weekly. Their findings said that the tests only detected  per cent of Covid positive children. When the children had symptoms of Covid, like a cough or change or loss to the sense of taste and smell, detection rates increased to  per cent.  This means only little over half the youngsters who had the virus were caught. The authors said their findings meant that lateral flow tests would fail to meet the minimum standards of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the US’ Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation. These three bodies all require Covid testing kits to meet a minimum of around an  per cent success rate.  The study only included samples taken by professionally trained iniduals and not self testing at home.This comes as Omicron cases continue to fall, day-on-day, amidst hopes the fourth waves has peaked.One of the authors, Dr Naomi Fujita-Rohwerder, of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care in Cologne, Germany, said: “Taking into account test-specic pooled results, no test included in this review fully satisfied the minimum performance requirements as recommended by WHO...the US…or the MHRA in the UK.  “This may affect the planned purpose of the broad implementation of testing programmes.” The report only examined studies that used eight dferent lateral flow kits, so some of the + tests available globally may be more accurate. All of the studie looked at in the new analysis were published between the start of  and May  meaning they will not have contained the Omicron iant.  The researchers did not offer any reasons why the tests had performed less accurately on children, or a comparative study in adults. Regular and freely available lateral flow tests are a key part of the UK’s response to Covid and containing it.

Tom - real name Bokejon Akram - was a Russian soldier and school teacher taken as a POW by the Third Reich. They took him to the occupied Channel Island of Jersey as a slave but he managed to escape and was taken in by Phyliss and John. They risked their lives by hiding him in their house where he had trap door escape routes.Have your say on this story in the comment section He told their five young kids fairy stories and even kept a diary - just like the teenage Anne Frank in Amsterdam. The family called him aposTomapos and taught him English – partly by reading the Bible with him. He survived with them for three years and was repatriated to the Ukraine in  by the British. They lost touch after the war and the familyaposs story has now emerged as officials at Jersey Heritage try to discover more about him. Phyliss and Emilyaposs grand-daughter Carolyn Horn, , said she was immensely proud of what her family risked to save Tomaposs le. Carolyn, who lives in Cyprus with her husband and three children, said: He became a member of the family. aposaposMy aunt said she called him her favourite uncle, as that was how he was known - Uncle Tom. My grandmother used to talk about Tom all the time. It just shows what kind people they were. It makes me proud.  It was a time of crisis and they had German soldiers walking in whenever. aposaposThey still risked their own lives, and the lives of their children, to help someone who they didnapost even know and let live in their house as a member of their family. There was a little door under the staircase in the house with a trap door behind it - that is how Tom could get from one side of the house to the other.aposapos Phyliss and John are reported to have said: We trusted this man, he was the sort of man we could trust. The children loved him and, when he could understand some English, he used to read them fairy stories. Tomaposs journey began in July  when the young Ukrainian soldier and unmarried school teacher defended his country against German attack. During a two hour period , of his colleagues died and Tom alongside many other Ukrainians became a PoW. The German soldiers collected thousands of people and used them as slave labourers to quarry stone and build coastal defences.  Tom then found himself with , others taken to St Malo in Jersey in July . He was put into hard labour but managed to run away and was found in St Mary - by Phyliss, John, and their four very young children. They were nervous and so renamed Bokejon as Tom to reduce the risk of discoverytheir kids said anything.  Tom slept in in the stables behind a trap door, in a car hidden behind bales of straw and in a shed in case the Germans called. Phylissaposs daughter Dulcie, now in her s, remembers him reading fairy stories to the children and playing with them. Dulcie, who was four when the Occupation began, remembers Tom like a favourite uncle. In May , before repatriation to the Ukraine by British forces, Tom promised to keep in contact.  Three letters arrived in June  from Guernsey where Tom was last known to be - but then nothing. Years later John was one of  Jersey men and women awarded a gold watch by the Soviet government for their courage in helping to shelter Russian and Ukrainian escapees. Historians at Jersey Heritage have now issued a plea for anyone to come forward with more information about him. Chris Addy, sites curator, said they were surprised how much they had been able to find out about them.He said: It’s always a bit of a guess. You never know what stories are going to come out after  years.It’s always fascinating to hear a new piece of information or research, and add it to the stories that we tell each year to remind people about this signicant part of the Island’s history.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Uncle TomAnne FrankEducationSoldiersNazis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the days after Christmas, Jacqueline Sievewright discovered that all her debit and credit cards were no longer working and that she didnapost have a ing bank account. The baffled -year-old borrowed money from her -year-old mum before getting hold of someone at Halax, which sheaposd banked with for years. An operator told her her both her inidual and joint accounts had been closed due to a computer glitch following the death of her husband Francis, who died of pancreatic cancer in October. Despite spending days frantically trying to sort out the issue, cash transfers and direct debits are still bouncing off of Jacquelineaposs frozen accounts. They blocked everything. My credit card, direct debits, standing orders, state pension and private pension was rejected, and money coming in, the Immingham, Lincolnshire woman told the Mirror. I am still grieving. Last Thursday everything just got on top of me. For two days I just cried and cried. I was so low I felt like ending it all. Jacqueline first knew something was amiss the week after Christmas, when her mumaposs attempts to transfer money into her bank account failed. When the former Norfolk County Council worker tried to log in to her online account, it told her she wasnapost registered. She called Halax where an operator explained that the issue was not due to a human error, but a computer glitch. Jacqueline then embarked on several days of calling the bank and sending in her husbandaposs death certicate in a fruitless bid to get the accounts brought back online. She later received a call from Halax telling her requesting a money from a branch would be pointless and that her complaint, despite being unresolved, had been closed internally. I canapost just rely on my -year-old mum for money, Jacqueline said. I spent two days from am to pm ringing round  dferent companies resetting direct debits and informing them of the change of circumstances. I then reinstated two dormant accounts with Natwest and HSBC so I could do some shopping. Two weeks on, Jacquelineaposs accounts have suddenly been reinstated by Halax, which sent her flowers as an apology. The confusing situation has been particularly dficult for Jacqueline as she recently lost her husband Francis. The retired banker fell ill in February last year and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In the eight months before he died in October, he spent five and a half in hospital. Jacqueline was able to bring him home from hospital to be with her in his final days. A Lloyds Bank spokesperson said: “We were so sorry to hear of Mrs Sievewright’s loss and the experience she had when she got in touch. Mrs Sievewright’s accounts are up and running again, we’ve provided training and feedback to our team, and we’ll be getting in touch with her to put things right.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatWestHalax Inc.HSBCBanksHospitalsPensionsCredit cardsState pensionComputers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Taking their seats, Kate, , who arrived in a smart navy coat and a black polo neck for the engagement in central London, asked the experts: From your experience what makes the dference between a young person succeeding after leaving foster care and when they do not. They heard about challenges for young people when they regularly move home and are sometimes exploited by the criminal world. William added: If you keep moving a child around when they are an adult their relationships are so short and shallow. Kate said she was concerned that without providing stable homes for children they risk being moved around and having to tell their story again and again. Will said: That may become emotionally exhausting to tell the story again and again. Weaposve had that in the mental health side of things, people end up on the street, go through hoops and hurdles, tell so many people in authority and nothing changes. You have to get to them a lot earlier so they donapost have to keep doing this. Later as they left the event William, , could not avoid the drama of his own family as a TV crew asked the Duke do you support Prince Andrew  as the couple left the museum. The Duke leaned closer to hear but then walked past without commenting. Part of their engagement, handpicked by the couple to be their first event of the year, saw them discuss the worry about the consistency in care:  Olympic hero runner Kris Akabusi, poet Lemn Sissay, and Allan Jenkins, editor of Observer Food Monthly, told the Duke and Duchess their experiences of growing up in care. Akabusi said: I enjoyed the stability. It was a saviour for me. He said leaving care aged -years-old was very traumatic. Kate replied: You are petried leaving for independence. She asked the m hurdlerit had affected his relationships. Kris, with his distinctive laugh, replied: Yes, but I am a loner. He added: Now aged  there is no stigma attached when I say I was brought up in care but there was a stigma when I was . Women who had previously been in care then joined the couple in an aposice-breakerapos armed with three-foot long pencils. They drew on a canvas what they could see in front of them without looking down at the floor. Kate - who scored a master of arts degree in art history at St Andrews University - laughed out as she struggled with the artwork which had the look of a vast doodle when it was finished. Duke laughed and said: I enjoyed it. The kids would really enjoy that. Viewing their masterpiece, he added: Thataposs beautul. Athlete Kris Akabusi said afterwards: It is great to have so many vital resources for young people. As a young person in care, to know people at the top are interested in your story and growth as an adult is very encouraging. Hopefully they are not forgotten. Young people who were in care are over-represented in gangs, sex industry and crime, I hope society has not forgotten them as these children are in care throigh no fault of their ownnso it is great to have this infrastructure. The Foundling Museum tells the history of the Foundling Hospital, the UK’s first children’s charity. It was founded in  as a home for children whose mothers couldn’t keep or care for them. The Museum delivers training, mentorship programmes and creative projects, led and developed by contemporary artists, writers and musicians, to continue to use creative action to transform and improve the lives of care-experienced young people.

Decomposing bits of food were also strewn across the floor in addition to a layer of dust which suggested it hadnapost been cleaned for some time, David claims.He says hotel staff were apologetic but he worries rooms are not being deep cleaned amidst the Covid- pandemic. David told the Record: We booked a few nights away in Inverness to see some old friends and on the morning of January  I dropped my keys down the back of the bed, where the headboard is. I pulled the bed out and there was a dirty pair of ladiesapos underwear and there was also bits of food and a disgusting amount of dust. You could see it clearly hadnapost been touched in a while. We certainly didnapost expect a room like this, especially with the virus going round. The website of the hotel in Inverness, Scotland, promises daily housekeeping as part of its services.  And a statement from parent company IHG on the webpage promises: IHG has a long-standing commitment to rigorous cleaning procedures. However, David remains concerned that hotels arenapost giving rooms a proper clean in between guests. He added: The hotel staff were apologetic and switched our room and let us stay for nothing. That doesnapost bother us but people need to know whataposs going on in hotels. That area of the room has just totally been ignored. If it had been lovely and clean behind the bed and we found a pair of underwear you would think it might be a one-off. But it was clear the bed hadnapost been moved for a while. It ruined the rest of our stay. Youaposd expect to find the room completely clean, especially now.. A spokesman for the Holiday Inn Express said: Overall, the Holiday Inn Express Inverness has an excellent record for cleanliness however on this occasion there was a clear lapse in standards. The hotel apologised to the guest regarding this matter, which was immediately rectied directly with the guest.

With many of the symptoms of the Omicron Covid iant similar to a cold, it can be hard for Brits to know the dference.The symptoms of the new iant are slightly dferent from others such as Delta, and it’s incredibly important to get tested, especially as they can be mild.The most common symptoms we associate with coronavirus is a new continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and smell, according to the official list on the NHS website.But with Omicron people are being warned to be vigilant of other classic cold symptoms, such as headaches, sore throats and sneezing.Professor Spector from the ZOE Covid app said data suggests about half of all cases of Delta are being missed because people are only on the lookout for the “classic” Covid symptoms. Do I have Omicron or a cold  The Omicron iant has many symptoms that are similar to the common cold. According to ZOE data scientists, the top five symptoms of Omicron are:Runny nose Headache FatigueSneezingSore throat  According to the NHS, the most common cold symptoms are:A blocked or runny nose A sore throat Headaches Coughs Sneezing A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smellWith many of the symptoms overlapping, there is no guaranteed way to tell the dference without a test.Professor Spector said: For most people, an Omicron positive case will feel much more like the common cold, starting with a sore throat, runny nose and a headache.You only need to ask a friend who has recently tested positive to find this out. We need to change public messaging urgently to save lives.The safest thing to do, and the only way to know for sure, is to get a PCR testyou have any of these symptoms. You can book a test for free on the NHS website.What to do while you wait for your test results  Dr Habil Khorakiwala, founder and chair of Wockhardt Group, has uploaded a video where he shares six things you can do at home while you wait for your PCR test result. He explains: There are six simple precautions which you may take, and may certainly help in preventing the infection and definitely reduces the severity of symptoms, especially of Omicron.  These are as follows: Step one – gargle with warm salt water Gargle deeply with warm salt water, or a medical mouthwash, three to four times a day. This has been proven in several studies to reduce the saliva viral load for several hours. Step two – steam inhalation Steam inhalation can help ease your symptoms, whether it be a cold or Covid. This is a great trick to soothe and open nasal passages when suffering from a cold or sinus infection. Dr Khorakiwala recommends doing this two to three times a day.  Step three – avoid cold drinks Dr Khorakiwala recommends avoiding drinking cold and chilled beverages. However, itaposs important to stay hydrated, so Dr Khorakiwala recommends drinking hot water frequently. Step four – breathing exercises Dr Khorakiwala recommends practising some form of breathing exercises, such as deep breathing, for at least five minutes a day. Step five – physical exercise Try to do  to  minutes of physical activity daily. Those who arenapost able to do that much should do as much as possible without overexerting themselves. Step six – remember to wear a mask Most importantly, Dr Khorakiwala says we should wear the right-fitting mask properly. He says to only use three-ply surgical masks or N masks. Dr Khorakiwala continued: Avoid common cloth masks and fancy design masks. If necessary, use them only as a double mask over the recommended mask.

Using fake email addresses, he convinced her shed been drugged and sexually abused in her own home, and that they had bought a house togetherCarwyn Roberts used fake email addresses to torment and control his girlfriend Image: WALES NEWS SERVICEByJason EvansRyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan  A cruel and manipulative man used fake email addresses and  identities to control his girlfriendaposs le – even convincing her sheaposd been drugged and sexually abused in her own home.Carwyn Roberts, , created fake identities of people in positions of trust, like doctors and lawyers, to spin a web of lies which ranged from the couple buying a house together to convincing the vulnerable woman she was pregnant. He also persuaded her to leave her job at a school by telling her heaposd secured her a new role with the local council. Mold Crown Court heard this week how Roberts subjected his victim to years of torment, which has had a devastating effect on her mental health.Jade Tufail, prosecuting, told the court how Roberts and his victim met on the dating website Plenty of Fish in  and immediately got along. Soon the defendant moved into her flat in Bangor and the relationship was described as amazing with the womanaposs young daughter referring to the defendant as daddy Carwyn. The court heard the womanaposs previous relationship had ended acrimoniously and had left her in a bad way – including engaging in self-harming – and she told her new boyfriend about these issues. The prosecutor said Roberts told the woman he had found out he was was inheriting £, from his grandfatheraposs brother and he would use the money to buy their dream home. The couple went to view houses and settled on one in a new Redrow development in Bangor, and Roberts said his familyaposs solicitors would handle all the legal work. In fact there was no money and there was no family lawyer doing the conveyancing work, and the emails the woman began receiving about the house purchase were being sent by her partner from a bogus account he had set up. This was to be the start of months of cruel deception perpetrated by the defendant. The court heard Roberts then began to tell his partner he was receiving prank calls from people claiming she was being unfaithful and that the solicitor was looking into who was sending them. As the weeks progressed the fake solicitor said he had found out that there were hidden cameras in her flat which had filmed her having sex with men, and he began to quiz her about her sex le. The woman was adamant no such activity had taken place but Roberts, through the bogus solicitor, told her the reason she couldnapost remember what had happened was because she had been drugged before being sexually abused and that the police were now involved. Miss Tufail said while this was going on the defendant created another fake person, this time a woman by the name of Amanda Davies who supposedly worked with him in the local authority, who also began emailing his partner. His victim was persuaded by Amanda Davies to give up her employment in a local school with the promise of job in the council, and Roberts even came home with a work badge in his partneraposs name along with training and induction materials. Again this was all a lie. Then one day the fake council email account contacted the victim to say her partner had been drugged at work in a leisure centre in Caernarfon by an associate of her ex-boyfriend. Over the following days further emails were sent, supposed containing information from a nurse, saying the drugging incident had affected Robertsapos sperm and he would now not be able to have children. The court heard how the victim broke down crying at this news as she had wanted a child with the defendant. The Amanda Davies email account then started giving the woman instructions about having sex with Roberts in order to maximise their chances of conceiving. Meanwhile the charade about the purchase of non-existent house was still continuing and even went so far as the victim, her daughter, and the defendant packing up their possessions ready for the move. Miss Tufail said that by this point the victim had effectively been brainwashed into doing whatever the people in the emails told her to do.The months of lying culminated with Roberts coming home one day with an ultrasound scan showing a pregnancy with twins and telling his partner she was pregnant.This was followed-up by emails from a doctor sent from yet another bogus account he had created. It later transpired the defendant had carried out extensive internet searches in order to obtain a fake ultrasound image. The court heard the victim was confused about the scan and emails from the doctor confirming her pregnancy but the couple went to see her brother to tell the family the happy news. It was the brotheraposs partner who spotted something was amiss with the scan and raised the alarm. The police were contacted and an investigation uncovered the full extent of the defendantaposs deceit. In his first interview the -year-old defendant claimed he had his partner had been duped by somebody  but in his second interview he changed his story and said he, in fact, was the victim of domestic abuse at the hands of his partner. In a statement from the partner which was read to the court she explained the impact the months of lies had had on her. She said she felt ashamed and manipulated and said Roberts had been aware of her vulnerabilities and had exploited every single one of them. Carwyn Grfith Roberts, of Cae Llyn, Llanaelhaearn, Caernarfon, had previously pleaded guilty on the day of trial to engaging in controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship when he appeared in the dock for sentencing. He has no previous convictions. Richard Edwards, for Roberts, said at the time of the offending the defendant was conscious of his own perceived inadequacies and wanted to make himself look better in the eyes of his partner. However matters escalated and – in his clientaposs own words – the lies got bigger and bigger. The barrister said Roberts was taking part in counselling to address the issues in his le and added that he was now in a new relationship with someone who aware of the court case and who was supportive of him. Judge Niclas Parry told Roberts thatthe offending were not so serious people hearing the bizarre facts of the case would be rendered incredulous. He told the defendant he had taken advantage of a vulnerable woman to control her le, adding: Your conduct was as cruel as it was manipulative and despicable. With a % discount for his guilty plea Roberts was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years and was ordered to complete a rehabilitation course and  hours of unpaid work. He must also pay £, towards prosecution costs. The defendant was made the subject of a lelong restraining order banning him from contacting his former partner or posting anything about her on social media. Speaking after the hearing Rhian Jones, senior crown prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Servicein Wales, said: The level of manipulation that Carwyn Roberts exerted on his partner is quite staggering and the effect on her mental health must have been awful. The CPS were able to build a strong case showing the number of fake accounts and emails could be traced back to him, demonstrating he had told lie after lie. The victim can take comfort in knowing that Roberts is now paying for the horrendous ordeal he put her through and we hope this helps her move forward with her le.

Similarly, his Instagram page, which has a blue veried tick and is followed by the official Royal Family account, has been made private, while the profile picture and some information has also disappeared from his Facebook page.A source told MailOnline that Andrewaposs social media channels were in the process of being removed but some were taking longer to filter through. The source added: The changes have been made to reflect the recent statement from Buckingham Palace regarding The Duke of York.The bombshell statement from Buckingham Palace came last Thursday, announcing that Andrew would be stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages he had been given by the Queen.The disgraced Duke of York will no longer use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity as he fades away from public le forever.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted.

Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. At every turn the Queen has handled Harry’s behaviour with good grace, wishing him well and extending a loving sentiment that he and his family would always be much loved members of her own.

But an increasing body of data is helping that processAccording to the ZOE Covid App, there are nine common symptoms among vaccinated people Image: Getty ImagesByHarry Thompson:,  Jan | commentsOmicron is is still everywhere and despite very promising signs among the numbers of new cases in the UK, tens of thousands of people continue to pick up the virus every day. The announcement that Plan B measures, which mandated people wearing masks and working from home where possible, will be lted on January  comes as welcome news to many.Because of the still-high numbers, the likelihood of fewer masks, and public places and transport getting a little busier in the coming weeks, it is important to know what to look out for.It is also important for the millions who have been vaccinated to be familiar with Covid symptoms and be able to recognise how they may dfer from symptoms among the unvaccinated. An array of studies has found that Omicron is, on the whole, a milder iant of the virus, with the first official UK report finding that it is between  and % less likely to cause hospitalisation than Delta.Despite this, getting your booster jab remains the best way to protect yourself and those around you from the virus. What symptoms should people look out forthey are vaccinated   Although its findings are not peer-reviewed, the ZOE Covid app study is a useful indicator that pools together the symptoms experienced by people who have tested positive for the virus.Data collected by it has found there are nine symptoms that keep cropping up. Professor Tim Spector, who is one of the key figures behind the project told newsGP : The  million reports submitted via the study’s app have shown that as the virus has evolved, so too have the symptoms it causes. Back in , it quickly became clear that the original and Alpha versions of the coronavirus caused three very common symptoms – cough, fever and loss of smell – as well as at least  others. When Delta appeared, we then noticed a sht in the most frequently reported symptoms. Cold-like symptoms – including a runny nose, sore throat and persistent sneezing – became more common, along with a headache and cough, particularly in people who had been vaccinated. He added: It’s causing symptoms that are much more like a regular cold, particularly in people who’ve been vaccinated, and fewer general systemic symptoms, such as nausea, muscle pains, diarrhoea and skin rashes. This means the nine common symptoms among the vaccinated according to respondents who have added their data to the ZOE Covid app are:Runny noseSore throatSneezing Headache Cough Nausea Muscle painsDiarrhoeaSkin rashThese are of course not necessarily the only things to keep an eye out for but are handy to know aboutyou find yourself developing any of these symptoms.

But theyaposve had several homes together since they first started dating almost six years ago. After they became engaged, Meghan moved in to Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. But after their wedding, they wanted somewhere bigger to raise a family and went to the Queen with an idea. But according to a report the pair faced disappointment when the monarch rejected the request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.  The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate.

He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Before the birth of Archie, the couple moved into their Frogmore Cottage home, later than expected due to delays with renovation work. Itaposs just over two years since they moved out of Frogmore and started their new le in the US. But it has now emerged that Harry does not want to bring Meghan and their two children to the UK to visit, saying there is a lack of security. The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office unless he can have police protection for his family when in the UK. He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit.

Satellite data shows unusual atmospheric gravity waves since Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai’s eruption on Saturday which triggered massive ft tsunamis, devastating the island nation. The massive blast also created unusual gravity waves stretching around , kilometres, which have never been seen before, reports Nature. The data was collected by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounderon board a Nasa satellite orbiting the planet. Lars Hoffmann, an atmospheric scientist at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre in Germany, said: “It’s really unique. We have never seen anything like this in the data before.What do you make of the mystery ripples  Have your say in the comment section “This instrument has been operating for something like  years now and we have never seen such nice concentric wave patterns.” The pictures show dozens of concentric circles in the atmosphere which possibly cross the planet several times. Scott Osprey, from the University of Oxford, believes the eruption’s speed could possibly have caused the mystery waves.  One of the possible effects of the waves is the reversal of wind direction which could have an impact in Europe. He added: “This event seems to have been over in minutes, but it was explosive and it’s that impulse that is likely to kick off some strong gravity waves. “We’ll be looking very carefully at how that evolves.”  Hundreds of homes in Tongaaposs smaller outer islands are feared to have been destroyed in the tsunami, with at least three dead. Information on the scale of devastation has come mostly from reconnaissance aircraft as the nation’s airport is smothered by ash and communications have been hampered. Teams from The Red Cross say drinking water has been polluted by salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash. Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Haaposapai has erupted regularly over the past few decades but the impact of Saturdayaposs blast was felt as far away as Japan and the United States. The eruption was also detected by volunteer meteorologists in Hastings, East Sussex.

Rhianna was enjoying out in a bar in Newcastle city centre on January  when three of her female friends suddenly became unwell. The Northumbria University student said two of the group, who had been sharing the same drink, started to be violently sick at the venue - with one even needing to be carried out by a bouncer.Speaking to Chronicle Live , -year-old Rhianna said: When we got home their breathing was raspy and their eyes were dilated.  They could all hear what I was saying to them but they couldnapost make sense of it. Rhianna took her friends to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead as they became increasingly unwell. I called an ambulance as [my friend] Sara [Begic] was especially bad, she said. Her breathing wasnapost right, she was hyperventilating. She wasnapost responding and going in and out of consciousness. They werenapost any ambulances available but they said aposyou need to get her to hospital now.apos All three women underwent tests to see whether they had been spiked. Rhianna said they are still waiting on the results. Sara Begic, , from Durham, believes her drink was spiked during the incident and is now worried about going out again following her ordeal. The Northumbria University law student said: It was horrible. The last thing I remember is sitting with my friends. I knew where I was but I just couldnapost do anything. I couldnapost move my body and the bouncer carried me out. I feel quite unsafe going out now. The group of friends revealed that this isnapost actually the first time they believe they have been spiked while on a night out in the city. One of the students, who did not want to be named, said she was spiked by an injection in her leg on December . She became ill later that night and went to hospital to be checked out the following morning. I felt like I had been possessed and my body felt freezing, she said. It was like I couldn’t physically stop myself from shaking it was probably the worst experience of my le. I don’t feel completely safe going back out again. Rhianna said the friends reported the injection spiking incident to the police but believed that the venue had been unable to help officers because of its poor CCTV footage. As a result, they decided not to report the second incident, which happened at the same venue. However, the friends hope that sharing their story will encourage others to be vigilant when on a night out. Just because people have stopped posting about [spiking] doesnapost mean that it isnapost still happening, Rhianna said. Northumbria Police confirmed that an investigation is ongoing into the reported injection spiking incident and stressed that dedicated officers are on patrol to ensure the city remains a safe place for a night out.A Northumbria Police spokeswoman said: We can confirm we have received a report from a woman concerned she had been spiked with an injection while on a night out in Newcastle on December . “An investigation has been launched and enquiries into this incident are ongoing.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Northumbria PoliceCCTVCCTV footageTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Owners of The Isle of Barra Distillers decided to shorten the working week in a bid to offer workers more flexibility. The company says it hopes to give its tightly-knit team the opportunity to spend more time with loved ones and spend less time and money commuting. Ahead of the change, which began this month, employees agreed to work the same hours over fewer days - with people opting to work an extra two hours each sht. They have switched up their operation to make the transition work - meaning that orders are no longer being dispatched on a Friday.

She said: The main kind of reason behind it is to offer work-le balance for each team member. Being on Barra, itaposs not so easy to get away without booking holidays so it lets staff travel to the mainland without hassle. Last weekend, two staff members took advantage and travelled for the three days they were off. Itaposs been a really positive start. She added: I think we felt two days a week was never long enough. Itaposs just given us more time. We donapost have to use as much holiday because we have the long weekend to get everything done. Itaposs already allowed us to have more time with family and friends.

The -year-old says the two major mix-ups have caused a heavy burden of stress, leaving her unable to properly grieve for her late mum, Stoke-on-TrentLive reports. Sharon informed Stoke-on-Trent City council after her beloved motheraposs death on December  and cleared the home.She ed the keys to the authority in a letter that clearly stated the address, she claims.  At the bottom, she included her own address in nearby Dale Avenue and contact details, as requested, in case there were any queries, according to Stoke-on-Trent Live. On December , Sharon was dumbfounded to received a phone call from a friend while she was at work, stating that council workers had forced their way into her home. She said: I was at work when I got a phone call, and I was getting lots of messages, saying the council were breaking into my house. I had to leave work and go home to find they had broken in through the front door. Apparently they had been told that I had done a moonlight flit and the house was empty. There were three vans outside. They had been traipsing though the house. My friend had told they they had the wrong address. By the time I got back, they had gone. The front door handle was all loose because they hadnapost fixed it properly. I felt unsafe in my own house after  years of living there. Sharon, who lives at the property with her -year-old son Reece, contacted Stoke-on-Trent City Council after the mix-up. She said: The woman I spoke to couldnapost apologise enough. They sent me a bunch of flowers and said they would compensate me for the time I lost at work, although I havenapost received that yet.  But it shouldnapost have happened in the first place. I canapost understand how the council could get the address wrong. Thinking that was the end of the matter, Sharon was at home watching TV on January  when her electricity and gas suddenly went off. When she spoke to British Gas, she was told the council had informed them her property was empty. She said: At first I thought it was a power cut but when I looked out I saw it was only my house. I rang British Gas and explained what had happened and they said I had been cut off.  She said they were told by the council in December that the house was empty and the account had been closed. I have had to open a new account to get it sorted out.Sharon, who works at Jackmark Engineering in Longport, says the situation has made what is already an upsetting time even worse.Iaposve not had time to grieve over my mum because Iaposve been so busy sorting out the councilaposs mess. Iaposm a nervous wreck and Iaposm crying all the time.It has been one phone call after another trying to sort out whataposs going on. Iaposve even rung Severn Trent to make sure my water isnapost going to be cut off as well. Iaposm disgusted by the councilaposs ineptitude. A city council spokesman said: Firstly, we would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Sharon and her family for their loss at this very dficult time. We have , council properties and regrettably a genuine administrative mistake was made on this occasion that incorrectly listed the tenancy for ending, which resulted in a lock change being arranged. As part of that process, utility companies are automatically notied at the same time. However, we appreciate this shouldnapost have happened and we have spoken to Sharon and apologised unreservedly.

I got the house ready for her coming home, and decorated it so it was nice and fresh. We had lots of balloons up for the day she got out of hospital. I even had a sausage sandwich ready for her as she hadnapost had one in ages.The family had a small gathering to welcome Elizabeth into her new home but tragically days later Elizabeth, Caitlin, her mum Deborah, auntie Jacqui, sister Beth and uncle George, all tested positive for coronavirus. Caitlin said: She got out of hospital and then we caught Covid three days later. My gran was ok at first, but a few nights later she went downhill and I had to phone an ambulance. She didnapost want to go into hospital. She was really upset and scared she wouldnapost get back out. But it was the best place for her as she needed oxygen. On Monday, November  my gran was told she was getting on Tuesday and an ambulance had been arranged to bring her home. That night she took a turn for the worst. The hospital called and told me to go up, but when I arrived to see her she wasnapost herself. We just had to sit with her until she died.  Elizabeth died in the early hours of Tuesday November  at Glasgow Royal Infirmary after her lung collapsed due to Covid complications. Tragedy struck again when Caitlinaposs uncle George - Elizabethaposs son-in-law - died from coronavirus in the same hospital on November  just four days later. The devastated family were left to plan two funerals and fork out thousands of pounds. Caitlin began to fear for her future as she was never added to her granaposs tenancy agreement. Less than three weeks after her granaposs sudden death, she met with Cadder Housing and on December  she was told their hands were tied and she was given three weeks to evict the property.  Caitlin was then admitted to hospital with MS and Cadder gave her an extension until January . I completely understand Iaposm not on the tenancy agreement but we never thought anything like this would happen, Caitlin said. I never wanted to stay here permanently, as Iaposm not in a wheelchair and the house could go to someone  who needs it. I only wanted to stay here until I had somewhere  to go. They told me to contact Shelter Scotland and said they had been trying to get me temporary accommodation through the council. My MS has got worse with the stress and so has my mental health. I havenapost even had time to grieve the loss of my gran and my uncle. I felt like they could have at least said you can stay until you find somewhere  to go. They didnapost even offer to help with storage. Caitlin now faces sleeping on her auntieaposs couch after she is evicted and has nowhere to move into full-time.Her sister, brothers and cousins have now set up a fundraising page to try and pay for temporary accommodation so Caitlin has somewhere to live.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mental healthHomelessnessCoronavirusMultiple sclerosisSepsisHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Two-year-old Otis Morgan managed to get his hands on his dadaposs clippers when they were left on charge outside the bathroom while his mum Faith, , was folding laundry. And with his mumaposs back turned, cheeky Otis decided to switch on the clippers and go to own on his own hair, shaving half of his head and giving himself a unique trim. The toddler then crawled into his mumaposs bedroom, where Faith finally realised what had happened and began to laugh - becauseshe didnapost, she would have cried.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: I had to laugh. I mean you either choose to laugh or cry in situations like that. He was playing with his sisteraposs unicorn toy which makes a buzzing noise as it spins around, so I didnapost even register the buzzing noise of the clippers. Having seen his daddy shave his hair regularly he obviously decided to try them himself. He wandered back into my bedroom and I saw that he had hair on his sleeve. I honestly thought he had been hugging our cat and was surprised at how much he had been shedding. But it didnapost take me long to realise there was far too much hair for it to be the cat! Then I saw the damage he had done and asked him what had happened.  The mum admitted she did shed a few tears at the idea of having to shave her sonaposs locks completely off, and she later booked an appointment with a hairdresser to get the disastrous trim fixed. She added: I must admit I did cry later at the idea that we might have to shave all his hair off. Just because of how drastically dferent he would suddenly look! It isnapost too noticeable now and is something to make people smile. Heaposs a cheeky monkey so they are used to his antics! Faith also posted pictures of Otisapos unique look on a Facebook parenting group to ask for advice, as she really didnapost want to shave the totaposs hair. She wrote: So my husband left his hair clippers on charge and my yr old found them.  I know these things happenand I know it will grow back but has anyone had their child do something similar and have pictures of how you styled it to make it look Ok  I really donapost want to shave all his hair off. And although people were left in stitches by the youngsteraposs look, they also told Faith not to worry. One person said: I’m sorry to laugh but this is hilarious. Bless him. The hairdresser will sort it don’t worry. Definitely save these pics for his th st wedding day. As another added: Bless him! We have all had kids cut their hair. It is like a rite of passage for each kid. Sending hugs!  While other commenters shared similar stories about their own children. Someone posted: My son cut his hair so short to his scalp when he was . I had to shave his whole head. When we went out a man askedhe has cancer! I was heartbroken. I do sympathise with you. And another wrote: Got to laugh, my daughter shaved her eyebrows and cut her own fringe, thought the we was going to die from the panic attack, I thought I was going to die because I couldn’t stop laughing. Faith said some people on Facebook also gave her styling tips, but sheaposs thankful she didnapost need to do anything extreme to Otisapos hair. She said: A lot of people thought it looked like he had a mullet and said he should keep it because it was making a comeback! Others say he was trying to style his hair like his dad, who has a shaved head. There were suggestions of styling it like a Peaky Blinders haircut or a mohawk but we didnapost go quite that extreme in the end. Iaposm so relieved that we managed to get away without having to go down that route. Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

So, when one woman failed her first driving test in her native London, instead of re-booking locally, she decided to travel approximately  miles to the Isle of Mull, just off the west coast of Scotland, in search of the UKaposs aposeasiestapos test. Constance Kampfner spent  hours travelling north, by car and ferry, having handpicked the test route after discovering it only consisted of one roundabout her biggest fear. However, on arrival, she struggled to find a single driving instructor willing to take her for her test, forcing her to turn to Facebook in desperation. I was determined I would pass my driving test the second time - I simply needed to optimise my chances. A quick Google search told me where I needed to go, the Isle of Mull. I booked for the earliest available date, in mid-December, she told The Times. For their lessons residents tend to head to Oban on the mainland, where the ferry to the island departs from. None of the instructors I got hold of fancied the trip, each warning me of high chances that my crossing would be cancelled in bad weather. I took to Facebook, where local paramedic Mairi took pity and offered her blue Mini.Constance was feeling confident, especially after learning Mullaposs single roundabout would not feature on her test and there was nowhere to parallel park - not to mention the stunning local scenery which glistened under the winter sun. When they got back onto the mainland, the test instructor told her: I don’t like to talk about people who fail their tests. Think of it as just not passing. Better luck next time, Constance.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Waves reaching up to  metres hit the outer Haaposapia island group, destroying all of the houses on the island of Mango, as well as the west coast of Tongaaposs main island, Tongatapu, the prime ministeraposs office said. In Kanokupolu village on the island of Tongatapu locals have been pictured staring at trees that have been felled, buildings in ruins and everything coated in black ash. James Garvin, chief scientist at NASAaposs Goddard Space Flight Center, said the force of the eruption was estimated to be equivalent to five to  megatons of TNT, an explosive force more than  times the nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. The blast was heard as far away as Alaska and was probably one of the loudest events to occur on Earth in over a century, according to Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.This might be the loudest eruption since [the eruption of the Indonesian volcano] Krakatau in , Poland told NPR. That massive th-century eruption killed thousands and released so much ash that it cast much of the region into darkness. Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haaposapai was completely destroyed by Saturdayaposs explosion, says Dan Slayback, a research scientist for NASAaposs Goddard, as well as Science Systems and Applications Inc. Slayback says the blast was so massive it even appears to have taken chunks out of the older islands nearby. They werenapost ash — they were solid rock, blown to bits, he says. It was quite amazing to see that happen.  With its airport smothered by volcanic ash and communications badly hampered by the severing of an undersea cable, information on the scale of the devastation has mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft. Planes sent from New Zealand show the damage from the air with images of the inundation caused by tsunami on the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.  A dficult humanitarian aid effort is now under way to help the survivors from the disaster. The Red Cross said its teams in Tonga had confirmed that salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash were polluting the drinking water relied on by tens of thousands of people. Securing access to safe drinking water is a critical immediate priority... as there is a mounting risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea, Katie Greenwood, the Pacic head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement.

Rachel told how the girl, who she estimates was aged between six and seven, came in with a headscarf on and showed her the infestation which was the worst Rachel had ever seen. The child was later taken to hospital and needed to have her head shaved. “She was very quiet and showed me how the lice were biting down her neck and back, since there was little to no space for them to crawl freely in her hair,” Rachel said. “Immediately when I saw her I knew something was wrong and that this would be the biggest case of lice I’ve had to face. “I’m used to extreme lice infestations but was definitely not prepared for what I saw. “I was told that the child had been dealing with the lice for several months and that treatments were being applied. “But my professional opinion is that this was an extended lice case where nothing was being done to combat it. The hairdresser said she could tell that the girlaposs hair had not been brushed in months and had tangled into a deep dreadlock matting that would have been impossible to treat with lice solution. This is sadly the result of child neglect,” she continued. It takes a very long time for lice to reach the point of severe infestation. It takes an even longer amount of time for hair to go that matted. In the video, which Rachel shared with her three million followers, the hairdresser films the child’s hair which can be seen crawling with lice. She said: “This poor child has obviously had lice for a very long time. Her hair has not been brushed in ages and has turned into one big ball of lice and knots, which meant that I called Child Protective Services right away.” Showing a clip of her usual method used on a previous client, Rachel wets the hair and applies a conditioning treatment before combing through the hair. Using glass, she “pops” the lice, pressing down to kill them. Sadly, this was not an option for the child and would have been too painful due to the matted condition of her hair. “In usual cases, it’s just a matter of combing through the hair section by section and popping the lice but I didn’t want to put a metal comb anywhere near this poor baby’s hair, Rachel said. “You can even see the lice were drinking blood out of her forehead. This broke my heart to see but I’m really glad she’s okay now.” The post went viral, racking up . million likes and being viewed  million times. One person commented: “Watching her wipe her tears made me have to do the same thing. I’m so sad for her but glad to hear she is safe.” Another user said: “I’m so so thankful that you stood up for her and protected her. Some users commented there was “no excuse” for the girl’s condition, while other people said their heads were itchy after watching the footage. After removing the lice infestation, Rachel updated her followers to explain the child had been picked up by CPS and was taken to hospital. “Although it was not the finished result anyone was hoping for, I know she feels a whole lot better with a fresh start so her scalp can start to heal, she said. Filming the hair for a follow-up post, Rachel explained the child’s hair had been detaching from the scalp. She says: “This left no space for the lice to move anywhere so they had to go on her hands and her neck to drink blood out of her body like that.” “Also there was a smell that leads me to believe there was some kind of mould in the matting here. “It’s very rare I see cases like this but it always breaks my heart.” Rachel also added that the stigma surrounding head lice is a big contributing factor to the spread of lice, as well as a “lack of education” and “embarrassment”.

Temperatures had plummeted to -C when Karim Bouchetata took the photos on Tuesday near the town of Ain Sefra in northwest Algeria yesterday.The area has seen snow before due to it being surrounded by the Atlas Mountains and , metres above sea level.But the phenomenon is still rare as it has seen snow just five times in the last  years - in , ,  and .  The ice created stunning patterns in the sand but there possible wasnapost enough of the white stuff to build a lesize snowman or an igloo. The Sahara Desert covers most of Northern Africa and Ain Sefra is known as ‘The Gateway to the Desert’. The desert has gone through temperature and moisture changes over the past few hundred thousand years, but snow rarely occurs because there is not usually enough water in the air for it despite it being able to get very cold at night.  The desert is much hotter with an average temperature during the day a majority of the time with the mercury hitting C. It has a heat record of more than C. Katim also captured pictures of the Sahara Desert covered in snow in January last year.  Sheep and camels were also seen standing on the snowy dunes as temperatures dipped to -C. In  snow fell in the area that was settled children made snowmen and even sledged on the sand dunes. Two years later the desert was covered in  inches deep snow after a freak winter storm - the second showing of the white stuff for  years. Karim said at the time: We were really surprised when we woke up to see snow again.

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances.

mid-season, but any amendments would require the usual -club majority.The criteria have come under much scrutiny, with Tottenham critical of the Premier League board’s decision to postpone last

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll ranked one of the most peaceful locations in britain","story":"With demand for rural retreats rising and more people looking to escape the typical tourist hotspots for a tranquil break, holiday provider Cottages in Northumberland carried out research to find the top places to find peace and quiet in England, Scotland and Wales.Thinking about what makes an area quiet – no people, no noise, no light pollution and lots of nature and wildle – Cottages in Northumberland pulled together data covering population count, National Park counts and Dark Sky sites.This data was then ranked to reveal the UK#s quietest areas as follows:  Powys, Wales  Northumberland, England  The Highlands, Scotland  Argyll and Bute, Scotland  Morayshire, Scotland  North Yorkshire, England  Pembrokeshire, Wales  Cumbria, England  Aberdeenshire, Scotland  Devon, England.Just missing out on a podium spot, Argyll and Bute ranked highly thanks to the area#s low population count of  people per square kilometre, which is actually the third lowest count in the UK overall, following the Scottish Highlands and Western Isles.Being home to Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park and the internationally recognised Isle of Coll Dark-Sky Community also helped boost Argyll and Bute#s position.The only Scottish location to rank higher was the Highlands which came third in the overall rankings.Having the lowest population count in the whole of the UK, with a mere nine people per square kilometre, helped to elevate the Highlands into the bronze position.It also home to the Cairngorms National Park which is a centre for outdoor activity, with mountains, lochs, woodland forests and rivers, as well as small local villages which are lovely to explore.And whilst the Highlands does not have an internationally recognised Dark Sky park, it does have  Milky Way sites, ranking it second in the UK for Dark Sky sites.In second place, Northumberland was deemed England#s quietest place.The coastal county, which houses Northumberland National Park, has a low population count of  people per square kilometre.It is also well known for its stargazing potential, boasting one Dark Sky Orion site and  Milky Way sites – more sites than anywhere  in the UK.And taking the top spot, Powys in Wales was officially crowned the best place for peace and quiet in Great Britain.With a population count of  people per square kilometre, and home to the Brecon Beacons National Park where there are endless woodlands, waterfalls, hills, moorlands, and heritage sites to explore, Powys is undoubtedly a place of peace and serenity."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

However, since eToro is available through a desktop site and mobile app, this is one of the speediest and most user-friendly brokerage sites in the business. As for the benefits of using eToro compared with some of the other exchanges, there are some fairly obvious advantages. First and foremost, eToro is one of the few sites that facilitates social trading - a major competitive advantage. Social trading is an activity where you can essentially copy the trades of other, more seasoned investors, and therefore you get to copy their investment performance. This has proved to be very popular among younger investors. In addition to this, eToro has zero fees for crypto transactions, which not many exchanges can boast.

There is a fairly standard process required to open an online investment account, and in terms of personal requirements, you must be over the legal investing age and be a resident of a crypto-supported country. Providing that you satisfy these criteria, you can set yourself up with a new trading account by running through the following:The Registration ProcessFirst thing’s first, you have to actually create your online account before you can invest in any cryptos at all. This is required at all exchange s, in accordance with FCA, ASIC, and FINRAregulations. So, once you’ve decided which exchange site you’d like to joinyou must create a fresh username and password for that site. Your username has to be unique, and the password must be strong so that it cannot be hacked into easily. From here, it’s time to supply the site with your personal details. In order for the site to very that you are legally allowed to trade crypto, you must provide your name, DOB, address, contact information, and title. Once these details have been shared, you can then set up any security questions that you wish to implement for your account.

Note that anyone could actually go ahead and open an account, but in order to enjoy unrestricted access to all products and services, your details must be veried. Some people assume that this is a complex and slow process, but we can assure you that this isn’t true. While you are signed in, you can head into your account profile where you should see a link to very your details. On that note, there are two things that the site needs to confirm - that you are resident in your stated country and that you are over the legal investing age.So, concerning ID verication, you are usually able to scan or upload a photo of either your driving license or passport. Since these documents have both your name and date of birth on them, this takes care of proving who you are. But in addition to this, you must then demonstrate that you are a legal resident, by proving your address. In order to do this, you can upload either a bank statement or utility bill, which usually needs to be a recent document .After you have submitted this information, your account should get veried within a few hours.Depositing FundsCrypto coins might be classied as digital assets, but your very first purchase of a crypto coin must be executed in fiat currency. This describes currencies that are legal tender in regulated countries, such as GBP, AUD, EUR, and USD . And in order to deposit some fiat into your account, you can choose between a range of supported payment methods on our recommended exchanges. In terms of the main methods, you’ll typically find a selection of the following:Making Your First Crypto PurchaseWith funds deposited into your account, you can start to browse through the list of coins that each  has available.

After all, anyone could shortlist a range of investment s and claim them to be the best. But that leaves users somewhat in the dark as they approach the decision as to where they invest. To avoid that, we’d like to highlight some key areas that you must look at before signing up with any exchange.User ExperiencePutting the actual range of products or cryptos aside for a moment, the user experience is often an overlooked area.

After all, you could sign up with the best crypto exchange in the world, butit is overly complex or dficult to use, your ultimate experience will not be satisfactory.Payment MethodsSome might also involve fees, which is why you must assess each of these things prior to processing a deposit or withdrawal.FeesFees can be charged by crypto exchanges for ious things. Of course, each of these fees takes money out of your account, and subsequently reduces the capital you have available for investing. In terms of what areas fees apply to, you could see fees for deposits, withdrawals, trades, and even for inactivity at some s. With that said, there are s out there that have all but eliminated fees for several of these areas. And the more you can reduce your fees, the more cash you’ll keep to invest.RegulationCrypto is a regulated market in many parts of the world, meaning that it is officially legal to buy and sell ious coins within certain borders. In this sense, you’ve not got much to worry about when it comes to the market as a whole. However, inidual coins certainly can fall victim to regulations in dferent countries around the world. Take XRP as a prime example - the Ripple project is still facing a legal battle against the SEC in the US, which has greatly impacted the price.Range of CryptosMuch like the range of payment methods discussed above, the more cryptos that a site has available, the better things are doing to be. After all, there is nothing more frustrating than identying a potentially great investment only to find that your chosen site doesn’t support it. But while an exchange might actually support your preferred crypto, you still need to identy what trading pairs are available for that specic coin.  gtgtgt Visit eToro here to get started ltltlt % of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerFinal ThoughtsWhen all is said and done, crypto exchanges are safe and reputable s that can be used to buy and sell ious crypto coins.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC. However, there has been no lack of discussions over the years. What we need to see is agreement reached, procurement started and vessels delivered.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The cost of the bid was £million.Simon Hodge, chief executive of Crown Estate Scotland, said: #Today’s results are a fantastic vote of confidence in Scotland’s ability to transform our energy sector. Just a couple of months after hosting COP, we’ve now taken a major step towards powering our future economy with renewable electricity.“In addition to the environmental benefits, this also represents a major investment in the Scottish economy, with around £m being delivered straight into the public finances and billions of pounds worth of supply chain commitments.#The iety and scale of the projects that will progress onto the next stages shows both the remarkable progress of the offshore wind sector, and a clear sign that Scotland is set to be a major hub for the further development of this technology in the years to come.#More on this story in this week#s The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

However, no progress has been made.A petition calling on the council to take action and restore Wilmont House to its former glory has been signed by more than  people so far.It was launched by local woman Sharon Marks, who said she had noticed the poor state of the building while taking walks in Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park during lockdown.“About a year ago, I contacted the council to see what the plans for the building were as it was gted to the council and the people of Belfast,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “For such a beautul building to fall into such a state of disrepair is just so sad. “The council said it was planning on carrying out an expression-of-interest exercise in early  to find someone to bring it back into use, but the pandemic has delayed this. “That really hacked me off, so I got in contact with local politicians to bring things forward, but that didn’t get very far.“One or two people in the council shouldn’t be gatekeepers of Wilmont House. “It was gted to the council and all the people of Belfast. People should be able to enjoy it.“It is such a beautul building and for that amount of heritage and history to be lost would be terrible.”Donal Lyons, a member of Belfast City Council’s growth and regeneration committee, agreed action should be taken.“There’s not many buildings like Wilmont House left in Belfast, let alone ones in such a setting, and we need to ensure that they are protected for future generations,” he said. “We’re lucky to have them. Each one of them captures a moment in the city’s history and everyone has their own personal stories in which these beautul buildings play a role. “We need to do more than just let them sit in decay.”A spokesperson for the council said: “Wilmont House at Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park is a Grade B-plus listed building owned by Belfast City Council. “We are in the process of preparing an invitation for expressions of interest to go to the market later this year, seeking a suitably qualied developer to restore the building and bring it into a new use.”Wilmont House, which dates back to , served as the headquarters of the US Army in Northern Ireland during the Second World War. It was later used as a nursing home and a parks office for the council. At one stage, it was also the headquarters of the Belfast Marathon. The petition calling on the council to restore Wilmont House can be found at change.orgRelated topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelRegister for animal cruelty offenders is a step closer, says Poots PremiumJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fund PremiumViewpointOpinionIt’s worth travelling along green routeBelfast councillors to discuss motion on free public transport for young peopleMost ReadDUP councillor Audrey Wales’ spend on clothes during year as mayor causes further controversy‘Horric murder of Reavey brothers is story I was born to tell’: NI director on making a movie about death of his three uncles in What should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Antrim council gave taskforce boss Rose Mary Stalker over £k for  days’ workMan found guilty of threatening to kill Jamie BrysonTop VideosPlayWatch: ‘In the name of God, go’, David Davis tells Boris Johnson in fiery Commons PMQs sessionPlayGovernment to withdraw ‘double-jobbing’ amendment, says PMBrian Smith appeared at Newtonards court on Tuesday.A north Belfast was todayconvicted of threatening to kill loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.Following a brief contest at Newtownards Magistrates Court, -year-old Brian Smith was also convicted of harassing Mr Bryson and making a threat that he would petrol bomb the homes of the victims mother and partner, all committed between July -

It cannot be dominated by the chaos of the early response,” he said.

It was agreed members would consider the scope of the motion to open discussion up across all communities in the district, aspire to make the proposed consultation process as inclusive as possible, and carry out consultation.At a meeting on November , members agreed to seek professional support to help implement the motion and secure quotations from suitably qualied providers.It is understood quotations will be sought in February with workshops being delivered this spring.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up With regards to the cost, officers believe £, will be required from the council which will be met from within existing budgets resources.The report explained the £, will be broken down into a £, management fee and a workshop promotion and delivery budget that could see £, spent on speaker costs £, spent on PR and marketing costs and £, spent on digital set-up.The report also noted a preliminary equality screening has been carried out by the corporate policy and equality officer and a full screening will be developed before seeking a quotation for the workshop.Councillor Paul McLean said the DUP is opposed to the motion and said that “in today’s climate, £, could be better spent”.Ulster Unionist group leader, Councillor Walter Cuddy said he “totally agreed” with Mr McLean and questioned the work of the good relations working group.“There has been so much money lost to this council through Covid and we are trying to cover the gaps and provide services to the ratepayers which we have not always been able to do,” he said.“Now, as we approach the striking of the rates, we will probably be looking to increase them again. Any ratepayer this past year will note facilities have been closed and a lot of services have not been provided. People will be thinking why should I be paying extra, then they see something like this.“As a party we don’t attend the good relations working group, there is no benefit to us in it and yet it is the forum that decides what we do on this topic.“Should somebody on the good relations working group not be askingbringing an issue like this forward at this time could impact good relations  Nowhere within the report can I see an officer or anybody ask this question.“I am just so disappointed that we can spend our ratepayers’ hard-earned money on this. The UUP has no confidence in the whole process and will not have anything to do with it.”Most ReadDUP councillor Audrey Wales’ spend on clothes during year as mayor causes further controversy‘Horric murder of Reavey brothers is story I was born to tell’: NI director on making a movie about death of his three uncles in What should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Antrim council gave taskforce boss Rose Mary Stalker over £k for  days’ workMan found guilty of threatening to kill Jamie BrysonTop VideosPlayWatch: ‘In the name of God, go’, David Davis tells Boris Johnson in fiery Commons PMQs sessionPlayGovernment to withdraw ‘double-jobbing’ amendment, says PMBrian Smith appeared at Newtonards court on Tuesday.A north Belfast was todayconvicted of threatening to kill loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.Following a brief contest at Newtownards Magistrates Court, -year-old Brian Smith was also convicted of harassing Mr Bryson and making a threat that he would petrol bomb the homes of the victims mother and partner, all committed between July -

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses.

Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

They are drawn from our century-and-half of operational work, and the lived experiences of those we work with today.We believe adopting these priorities will help to ensure people in crisis get the support they need no matter who or where they are.They are not only achievable, they are essential, and we urge all parties and candidates to incorporate them into their planning for the year ahead and beyond.A world where everyone gets the help they need in a crisis is within our reach onlywe choose it to be.l Sharon Sinclair is area director for British Red Cross, Northern IrelandThe publication British Red Cross Policy Priorities for the next Northern Ireland Executive is available on our website at: www.redcross.org.uk about-us what-we-do we-speak-up-for-change british-red-cross-policy-priorities-for-the-next-northern-ireland-executiveMore from the News Letter:Click here – VIDEO: Huge revamp of Belfast would create miles-long leafy avenue... turn Westlink into tunnel... and make city ‘blue again’ Click here – Wall of silence: Home Office suggests it is dangerous to tell public details about turning Carrickfergus hotel into base for foreign nationals Click here – Criminalising conversion therapy: Northern Ireland must avoid – not mimic – Canada’s new law says transgender writerA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And evenit was, the public could have misread such remarks as meaning they were in great danger, when it became apparent late last month that omicron was having a minor health impact. However, it is welcome to hear Dr Black now speak in a reassuring way, and admit that “our worst expectations haven’t been reached”. The covid crisis is not yet over – there have been too many twists and turns so far to be sure of any scenarios in the near future – but it is at a sufficiently mild level where we cannot tolerate the ruin of certain livelihoods and groups of people.Most society leaders — medical, scientic and political —who have demanded rigid controls are themselves financially untouched by lockdown because they are paid by the state.If lockdown does , the financial burden should be more evenly spread so that there is extra money for sectors such as hospitality.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a report, entitled A UBI Pilot for Wales, the Petitions Committee concluded the current scheme for care leavers “has merit”, but that a wider trial would allow policymakers to learn more about the impact of a UBI.Universal Basic Income is the idea a government should pay all iniduals a set salary, regardless of their means.Last year, the country’s Labour government said it wanted to pilot such a scheme targeting  care leavers by giving them an additional sum of money each month.Proponents of the plans included those who believe UBI should apply to all citizens, and a petition submitted in August  calling for an expansion of the pilot gained over a thousands signatures.The committee, led by chair Jack Sargeant MS, invited a number of experts including Sophie Howe, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Will Stronge, director of research at think tank Autonomy, Lydia Godden, Women’s Equality NetworkWales, and Ewan Hilton, CEO of mental health charity Platfform to give evidence on the topic.They concluded the government should consider increasing the size and ersity of the pilot scheme to provide more robust data, and ensure payments are guaranteed, unconditional, and paid to the inidual, not the household.It has also recommended the government make every effort to persuade UK Government departments such as the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to support the widest possible pilot scheme.While they said the pilot should be conducted by independent experts, include a control group and attempt to capture any indirect savings or costs that accrue as a result of the pilot.Mr Sergeant said: “It’s clear from the evidence presented to us that broadening the pilot could have huge benefits.“The Welsh Government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as erse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme..remove“While not all Members of the Committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh Government to consider.“I would like to extend my thanks to the petitioners whose passion for tackling poverty shone through and should be commended, as well as all those who signed the petition.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

All volunteers receive regular training and are all vetted through Access NI to ensure their suitability to work with children and young people.“Families get involved in using our centre through the service of a solicitor, family court, or Social Services.”In Northern Ireland, contact centres utilise church halls and similar facilities to facilitate contact sessions. “During the pandemic, the Carrickfergus centre only closed for the first lockdown, and has managed to maintain direct contact for all of our families since June,” Shelly added. “During the lockdown period, indirect contact was maintained for families via our own Zoom facilities, enabling separated families to maintain much needed contact with each other.”Shelly is now hoping to expand the centre to bigger, better facilities, extending availability from limited hours to a six days a week service.The service is relocating to West Street in Carrickfergus town centre.Sensory room also for public useAdditionally, she envisaged the development of a ‘sensory room’, professionally designed and installed, free for public use for families with children who might benefit.Shelly and the centre’s chairperson, Tony Barclay, embarked upon a development project to identy potential costs, location and feasibility of the proposals. In October , whilst researching potential premises,  West Street was identied as a potential option. A former butcher’s shop, the unit had been completely redesigned as offices, a project which had stopped during the pandemic.The trustees of the charity agreed that the project should commence, and a lease for  West Street was signed. Within the centre, facilities are being developed to accommodate children of all ages from birth to  years, including an open play area for younger children a private, secluded room for older children, and – uniquely in any contact centre in NI – a professionally designed and installed sensory room, to be made available not only to service users of the contact centre, but also to other charities working with children who would benefit. The sensory room is also to be made publicly available to any family whose children would benefit from it, at no cost to the family.“We anticipate opening the centre and its facilities in February , once the full fit out is completed,” Shelly said.“We anticipate the sensory room will also open and become publicly available around the same time, bookable for -minute sessions for single families. A booking system is being developed for this purpose. “Our research has identied the existence of other sensory rooms in schools and other facilities across NI, but none which are available publicly – we believe this is the first.”Superb support from local communityThe Contact Centre is partly funded by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and partly by charitable grants.So far, staff have secured £, of funding specically towards the development of the sensory room, although another £, is needed to complete it, including lighting, soft flooring and soundproofing the walls.\"The local community, businesses and iniduals have been superb in supporting us as we move forward, including builders merchants providing materials, the local community coming together to provide equipment, and iniduals providing their own support,\" Shelly continued.\"We have been especially blessed in the form of local resident and businessman Gary Connolly, who has provided a great deal of time and personal effort to build the walls within the new centre, including the Sensory Room, free of charge to us.\"In order to complete the new centre, we need to raise more funds, and furnish the centre with equipment suitable for the families we support. As a registered charity, we provide all of ourservices free of charge to our service users. As well as needing to raise £, to complete the sensory room, we need durable flooring, baby change facilities, accessible toilet handles emergency call system, fire extinguishers, a secure door access system, a small CCTV system, and more.\"We greatly appreciate all the help the local community has offered, as well as the support from the Law Society of NI, who have fully endorsed and are supporting the development of the new centre, which will offer so much to the local community – and possibly much further afield.\"Meanwhile, waiting times for access to a contact centre will be reduced, and possibly even eliminated, with the planned six day opening. \"Families with special needs, including wheelchairusers and those with sensitive children of all ages, will have the opportunity to access a centre designed to meet those needs.\"The fit out of the new premises is already underway. There is still much to do in order to be ready for opening day in February. The charity welcome any and all support, in terms of funding to help us achieve our goals including the sensory room, to provide furniture and toys for all ages from - , and to finish the fit out.\"Shelly McCord can be contacted by email at [email#protected], or by phone at  , while Tony Barclay can be contacted at [email#protected] or by phone at  .CarrickfergusWest StreetNorthern IrelandYMCA  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularNew Carrickfergus ‘link’ road given green light by Mid and E...News attacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime teenage-boy--attacked-by-gang-in-craigavon-co-armagh- itm_sourceparsely-api\" attacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh\" \"\" width\"\" attacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime teenage-boy--attacked-by-gang-in-craigavon-co-armagh- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Teenage boyattacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh...NewsJaguar E-Pace stolen from Portadown home...News arrested as police investigate a series of burglaries in Newtownabbey\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-as-police-investigate-a-series-of-burglaries-in-newtownabbey- itm_sourceparsely-api\" arrested as police investigate a series of burglaries in Newtownabbey\" \"\" width\"\" arrested as police investigate a series of burglaries in Newtownabbey\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-as-police-investigate-a-series-of-burglaries-in-newtownabbey- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Manarrested as police investigate a series of burglari...NewsLotto luck hits Tyrone as £ flutter bags £, profit...NewsMost PopularHome office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have w...RecommendedSmart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home sa...RecommendedHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router ext...RecommendedBest pancake pans UK: from non-stick to cast iron, these pan...RecommendedHome exercise gear that works: weighted hula-hoops, bala ban...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?164206751200","title":"take part in this year s big garden birdwatch ","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.
