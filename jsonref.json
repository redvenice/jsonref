Rusty said Angel saw the post and said: \u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027           In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Rusty Updegraff claims the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would leave town for ten days at a time and not call her children. He says seeing the emotional impact her behavior was having on Angel and even Phoenix, 19, spurred him to actJudge Mark Juhas imposed the strict regulations while he works out what to do over long term custody with her ex Belafonte.The order says Mel can, \u0027hire an acceptable nanny from a registered and bonded agency\u0027 to satisfy the requirement, but there must be someone \u0027present\u0027 so that the star is not left alone with her child unsupervised.Restaurateur Rusty says he is pleased with the outcome and it was never his intention to push for Mel to lose custody of her children.\u0027I did the job, you know, because it\u0027s about the kids, not about her,\u0027 he said.\u0027Those girls love their mom and Melanie loves the girls, but Melanie desperately needs help.\u0027I want her to be clean and healthy, because when she\u0027s healthy she can be a mom again. Right now she\u0027s the world\u0027s worst mom.\u0027Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.And during the shouting matches the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would often hit out at sports mad Angel calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant.He recalls: \u0027Angel\u0027s a tomboy, she doesn\u0027t like to shower, she\u0027s at that age, so Mel nicknames her smelly b***h, she\u0027s like, \u0027you want to be a smelly b***h? Everybody will call you smelly b***h\u0027 and she\u0027d just keep going.\u0027I pleaded with her, \u0027\u0027please don\u0027t say that to your daughter\u0027\u0027. She responded: \u0027\u0027Why? She is a smelly b***h… she stinks.\u0027\u0027\u0027Angel is 11 years old, that\u0027s going to stay with her, I know because my dad was like that...it just creates these insecurities in children as they get older.\u0027          Rusty claims that the singer cruelly bullied her 11-year-old daughter Angel (pictured together), calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant          Updegraff filed the bombshell deposition in regards to the America\u0027s Got Talent judge after witnessing her behavior while he was looking after her young children for nine months          Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot. Pictured: Mel B with Angel (left), Madison (center) and Phoenix, 19, (right) on Mother\u0027s Day           Updegraff shared texts messages he received from Mel B\u0027s best friend Charlotte, who tried to stage an intervention with the singer, which lists her numerous partners          The screenshots Updegraff provided also reveal an enormous tower of tequila boxes stockpiled in Mel B\u0027s homeOn another occasion one of the star\u0027s Instagram posts got the attention of Angel.Mel posed naked with hairdresser and BFF Gary Madatyan, who was also naked, in a swimming pool and posted the provocative photos on her social media feed.Rusty, 60, recalls the shocking moment Mel\u0027s daughter spotted the post.\u0027We were in Palm Springs and Mel had been drinking. I was on my last nerve and Mel had been on a roll in LA before she even went to Palm Springs.\u0027Then Angel saw an Instagram post of Melanie naked with Gary her hairdresser and she\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027\u0027\u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad.\u0027Angel was embarrassed that Mommy had done this. Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/21/50246D7800000578-0-image-m-42_1536869720355.jpg","title":"Hurricane Florence storms hurricanes names","story":"In terms of the hurricane’s financial toll, officials have already predicted that a staggering $30 billion (£23b) in damages could result from it, potentially making Hurricane Florence one of the most expensive storms in U.S. history.The National Hurricane Center expects the storm to become ‘an extremely dangerous major hurricane’ on September 13 while 1.5 million people have already been ordered to evacuate.

That\u0027s a clue..\u0027The actresses, both staunch Democrats, supported different candidates for the 2016 election, with Sarandon supporting Bernie Sanders, and Messing putting her weight behind Hillary Clinton.The feud began when Sarandon, asked by MSNBC\u0027s Chris Hayes who she would vote for if Sanders lost the nomination, said \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m going to see what happens\u0027.Some believed that she was saying she wouldn\u0027t vote at all, or even that she would vote for Trump.           After reading the interview, Messing tweeted: \u0027Susan Sarandon muses that Trump presidency would be better for the country than Hillary. Wonder if she\u0027d say that if she were poor, gay, Muslim or an immigrant.\u0027Sarandon responded: \u0027Watch the interview. Don\u0027t just read the headlines. #Spin.\u0027 She also clarified that she never said she had even considered voting for Trump.\u0027LOL that I would ever vote Trump,\u0027 Sarandon tweeted.The pair then went back and forth on Twitter, with Susan accusing her rival of \u0027RT-ing personal attacks\u0027 against her before finally finishing the exchange by tweeting: \u0027Alright @DebraMessing report me to the homeroom teacher and let\u0027s STOP.\u0027Messing later admitted that she \u0027became a big mouth on Twitter\u0027 while passionately campaigning for Clinton last year. Their feud was revisited last year when Andy Cohen asked socialist Sarandon about the incident during an appearance on his talk show in May.\u0027You know, I think she\u0027s not very well informed, so sometimes she gets in areas that she really hasn’t thought through,\u0027 said Susan.    Uncertain: The actress started a firestorm on Monday, when she told MSNBC\u0027s Chris Hayes she didn\u0027t know how she would vote if the general election came down to Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton           Misunderstood: The actress, who is a supporter of Bernie Sanders, clarified that she never said she would vote for Trump, like some inferred - including fellow actress Debra Messing \u0027She’s Trumpian a little bit like that, so I don’t have anything against her personally.\u0027I just sometimes I have to say, ‘But you don’t have the information.\u0027In Saradon\u0027s latest interview, the Thelma and Louise star, who has been critical of how the Democratic party has been run, said that she wasn\u0027t a fan of Trump\u0027s presidency but that the only positive thing was that \u0027unintentionally, he has energized\u0027 young Democrats.\u0027He was so bumbling, he\u0027s like a character from a cartoon,\u0027 said Sarandon, saying that Trump\u0027s ineptitude had highlighted other issues that had been a problem for a long time, such as deportations and Democrats losing seats.She said that so many more women and people of color were in the primaries and running for governor than ever before. \u0027The cracks are where the light comes through,\u0027 she said, quoting Leonard Cohen."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/09/501E335F00000578-6163037-image-a-4_1536828179998.jpg","title":"Lion looks sheepish appears telling mating lioness","story":"    The dramatic photographs show the lioness roaring at the king of the jungle who looks shocked at her obvious displeasure          The lion and lioness were captured having a sexual encounter in the Massai Mara before the lion receives a telling off          Following their mating session the lioness roars in fury at her male counterpart in a state of frustration and rage  Clearly caught off guard the lion stares at her with a sheepish look and cowers in fear in a state of shock          The lion still looks in shock after the animals have stopped roaring at one another This is not the first time a lion has been on the receiving end of a furious lioness. In January, George Hart captured an angry lioness roaring into the face of the lion in the Central Serengeti, Tanzania during his first ever African safari.The lion was spotted cowering away in fear and covering his face with his paw during the fierce lovers\u0027 tiff.In July, game reserve manager, Giuseppe D\u0027amico, spotted an enraged lioness slapping her partner across the face on the green plains of Tanzania in the Ndutu area.The fighting pair were also seen baring their teeth at each other during the domestic dispute.   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/17/5022666A00000578-6163063-image-a-193_1536856517309.jpg","title":"Prince Harry meets Royal Marine recruits Captain General","story":"The Duke of Sussex is presented with the Sword of honour by Major General Charlie Stickland OBE          Harry larked about with the Invictus Games Racing team\u0027s fleet of cars, including this miniature model           The Duke of Sussex became Captain General Royal Marines in December 2017 and assumed the role in succession to his grandfather The Duke of Edinburgh, who was Captain General for some 64 years          Harry met with William Prosser and his father, Afghan veteran and Royal Marine Kieran Prosser - who was this year part of a \u0027handpicked\u0027 team to take the England football squad through a tough training weekend to instil \u0027Commando Spirit\u0027          Prince Harry got into the spirit of things in the training centre and helped put young new recruits through their paces The Duke watched recruits being put through their paces on a rope course above a freezing tank of water, and saw a number haul themselves out dripping after falling in. Harry, a former Army captain who served in the forces for 10 years, added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be blood, sweat and tears.\u0027Every single time you end up going to bed where you\u0027re crying, or got a sore leg, or an emotional issue to have to deal with - but it is without doubt probably one of the best professions you can ever be involved with.From the Bridge Climb to camping at Fraser Island: The...The Peckish Prince!

That is what we must do.\u0027 At a rally in 2006, Mr Murray read out a message sent to him by Ali Fayad, a Ukrainian arms dealer and senior Hezbollah terror chief, who was jailed in 2014 in the US for funding terror          People at the rally (pictured, which before Mr Fayad was convicted, carried banners saying \u0027victory to the intifada\u0027 and \u0027we are all Hezbollah\u0027 and waved the communist flag          Mr Corbyn has come under intense pressure since it was revealed that two of his closest aides have been working in Parliament for months without security clearance and faces a probeIn a report on the 2006 march, where 20,000 people are said to have attended, the Socialist party newspaper wrote: \u0027Left-wing leading members of the Stop the War Coalition, including George Galloway and Andrew Murray, not only failed to raise socialist ideas but also expressed uncritical support for the Islamist Hamas and Hezbollah.\u0027 A speech was also made by activist and long-term Corbyn ally Azzam Tamimi, who said he wanted to blow himself up in a suicide attack. \u0027Sacrificing myself for Palestine is a noble cause,\u0027 he told the BBC. \u0027It is the straight way to pleasing my God and I would do it if I had the opportunity.\u0027 Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Shia militia in Lebanon that was set up in the early 1980s. Its followers use the Hitler salute and has carried out terror attacks against Jews both in Israel and worldwide. Britain views its military wing as a terrorist entity. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, told MailOnline: \u0027Make no mistake, Hezbollah is actively planning attacks around the world, including in Europe and in the UK. \u0027It is no surprising that a Corbyn ally has these sympathies. After all, Corbyn himself called Hezbollah his friends a few years ago. \u0027To have supporters in the heart of our democracy will give the terrorists great encouragement. It is deeply worrying and it must be stopped.\u0027 Mr Corbyn is facing a probe over claims that a second aide has also been working in Parliament without security clearance.His Private Secretary, Iram Awan, a British-born pro-Palestinian activist was not granted full security passes but continued to work for the Labour leader in Parliament for nine months using a visitor\u0027s pass.Mr Corbyn is under intense pressure because every staffer in Parliament requires a Commons pass and is required to undergo a counter-terrorist check (CTC) into their background and associates. Mr Murray is the grandson of a Tory MP and was educated at a £32,000-a-year public school. He  appears in Debrett\u0027s Peerage, the guide to Britain\u0027s aristocracy. His full moniker is Andrew Drummond-Murray of Mastrick.His father, Peter Drummond-Murray of Mastrick, was a banker and stockbroker from an old Scottish family. His mother, Barbara, was the daughter of Lord Rankeillour, a Conservative MP who later became Governor of Madras in India.            Corbyn\u0027s Private Secretary Iram Awan (pictured with Corbyn), a British-born national, has also been working, this time for nine months, in Parliament using a visitor\u0027s pass, which is against the rulesMr Murray was a member of Britain\u0027s communist party until 2016 and has praised Stalin and North Korea. On one occasion, he reportedly said: \u0027Against imperialists, we are all Stalinists\u0027. On another, he pledged \u0027solidarity\u0027 with the North Korean regime. It normally takes a matter of weeks for Parliamentary passes to be processed. However, Mr Murray and Miss Awan have not yet had their application approved despite taking up the role with the Labour leader many months ago. Commons authorities are now investigating whether Parliamentary rules have been broken by Mr Corbyn\u0027s office in allowing them to work in Parliament. Tory MPs have also written to the Serjeant-at-Arms, who is responsible for order and security in the Commons, to demand he also investigates the affair. Tory Party chairman Brandon Lewis said last night: \u0027This clear breach of security not only puts Parliament at risk, it also raises serious questions about Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s judgment and integrity.\u0027 Tory MP Leo Docherty added: \u0027We all know how the security of Parliament is a matter of the utmost importance and Jeremy Corbyn has put this at risk.\u0027 Commons authorities were facing questions last night about the apparent breach of basic security rules.A Labour spokesman said: \u0027We do not comment on staffing matters.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/11/0336BCEA00000BB8-6163481-image-a-46_1536834517254.jpg","title":"When Oktoberfest need know","story":"    Revellers try to snatch free beer at the Hofbraeu tent on the opening day of 2015 OktoberfestWhat is Oktoberfest?According to Time, Oktoberfest began when Bavaria’s Crown Prince Ludwig married Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen on October 12, 1810. The day was celebrated by all the citizens who were invited with many days of drinking, feasting and horse races.Bustle reported that despite starting in October, the celebrations were moved to an earlier date so that it could be celebrated in better weather conditions. Now, starting in September, the last weekend is still usually held in October.Oktoberfest was actually a non-alcoholic event at first and what is now the largest beer drinking festival in the world, did not serve alcohol at the festival itself, but was sold outside the fairgrounds. Now, over 7.5 million litres of beer are consumed every year.The 16-day event is opened by the Mayor of Munich who taps the first keg and declares ‘O’ zapft is!’, which can be roughly translated to ‘it’s tapped’ in English. The first person that drinks is traditionally the Minister-President of the State of Bavaria and only after that, visitors can celebrate.Alongside beer, gingerbread cookies with sweet messages called Lebkuchen hearts are also consumed.           Munich\u0027s deputy mayor Josef Schmid poses for  Oktoberfest 2016 with a Lebkuchen heartThe Telegraph reported that in the past 10 years, Oktoberfest has attracted around six million visitors a year, who all make their way through thousands of sausages, chickens and pretzels.In addition to the drinking and feasting, parades are held alongside a number of fairground rides with many dressing traditional Bavarian garb. With the event being so popular, it is advised that attendees book accommodation and transport are booked well in advance on this website.Oktoberfest 2018Oktoberfest 2018 will start on Saturday, September 22 and go on until October 7, according to Munich’s official event website. While entry to the tents is free, visitors will have to pay for beer, fairground attractions and whatever they purchase at the stalls.Die WiesnThe Munich locals refer to Oktoberfest as ‘die Wiesn’ because of its location, Theresienwiese, which was named after the Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen.The highlight of this event is the Costume and Riflemen’s Parade, which happens on the first Wiesn Sunday every year. In 2018, it will be held on Sunday, September 23 and on the following Sunday, an open-air big band concert is held.Other events include the Parade of Oktoberfest Landlords and Breweries, the Oktoberfest Mass or the Böllerschießen, which is a handheld cannon salute in front of the Bavaria statue.          Kim Kardashian visits the Oktoberfest 2010 at the Hippodrom tent at TheresienwieseOktoberfest MunichTheresienwiese is located a short tram ride away from Munich and is celebrated in a number of tents, as Ludwig and Therese did in 1810. However, the tents that are used today have colourful facades, long wooden tables and benches, holding up to 10,000 visitors.About 70 percent of these visitors are from Bavaria itself and 15 percent from other parts of Germany, but there are a large number of people from abroad also, who tend to be found at the Hofbräu tent.Visitors are also encouraged to visit the other 13 tents, such as the Hackerbräu, which is decked out in Bavarian blue and white and the Winzerer Fähndl, that has its own beer garden.The Augustiner Festhalle is popular with families, particularly on Tuesdays and the largest tent is the 10,000-seater Schottenhamel, where the first beer of the season is poured. The smallest is the Glöckle Wirt, which has room for just 98 people and its walls are covered with traditional instruments, cooking utensils and paintings.Oktoberfest outfitsMany opt to wear lederhosen or dirndl, the traditional Bavarian dress with full skirt, apron and tight bodice. However, many have called into question whether or not ‘sexy’ versions of the dirndl should be worn and if this is cultural appropriation, as reported by The Guardian.Oktoberfest beerOktoberfest regulation states that only beer from Munich’s six breweries: Paulaner, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, Augustiner, Hofbräu, and Löwenbräu can be served and like other German brews, Oktoberfest beers must pass the ‘purity’ law, or Reinheitsgebot, passed in 1516 to ensure quality.Oktoberfest beer is served in one-litre glasses and is priced at around  10 Euros. For those who are not partial to beer, there is also a wine tent called the Weinzelt, where visitors can choose from more than 15 different variations.Cynthia Nixon\u0027s net worth revealed as she battles Cuomo for New York governorIs Game of Thrones star Kit Harington replacing Ben Affleck as Batman?Lil Wayne now owns Young MoneyKanye West and Lil Pump spark I Love It dance challenge after track reveal at PornHub Awards New BTS album to be released in Japan this November How to download iOS 12 before Apple officially release the updateK-pop stars HyunA and E\u0027Dawn kicked off Cube Entertainment label after announcing they\u0027re datingLondon Fashion Week 2018: All you need to knowMercury Prize 2018: Hosts and performers revealed for the Hyundai Mercury Prize Award ceremonyWho is Norm Macdonald?

Around a third (34 per cent) of 18 to 24 year-olds were smokers in 2000, but this fell to 23 per cent in 2017.Tory infighting escalates as \u0027new generation\u0027 of MPs demands...Share this articleThe dramatic decline has coincided with the ban on smoking indoors, which came into force in July 2007, and the rise of electronic cigarettes which some people use to try to kick the habit.Although the downward trend has undergone a sudden reversal in the past year - increasing from 18 per cent in 2016 to 23 per cent last year. The sudden uptick comes amid warnings that some young people are being lured into smoking by electronic cigarettes - which come in a variety of fruity flavours.The revelations come as the American authorities announced they could ban the sale of fruity e cigarette flavours in a bid to stop the devices appealing to youngsters.Today\u0027s ONS figures also show that 18 year-olds spend less time socialising and having fun with their friends than they used to.In the year 2000, 18 year-olds spent on average nearly an hour and a half (88 minutes) hanging out with their friends.But this has fallen to just over an hour (61 minutes) in the year 2015, the figures show.           The ONS said that youngsters are spending more time glued to their screens or playing computer games than they used to, and less time socialising with their friends Rather than getting out of the house and socialising, 18 year-olds are spending far more time glued to their computer screans.So, while in 2000 they spent on average 12 minutes a day \u0027computing\u0027  this has grown massively to nearly 29 minutes in 2015.And while 18 year-olds used to just spend 11 minutes a day on \u0027games and computer games\u0027 this has soared to nearly 42 minutes.The figures come amid concerns that young people are spending far too long on their computers and smart phones on Facebook and Snapchat.ONS said: \u0027The internet was a very different place at the start of the century – with no Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube or Instagram – and no smartphones or tablets to access it. \u0027The biggest changes to how 18-year-olds spend their time may be driven in part by the rise of digital technology.\u0027Time 18-year-olds spent socialising, which includes meeting friends and family, visiting pubs or cafes, or talking on the phone, declined by 27 minutes per day between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015.\u0027Time spent computing, which includes using social media, went up by 17 minutes per day, while 18-year-olds spent an additional 31 minutes playing games including computer games. \u0027There was also a rise in the amount of time spent on sport and exercise, up by 8 minutes per day.

He\u0027s inciting violence, he\u0027s inciting civil war, in my opinion,\u0027 he said.\u0027And when you start attacking someone for a stupid comment, that feeds into that desire on his part to split us down the middle.\u0027So I don\u0027t want to think of Roseanne as an enemy because she said something really stupid and offensive, I just don\u0027t want to, I\u0027m not going to go down that road.\u0027It starts with the president of the United States, trying to find ways to ide us and to create violence in the end, and I don\u0027t want to be a part of that.\u0027 Schiff spoke exclusively to DailyMailTV as he attended TV Legend Ed Asner\u0027s 6th Annual Celebrity Poker Tournament raising funds for autism, in Los Angeles.Schiff\u0027s comments come in the wake of comic Norm Macdonald facing a firestorm for insinuating that Roseanne and Louis C.K. deserved a second chance.Macdonald\u0027s comments saw Jimmy Fallon cancel an appearance on Tuesday\u0027s Tonight Show, then Macdonald telling Howard Stern on his Wednesday Sirius XM radio show his comments had been misconstrued, only to create more controversy.In his initial interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said \u0027I do think that at some point it will end with a completely innocent person of prominence sticking a gun in his head and ending it.

Around 27,000 fled as refugees to the UK, where they could settle as they still had British passports. The rest mainly moved to India, Canada and neighbouring Kenya. Some smuggled their jewellery out of the country, which they sold to buy businesses in their new lands.

That\u0027s the only way I\u0027m going to describe it.\u0027 Miss Husain, who earns between £220,000 - £2229,999 a year at the BBC, lived in the Middle East between the ages of two and twelve and went on to study law at Cambridge University.The star, who won the Broadcaster of the Year Award at the London Press Club Awards in 2015 and is the first Muslim presenter of the Today programme, said the fact that she worked at a public service broadcaster makes the level of scrutiny \u0027intense\u0027.She said: \u0027I\u0027m in a very privileged position, where I can question the powerful, and have an audience in the millions, and that\u0027s an extraordinary position to be in.          Mishal also read the news for BBC World when she was just 30-years-old\u0027But it just means that that level of scrutiny is very intense. I couldn\u0027t point at anything in particular, but it still happens even now, that a night before an early shift I think, what am I going to find on my desk in the morning, and trying to anticipate.\u0027And now I\u0027ve learned that whatever\u0027s there, I\u0027m going to deal with it at the point I see it, and whatever\u0027s there, I\u0027ll gain nothing from worrying about it, apart from not getting enough sleep, which is a much more risky path to go down. And then I might make more mistakes!\u0027It took me three years to be able to deal with the ups and downs in a more measured way. If I\u0027d have stopped at any point in that three years, I\u0027d have looked back and thought, I never really felt quite at ease in that job, and thought it was about me. Whereas now I can look back and think, I never felt at ease during those three years because it\u0027s a hard job to do.\u0027Often we think it\u0027s about us. But it\u0027s because we\u0027re putting ourselves out there and doing something difficult and that\u0027s not going to come easy.\u0027   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/01/44FC9E1C00000578-6166375-image-a-35_1536886777137.jpg","title":"Labour MP Chi Onwurah claims 250 expenses pay voice coach","story":"    Chi Onwurah filed the claim under the headline \u0027training\u0027 for a £250 voice coach (Chi Onwurah pictured left with MP Jack Dromy right at lobbying event in London)A Labour MP claimed £250 in expenses to pay for a voice coach, official documents show.The latest tranche from the expenses watchdog shows Chi Onwurah filed the claim under the headline \u0027training\u0027.

But the others are soaring with me. This is it — I am flying with my goose family. I raised these birds from chicks and now we are flying together.In fact, I knew my geese long before they hatched. I even read them stories while they were still in the egg. Don\u0027t laugh — this was part of a scientific experiment, to ensure the chicks recognised me from the moment they were born and adopted me as their mother.Or, to give myself some dignity, their father. I am Papa Goose.When I first met them they were large white eggs in an incubator, in the basement of the Max Planck Institute For Ornithology in Radolfzell, Germany, close to the border with Switzerland.The contraption looks a bit like a convection oven, with warm air circulated to distribute it evenly at 37.5C (99.5F) — no more, no less.Share this articleThe whole thing is a fully automated version of a mother goose\u0027s underside, though I had to take the eggs out to cool every day for half an hour, before misting them with cold water and replacing them in the incubator.This mimics conditions in the wild when mama leaves the nest briefly to take a dip, and returns with a wet bottom.The goal was for the geese, when grown, to wear small data loggers on their backs, which would capture information to help researchers build a precise picture of the birds\u0027 flight dynamics.A successful project could lead, we hoped, to mounting these devices on birds all over the world, collecting meteorological data to be relayed back via satellite.I was chosen to be Papa Goose because I could fly. But the timing was difficult. I was newly orced and the break-up was stressful.I couldn\u0027t neglect the goose eggs, but I also didn\u0027t want to take time away from my children, Amelie and Ronin. I wasn\u0027t sure if I had the emotional resources for looking after a clutch of baby geese.So apart from the need to get the unhatched chicks used to my voice, one reason I was reading aloud to the eggs was to keep myself calm. I chose The Wonderful Adventures Of Nils, a Swedish tale about a boy who flies away on the back of a farm goose.          Relaxing with Papa Goose: Michael takes a break with his goslings Baby geese aren\u0027t picky about choosing their parents. They latch onto whatever they first see after hatching: it might be a human, a doll or even a football.I also placed one of my musty old T-shirts into the incubator next to the eggs, because smell is important in goose recognition. And I accustomised them to two other sounds, apart from my voice: a recording of the Ultralight plane\u0027s engine, and the honk of a metal horn with a black rubber bulb.A day before hatching, I heard the first soft peep from inside an egg. At 7am next day the first cracks appeared, and I was giddy with emotion. It was almost like being 15 again and falling in love.\u0027Papa\u0027s here waiting for you,\u0027 I said softly to the eggs — and at the sound of my voice they all started peeping excitedly.          Cheek to cheek: Michael quickly bonded with the new chicks At my daughter\u0027s insistence, I named the firstborn gosling Gloria — mistaking him for a girl goose. It took the chick an hour to break through the shell with her \u0027egg tooth\u0027, a horny growth on the bill that disappears after hatching.It\u0027s no accident the eggs didn\u0027t all hatch at once: the mother goose can\u0027t care for six newborns simultaneously. It\u0027s even thought that, still in the egg, goslings peep to establish a hatching order.Gloria tried to lift her head in my direction but she was too weak. She just lay in the incubator, recovering her strength.The first physical contact is critical. If Gloria was to accept me, she had to be close and soak me up with all her senses. So I lifted her gently to my mouth and whispered my best goose noises: \u0027Gagagaga! Weeweeweeweewee!\u0027Then I tucked her under my jumper, against my skin. For the next few weeks, my home was a trailer in the institute grounds, nicknamed Duckingham Palace. I laid Gloria in the laundry basket that was to be her bed — but she responded with desperate peeps.She didn\u0027t want to be alone. I slipped her back under my sweater. That night, when she was still the only chick to have hatched, I put her on a towel next to my head.          Follow the leader: Michael and his seven goslings go for a swim in a lakeThat was no good: within five seconds she had slithered under the duvet and back onto my chest, where she gave her \u0027sleepy call\u0027. It sounds like someone gently blowing into a whistle. I lay there, unable to sleep for fear of rolling on her, without moving all night.Next day, my eyes were opened at 5.15am by the sound of a cuckoo outside the trailer window. I squinted, and saw a golden fluffball sitting on my chest. Her contented peeps seemed to say: \u0027Isn\u0027t it great, Papa? I was awake anyway!\u0027That day, Gloria got six brothers and sisters. As soon as I took them all back to the trailer, we had a good cuddle. It felt wonderful, because goslings are so soft, but it also meant I had to change my shirt within the hour. Baby geese are world-class poopers.AS NIGHT fell, I placed them all together in the laundry basket on the floor, but they would only settle when I dangled one of my hands over the side of the bed and touched them.If I tried to remove it, they peeped pitifully. The goslings needed me as unconditionally as a human baby needs its parents.          Keep up kids! Michael on a stroll with his seven goslingsI was an unlikely father for geese. I wasn\u0027t vegetarian, but now — suddenly — I couldn\u0027t stomach the thought of eating any bird. When a colleague brought me a chicken curry takeaway, I had to pick out all the meat.I was soon used to rising at 5.15am. The goslings gave me no choice. They travelled under my jumper, where they formed a heated feather pillow with a mind of its own.When they were three days old, I put out a paddling pool. Nemo was first to jump in — he needed no demonstrations — but soon all the chicks were frolicking happily, splashing and playing submarines.They were already becoming independent and, that evening, I placed my old T-shirt in their basket. They seemed to accept this as a substitute for my hand. I finally got a good night\u0027s sleep.Before long, they were ready for a real lake. I donned my brand-new rubber wetsuit, which caused all the chicks to eye me with a touch of suspicion. But they soon forgot their worries, and were splashing and ing in the cold water. My head was surrounded by seven gabbling feather balls, all greatly enjoying themselves.I was beginning to notice an unexpected change in myself, too. Thanks to the geese, I was finding it easier to accept that, following my orce, I wasn\u0027t able to see my own children all the time.The first time I took them to the meadow that was to be our runway, I was sitting on the grass, surrounded by my chicks, when I looked up and saw three hawks — two kites and a buzzard. I was horrified. How could I have been so careless and unaware of the circling dangers?Shouting and whirling my coat, I led the goslings to safety. The hawks got the message: don\u0027t mess with Papa Goose. The next day, I showed the birds the electric Ultralight for the first time.I wheeled it out of the barn and started the propellor. They didn\u0027t take much notice.Seizing the horn, I honked it loudly three times and shouted: \u0027Ready?\u0027 Then I set off on foot at a sprint over the grass.The little geese raced after me like seven golden tennis balls. It warmed my heart to see them running with their stubby wings outstretched, eager to be reunited with their Papa Goose.After a few runs, I led them to the shade of the plane\u0027s wing, to help them feel safe with it.Seeing how confident the geese were with humans, I started taking them to a popular town lake, usually crowded with sunbathers.People did a double-take at the sight of a man with seven growing geese at his heel, and children wanted to stroke them.Soon, the geese were too large to register on the predatory buzzards\u0027 radar as potential snacks.And then the moment of truth . . . We stood on a grassy hill and the geese were lined up behind me.I looked at the meadow below us, stretched out my arms, and called to them. I honked the horn and ran down the slope, waving my arms, a rowdy gaggle of seven adolescent geese trailing behind me.I had to be careful not to trip over my feet, especially when Calimero, Freddy, and Glorio flew past a few feet off the ground, necks stretched forward and wings fully extended. They were flying. Really flying!My GEESE were full of surprises, not least when I took a sample of blood from each of them and sent it for DNA analysis. The results showed that all seven were in fact male. That seemed improbable, but true. Some name changes were necessary — Gloria became Glorio and Frieda became Freddy.Nemo\u0027s weight was a worry. Once his brothers started flying, he preferred to stay on the ground, eating dandelions.Eventually, even he took to the air, and we soared together as if we\u0027d been doing it all our lives. I was surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving heads. The geese became so familiar with the Ultralight that they began to gabble loudly as soon as they saw it from afar. It was time for my first flight with them.I climbed into the cockpit and taxied slowly toward the start of the runway. The geese were in a crate under the right wing.Nervousness spread through my system. \u0027Now! Off we go!\u0027 I called, and Laura opened the crate.I squeezed the horn with all my might. The geese stormed out of the crate, and we raced down the runway together. Nils was first to fly, then Glorio, and I found myself surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving necks.We were flying together for the first time. \u0027Yippee!\u0027I saw something close up that most bird-watchers only see through binoculars if lucky — goose aerobatics. They will turn onto their backs in mid-air and e towards the ground before righting themselves. It seems they do it just because they can.My favourite manoeuvre was the landing: almost vertically, no need for a runway, coming down on their feet as gracefully as helicopters.          A grelag goose, the goslings will grow to the size of this goose (pictured) If I had a favourite, I suppose it was Paul. He was such an affectionate creature. But it was Paul who first left home, at least briefly. I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised: in the wild, greylag geese stay with their parents for a few weeks or less, and by now my birds had been with me several months.A sudden storm scattered the flock. I expected them to come flapping back at once, but it took a lot of calling and honking before they returned. All except Paul.Hours passed, and I was beginning to despair, when I spotted a V-shaped flight of wild geese, high above. Something told me one of those specks belonged to me.Grabbing the horn, I honked and honked. The goose at the back peeled off, quickly lost altitude and landed in the next field. He hopped rather than waddled towards me.I buried my nose in his neck and breathed in the scent of his feathers. Right at this point, adult geese still smell like little goslings.But geese don\u0027t make good pets. They can never be house-broken. And mine were always yearning to be independent. Gradually, my flock began to break up.Rebel Freddy was the first to go. He became disobedient, refusing to fly with the rest. I tried setting him free on a lake, but a few days later when I checked on him, I could see he had not been eating.To compound the problem, when I returned him to the aviary, the other birds didn\u0027t want to know him. Only Maddin was still prepared to be his friend.Then, tragically, we lost Nemo. He injured his neck in the aviary, no one knows how. The vet was unable to save him, and he had to be put down. I was bitterly upset and desolated a second time when, following a successful flight, another microlight aircraft panicked Paul. He flew off, and I never saw him again. I can only hope he rejoined that wild flock.Clearly, it was time to find permanent homes for the other birds. Calimero and Nils were taken in by a wildlife park, and now they make friends with visitors every day.Freddy and Maddin discovered their vocation, pestering visitors at the boating lake for scraps of bread and crumbs from the cafe tables. They are doing well on it.Glorio, eldest of the brothers, answered the call of the wild. Twice I saw him on a small pond next to the airfield, in the midst of a group of greylags.He seemed so completely independent it was only by his red leg-band that I could positively identify him. I don\u0027t know if he noticed me, but I watched the geese as they flew away until they were nothing more than black dots on the horizon. For one brief moment, I was proud just like a real dad.During our experiment together, we made more than 60 flights and I gathered a colossal amount of data, enough for several PhD theses. We also proved that data loggers can be carried by geese in flight without any hindrance, opening the way for this method to be used by meteorologists all round the world.But most of all, my seven goslings helped me find myself again after orce. I used to fight and rage against the complications of my life. The geese showed me what really matters: loving others and loving life itself.Adapted from Papa Goose: One Year, Seven Goslings And The Flight Of My Life by Michael Quetting (Greystone Books, £16.99). © Michael Quetting 2018.To order a copy for £13.59 (offer valid to September 20, 2018 p\u0026ampp free on orders over £15), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.Shop Books \u0026amp DVDs at MailShop.co.uk"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/22/5025072600000578-0-image-a-40_1536874347046.jpg","title":"New iPhones big women hold","story":"    Apple has been criticised for designing iPhones too big for women\u0027s handsAfter announcing the launch of its new range on Wednesday, four other iPhone models were removed from Apple\u0027s website.

Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/07/1AA9E48800000514-0-image-a-5_1536819691050.jpg","title":"UK trigger no deal Brexit plans November tells Cabinet","story":"Share this articleBritain need not be afraid of a no-deal Brexit - we stand ready to rise to the challenges ahead"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/09/501E335F00000578-6163037-image-a-4_1536828179998.jpg","title":"Lion looks sheepish appears telling mating lioness","story":"    The dramatic photographs show the lioness roaring at the king of the jungle who looks shocked at her obvious displeasure          The lion and lioness were captured having a sexual encounter in the Massai Mara before the lion receives a telling off          Following their mating session the lioness roars in fury at her male counterpart in a state of frustration and rage  Clearly caught off guard the lion stares at her with a sheepish look and cowers in fear in a state of shock          The lion still looks in shock after the animals have stopped roaring at one another This is not the first time a lion has been on the receiving end of a furious lioness. In January, George Hart captured an angry lioness roaring into the face of the lion in the Central Serengeti, Tanzania during his first ever African safari.The lion was spotted cowering away in fear and covering his face with his paw during the fierce lovers\u0027 tiff.In July, game reserve manager, Giuseppe D\u0027amico, spotted an enraged lioness slapping her partner across the face on the green plains of Tanzania in the Ndutu area.The fighting pair were also seen baring their teeth at each other during the domestic dispute.   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/09/4FAFFC5D00000578-0-image-m-8_1536654768818.jpg","title":"Incredible moment one year old baby swims pool climbs herself","story":"    Water baby: Kassia pushes off from the side of the pool and takes to the water, swiming without the help of any adults          Child\u0027s play: The youngster was able to climb out of the pool unaided after swimming in the water\u0027I want justice.

Although it\u0027s a lot more accepted in our society today, we still see children, teens, and adults being ridiculed and discriminated against for being the way we are. Some have even taken their lives because of it. As long as those things are still happening, I will continue to do my best to bring more awareness to this issue and to fight for equality. Whether the LGBTQ is what you support or not, we must liberate and encourage each other to be our best selves, whatever that may be. It\u0027s the only way we can make this world a better place for future generations.I don\u0027t want this to be focused on me.

Each illustrates or explores the theme: Extravaganza – Out of the Ordinary.The festival is enlivened by the inventive staging of its exhibits. Works of both established and emerging photographers are displayed in an astonishing variety of unconventional venues and locations.A railway platform, a phone booth, a church, a dilapidated hardware shop, even the waters of Lake Geneva serve to showcase the pictures.Photography studios, by Antonina Gugala.Gugala’s project exploring Warsaw’s portrait businesses is installed adjacent to Vevey’s sole remaining, and soon-to-close, photo studio.For Stefano Stoll, the festival’s director, such theatricality helps encourage a broad public engagement with the work, which he insists must be readily comprehensible. Furthermore, he hopes that the use of locations around the town will add layers of meaning to the pictures, whether these are playful, serious or ironic. Thus placing a photograph of an airborne whale high above viewers’ heads, or photographs of the pages of Frank Sinatra’s phonebook on the inside of a phonebooth, or pictures of detention cells behind the bars of a former prison, adds to the experience.Arnold Odermattdocumented the daily life of his colleagues in the Swiss police force for more than 40 years. His work is positioned – not without irony – alongside the busy main thoroughfare through Vevey. While waiting at the lights motorists can take a moment to enjoy the work of a one-time chief of transport police.Jun Ahn’s dizzying self-portraits on skyscrapers and window ledges show the artist pushing herself to a literal limit. However she might appear, she says she is not without fear. Ahn says: “Some media described me as a fearless artist, but I’m really not that. I really have a fear and this is about that fear and how the photography medium subverts the context of the fear.” Her work is installed in the Hôtel des Trois Couronnes, where she appears poised on a window ledge, and perched on one of its balconies.Jono Rotman’s unnerving portraits are of members of New Zealand’s Mongrel Mob, an infamous gang of predominantly Maori bikers. Over a 10-year period Rotman established a relationship with them marked by trust and confidence. Their reputation for violence, adoption of nationalistic symbols, and indeed their appearance, guarantee their marginal status in New Zealand. In Vevey their pictures are on show in the bustling Grande Place, the heart of civic life.Castore’s work focuses on an elderly lady and her brother, Ewa and Piotr, whom he befriended in Kraków. Though the two were leading isolated, lives in a run-down apartment, even lacking hot water, it emerged that they had once enjoyed a wealthy upbringing. Castore juxtaposes his portraiture with earlier pictures from Ewa’s own collection. They are displayed in an appropriately neglected former hardware shop.Erik Kessels, tireless champion of vernacular photography, is exhibiting some 2,000 album covers inside Église Sainte-Claire. The sleeves all feature photographs of large choirs or bands, the more members the merrier. A cacophonous multilayered choral soundtrack adds an other-worldy element.Pink Cells, 20132017, Angélique Stehli, installed behind bars in the town’s former prison.Angélique Stehli’s arresting photographs of pink detention cells are themselves behind the bars of a former prison.

Jobs denied paternity, and declared in a deposition that he was sterile. After a DNA test showed they were in fact father and daughter, he agreed to pay her mother, Chrisann Brennan, $500 a month. A few days later, Apple became a public company and Jobs’s net worth shot up overnight to $200m.Relating this tale in her memoir, Brennan-Jobs doesn’t berate or make excuses for her father. As the founder of NeXT and co-founder of Apple, Jobs enjoyed enormous power in his working life. At home, he exerted power by withholding things: money, conversation, affection. Nowadays his behaviour would be seen as abusive, but, for Brennan-Jobs, it was normal. It was simply what her father did.The title of this memoir comes from Jobs’s nickname for his daughter, a term of endearment that demonstrated he was capable of warmth when the mood took him. He was mostly absent until she was eight, when he began dropping by her mother’s house in Palo Alto to take Lisa roller-skating. Grateful as she was for his attention, she remained uncomfortable in his presence, fearful of irritating him or overstepping the mark. Throughout the book, she depicts herself as an outsider whose relationship with her dad was characterised by confusion and shame. “For him,” she says, “I was a blot on a spectacular ascent, as our story did not fit with the narrative of greatness and virtue he might have wanted for himself. My existence ruined his streak.”Small Fry isn’t about eliciting sympathy or seeking revenge. Instead she tries to get to the bottom of a relationship mired in awkwardness and unpredictability. In exposing her father’s more unpleasant traits, her language betrays her trepidation. Not given to drama or sentimentality, it is sparse though precise. The more shocking the anecdote, the more economical her description, though her wounds are clear.There are only fleeting references to Jobs’s working life. This is, after all, Brennan-Jobs’s memoir, not a biography of her father. As well aschronicling her early life, it is a lesson in how our identity and self-esteem are moulded by those charged with the task of raising us. Rejection and frustration are running themes.Brennan-Jobs’s mother is depicted as nurturing, creative and free spirited but also given to frightening outpourings of bitterness at their circumstances. “I don’t want this life,” she once screamed in the car in front of her four-year-old daughter. “I want out. I’m sick of living.” While Jobs could be funny and perceptive, more often he was severe and condescending. Long after his paternity was proven, he would tell people that Lisa wasn’t really his child, and that his existence in her life was an act of charity. He would decide not to pay for things at the last minute, walking out of restaurants without paying the bill, and told his daughter, then nine, that she would never get a penny from him.In her teens, as her relationship with her mother became fractious, he invited her to live with him and his wife, Laurene, and their baby son, on the condition that she didn’t see or speak to Chrisann for six months. Brennan-Jobs hoped that living with him would allow her to get to know him better, which in many ways it did. After years of neglect, he now became mean and controlling. When she became involved in after-hours school projects, he felt aggrieved at her absence. “If you want to be part of this family, you need to put in the time,” he would say, and then ignore her for days. He would also grope Laurene in front of her, moaning ostentatiously. When Lisa got up to leave on one such occasion, he stopped her. “‘Hey Lis’,’ he said. ‘Stay here. We’re having a family moment.’”Hers is, of course, a one-sided account, one that has been backed by her mother but staunchly rejected by her stepmother and her aunt, the writer Mona Simpson. In memoirs, as in life, one person’s fact is often another’s fiction. Brennan-Jobs doesn’t emerge smelling of roses either. She is fitfully cruel to her mother, she steals $100 bills from Jobs’s bedroom as a teenager, and compulsively pinches trinkets from his house as he lies dying. In his final days, he asks her if she is going to write about him. “No,” she replies. Her father has rarely been portrayed as a saint but Small Fry reveals him as a man capable of startling selfishness and cruelty to those closest to him.

It said shoppers would receive an email in “a couple of days”.In recent weeks, customers have used the store’s Facebook page and other social media sites to complain that they have not been contacted andor received refunds.Charlotte Kerr’s post on Facebook is typical: “It’s been nearly a month and I still haven’t heard anything, my emails are being ignored and my credit card company has told me that I have to keep pursuing a refund from HoF. Not sure how I’m supposed to do that when they’re ignoring all attempts to contact them.”The promise of refunds came the day after House of Fraser shut down its website amid a dispute over payment between Sports Direct and XPO, the company that delivered online orders.The website was expected to reopen this week after a deal was agreed with XPO, but was still closed on Thursday afternoon.Shoppers who have tried to return faulty goods have found them returned by Royal Mail after House of Fraser’s warehouse refused to accept them.Holders of the House of Fraser gift cards who were told to send them to a Glasgow office are still waiting to hear whether they will be replaced, as previously suggested.Sports Direct has no legal obligation to refund orders made before House of Fraser went into administration. EY said there was little prospect of customers awaiting goods receiving any money back from the administration process.A spokeswoman said it could be a few pence for each pound spent, if that, and any payments would take at least 12 months. She suggested affected customers should be claiming from their card or payment providers first. has repeatedly asked House of Fraser to clarify its position on refunds, but the retailer has declined to respond.Steve Nowottny, of MoneySavingExpert, said House of Fraser customers had been left in limbo.“While there’s often confusion in this sort of situation, communication to House of Fraser customers has been particularly poor, with many unanswered questions over online orders, gift cards and return rights,” Nowottny said. “House of Fraser needs to act straight away to ensure that customers who have been left sometimes hundreds of pounds out of pocket are refunded immediately.”Last week one customer who had ordered an undelivered sofa entered the Darlington store with friends and removed the sofa she had bought. Staff called the police, who pulled over her van as she drove home, but officers let her continue when she showed them the receipt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1901e330985f2dea391bb2c2dbe919ea9460d0d/0_70_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d68e1b192b62cce7c787ad40fe423287","title":"raab says companies are wrong to blame brexit for their woes","story":"Brexit secretary tells Radio 4 firms are wrong to blame leaving Europe for their woesThe Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, has clashed with senior business leaders after he attacked struggling companies for blaming Brexit on their woes.Business organisations hit back after Raab told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Brexit was becoming a scapegoat for underperforming firms.He said: “It’s probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business which isn’t doing rather well to point to Brexit.“I don’t doubt that some of the uncertainty around these negotiations will have an impact on business – that’s why we are putting all our energy into getting the good deal we want with our EU friends and partners.“All I’m gently saying it’s rather easy for a business to blame Brexit and the politicians rather than taking responsibility for their own situation.”The Conservatives are traditionally viewed as the party of business, yet relations have deteriorated over the party’s handling of Brexit as company bosses grow increasingly concerned over the risk of no deal.Raab noted that official figures this week showed economic growth accelerating, while wage growth has also picked up and is now ahead of inflation.His comments came after the John Lewis Partnership saw its profits all but wiped out in the past six months. The group, which also owns the Waitrose grocery chain, said: “With the level of uncertainty facing consumers and the economy, in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations, forecasting is particularly difficult but we continue to expect full year profits to be substantially lower than last year for the partnership as a whole.”Responding to Raab’s comments, Mayfield said: “I didn’t actually say that Brexit is to blame for our results. But the fact is that sterling is weaker and one of the factors in that is uncertainty.”Since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, a number of companies have blamed poor performance on the uncertainty created by the vote, along with the weaker pound for raising their costs, amid growing fears that the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal.However, the Morrisons chief executive, David Potts, insisted the supermarket group had not seen any change in consumer behaviour, when asked if Brexit was affecting sales. He said: “Consumers are a little bit more concerned about the country’s macroeconomic position rather than feeling the pinch in their own circumstances in which they feel fairly confident.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cdea5de9aa8f9efda316d8eac4504dea6d00082/0_223_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f275a22dedc7d70357b4dc24b11bbd2","title":"volkswagen to stop making its iconic beetle in 2019","story":"Company to produce two special editions of famed model before ceasing productionVolkswagen will stop making the Beetle car next year, ending nearly seven decades of production, the company has announced.﻿The company’s American unit said it would halt output at its plant in Mexico after making two special edition models of the third-generation bulbous bug in July 2019.The compact Beetle was introduced in Germany in 1938 during the Nazi era and came to the US 11 years later, where it became a symbol of utilitarian transportation often used by hippies.The car attained further popularity with the 1968 Disney movie The Love Bug, the story of a racing Volkswagen with a mind of its own.Andy Warhol did prints featuring the car and a\u0026nbspBeetle\u0026nbspwas also the most prominent car in the background of Abbey Road, the final Beatles album to be recorded.The car sold for about 30 years before production ceased in 1979.Volkswagen revived it in 1998 as a more modern “New Beetle”, attracting mainly female buyers. The company revamped it for the 2012 model year in an effort to make it appeal to men, giving it a flatter roof, less bulbous shape, a bigger trunk and a navigation system. US sales rose fivefold to nearly 29,000 in the first year, but tailed off after that. The special editions will come in coupe and convertible body styles and there will be unique beige and blue colours in addition to the normal hues. There will also be standard extra chrome, new wheels and three-colour ambient lighting inside.Volkswagen has no immediate plans to revive the Beetle again, but the company wouldn’t rule it out. “I would say ‘never say never’,” VW of America CEO Hinrich Woebcken said in a statement.VW continues to deal with fallout from the “dieselgate” scandal that broke in September 2015.The company, having already paid out costly government settlements, is fighting billions of dollars in additional claims lodged by shareholders who saw their stock plummet in value after authorities cracked down on VW over the installation of so-called “defeat devices” into 11m cars worldwide to fool regulatory emissions tests.Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a526903268f9c454f76706d3f3b67bdb76fa05ec/0_326_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62bcace6efd44692540a210e5d2f1798","title":"john lewis is in a flap but theres no need to undersell itself","story":"Back in the 1990s the partnership was in a mess. Today’s woes look tame by comparisonThe department stores swung to an operating loss of £33m in “the most promotional market we’ve seen in almost a decade,” as chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield put it. Well, yes, House of Fraser and Debenhams have been flapping wildly and can’t be ignored by a business with a “never knowingly undersold” price promise. That pledge is painful for the business now, but the long-term view is surely correct – it has to be maintained in all weathers.The fall in sterling, shoving up the cost of imported goods, is also a fact of life, even if Brexit secretary Dominic Raab would like to pretend otherwise. But the department stores’ customers seem to be loyal since revenues were virtually flat. It could be worse. Elton John is rumoured for the Christmas ad. John Lewis would be pushing its luck with Rocket Man, but I’m Still Standing would work.Bob Diamond emerges from The Bank That Lived a Little, Philip Augar’s superb recent history of modern Barclays, as a more rounded inidual than you might expect. The ultra-competitive American with a blind-spot on bonuses is fully present, of course. But Diamond also led Barclays’ creation of an investment bank that could compete on Wall Street, a challenge that defeated every other UK bank that tried. That required skill as well as ambition.So Diamond’s reflections 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers ought to be noteworthy. Unfortunately, he has offered an absurdly self-serving account.First, Diamond argued in an interview with the BBC that the public should be angry with Royal Bank of Scotland for requiring bail-outs but “HSBC and Barclays deserve credit for raising capital privately” and not putting themselves at risk. Come on, Barclays enjoyed a huge slice of luck in 2007 when it lost the battle with RBS to buy ABN Amro, the deal that holed the Edinburgh-based bank.The supposed safety features in Barclays’ version – paying in shares, not cash, and buying all of ABN, not just the rotten wholesale ision – could easily have failed. Even Barclays’ directors glimpsed danger. Augar records the board fretting in September 2007, in the early days of the credit crisis, that RBS would pull out.Barclays was also lucky that then-chancellor Alistair Darling killed the next adventure – the 11th-hour attempt to buy Lehman before its bankruptcy, as opposed to picking up some non-toxic pieces afterwards. That would not have ended well. And it’s not as if Barclays got no help from the UK public. It raised its capital privately (and controversially) in the Middle East but, like all big UK banks, Barclays benefitted from credit guarantees underwritten by the UK government.Second, he still defends the culture of Barclays. “I don’t think the reprehensible behaviour of a few people out of 160,000 employees is representative of the culture we had at Barclays – I think we had a very strong culture,” he told the BBC.Yes, there were worse culprits who paid even bigger conduct penalties. But recall a line from City lawyer Anthony Salz’s in-depth review in 2013: “The culture that emerged tended to favour transactions over relationships, the short term over sustainability, and financial over other business purposes.” That is not what most people would call “strong”.Third, Diamond now says he fears banks have become too cautious in their risk-taking and so can’t support growth in the economy. Try telling that to Barclays’ shareholders as they look at a share price of 172p versus 700p in the old days. At the last count, there were £180bn of risk-weighted assets in Barclays’ corporate and investment bank, which sounds like quite enough risk, especially as the successors have yet to work out how to make consistent returns from Diamond’s creation.He is free to push his glossy account, of course. But it would be alarming if today’s bankers pine for his vision. Sadly, one suspects many do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc06c56fe4d7be3ebb5aff21aa0144ff42a629ac/69_180_4831_2898/master/4831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49c8a4c076be5ae888feb80d2974b6b8","title":"jacob rees mogg children activists","story":"On Tuesday evening, activists targeted the Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, his wife, four of his young children and the family’s nanny outside their London home. “Your daddy is a horrible person,” a protester told the kids.A few weeks ago, Emily Benn faced intensely personal abuse for voicing her opinions about antisemitism in the Labour party – much of it invoking the legacy of her late grandfather, the Labour MP Tony Benn. After these incidents, I was asked to share a few thoughts from the perspective of a politician’s son – my late father was the Labour MP Paul Goggins. Naturally, I had some reticence, not least because of the dissonance in using a platform I was offered because Dad was an MP to appeal for politicians’ families to be left alone. You don’t need me to condemn Tuesday’s incident pretty much the entire political system has taken care of that, and anyone who has seen the video footage knows it was wrong. (It has also spectacularly backfired on the people involved, but that’s another story.)The Rees-Mogg children are all under the age of 12: they’re old enough to have been scared and to remember this forever, but probably too young to understand what was happening. I don’t know Ms Benn, but I admire the grace with which she has handled attacks on her: these incidents are specifically designed to be hurtful.Being the child of a politician can be challenging. There is a lot of time apart and incredibly long hours. There can be hostility from otherwise reasonable people, and your life is filled with (bad) assumptions about privileged access – especially if you’re interested in public policy. Heaven forbid MPs bring up children who end up curious about public service.But you get used to all that. On the whole, for my family it was a positive thing. We had some great experiences and met some inspirational people because of Dad’s job. He also had a mercifully low public profile – certainly lower than Jacob Rees-Mogg or the Benns. He barely made the news until he died. We’ve been very lucky, and we’re very grateful for it.In isolation, situations such as those involving the Rees-Moggs and Emily Benn are widely condemned but, taken together, they reflect a big increase in the amount of hatred in politics.Dad died four and a half years ago, and I don’t think he would recognise today’s political dialogue. Progress in his constituency of Wythenshawe and Sale East, in the Home Office and especially in Northern Ireland, was achieved quietly, the product of two-way conversations. He was a decent man who listened more than he talked, and cared deeply about peace, justice and people in poverty. Put all that together and bridges get built.Self-styled “activists” shouting at children abusing the memory of someone’s dead relative just to hurt her Boris Johnson picking on marginalised groups for his own political ends the inability of the Labour party to have a grownup conversation about something as important as racism – they all reflect a tangible increase in hostility that has infected politics. Some might think it’s because we’re “snowflakes”, but over time this invective threatens to profoundly change us and the way we do things. We have fallen a long way in a short time.Burn all your bridges and you end up trapped the only place to go is further out towards the edge. Extremes of any form are bad news – a cursory glance at 20th century history tells us that.Dad’s approach was that, despite our differences, we’re all ultimately on the same team that people in Wythenshawe are connected to people in Wembley that if people in Belfast are struggling, it matters to people in Burnley.The viciousness with which some people are approaching politics now undermines the team spirit that has served our country well whenever we’ve been tested. I have maximum solidarity with the Rees-Moggs’ children – they should absolutely be left alone. And I hope this incident hasn’t upset them too much. I hope by the time they’re all teenagers, our national conversation will have grown up too.I hope that years from now, when their dad sits them down to talk about his decades as a politician, they hear a story of how his ideas on how to deal with the biggest challenge our country has faced for 70 years – whether trade, regulation or the Irish border – were debated, and ultimately defeated, in parliament.

This was how a confident Dominic Raab attempted to “focus” Tory ultra-Brexiteers’ minds this morning in an appearance on the Today programme. Ahead of the release of the government’s second batch of no-deal notices, the Brexit secretary reminded everyone – should they have forgotten – what his preferred choice is: “It would be by far the optimum outcome to have a negotiated deal”.Not everyone agrees. With Tory Brexiteers desperate to chuck Chequers and keen to talk up the prospects of a World Trade Brexit (formerly known as no deal), these technical notices have come to be regarded with a heavy dose of suspicion. Are they helpful information for planning or actually part of a Downing Street effort to bounce the country into accepting Chequers?There’s plenty in today’s offering to make a no-deal Brexit seem more land of extra paperwork than land of milk and honey. Drivers could have to get two different international driving permits if they want to drive in European countries there would be no automatic legal basis for data transfers and then there’s the news that the UK would get less warning about space debris crashing to Earth.However, the papers are far from catastrophic in their content. For a change, the government could even be described as being on the front foot. The Brexit secretary managed to dodge one negative story by agreeing with phone companies in advance that free data roaming will continue even if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. There’s also the promise of blue passports from 2019 onwards – though for some that may be the worst news in the papers.It follows that today’s batch of warnings aren’t dramatic enough to move the dial either way in the Conservative party’s current Brexit debate. They are neutral enough in tone to avoid triggering a fresh bout of Tory civil war and prompt cries of “project fear”. Conversely, there are enough potential complications that those sceptical of leaving without a deal are unlikely to be converted.However, something significant has changed this week in the Tories’ Brexit battle – and that’s the mood in government. Despite reports of a Eurosceptic coup against the prime minister, Theresa May has had a rather good few days. Raab’s confident tone on the airwaves this morning belies the fact that ministers think the wind is turning in their favour on Chequers – and it’s all thanks to the Brexiteers. This was meant to be the week that the European Research Group finally set out their Brexit plan to rival the prime minister’s. That hasn’t happened. Creative differences over the 140-page document – which included plans to build a “Star Wars”-style missile shield to protect Britain from nuclear attack and an “expeditionary force” to defend the Falklands – meant that the plan had to be scrapped.Instead, the Brexiteers attempted a united front with an event on the merits of “no deal” and an event on the Irish border. The former saw its figures of £1.1tn benefit for Britain swiftly disputed and the latter backfired when a photo emerged in which all the leading Brexiteers were caught with their heads in their hands. It hardly sends the message that this a group with a plan should a time of national reckoning be on the horizon.With Brexiteers unable to agree on much other than the fact that they don’t like Chequers, Raab’s organisational skills – complete with technical notices – look approaching masterful by comparison. There are many Tory MPs who don’t like Chequers but a large chunk are also sceptical of no deal. Today’s no-deal notices are unlikely to have convinced them that it would be preferable. With no alternative plan to Chequers but “no deal”, Raab’s “optimum outcome” of a negotiated deal is looking more likely than it has for months.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ef7702663db84e8c61747b9008e823ff96dc2dd/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a869f1046c542a663f210e9d060b9ef2 1880w","title":"quebec lost narwhal adopted beluga whales","story":"Researchers in Quebec discovered the narwhal, over 100km outside its typical range, was playing with the whalesWhale researchers in Quebec’s St Lawrence River are celebrating a remarkable discovery: a juvenile narwhal far from its arctic home, that appears to have been adopted by a band of beluga whales.The narwhal, more than 1,000km outside its typical range, was filmed by a drone swimming and playing with dozens of belugas that were treating it as one of their own.With its long, spiral tusk and spotted grey skin, the narwhal stands out from the pack of white St Lawrence River belugas. But its cousins don’t seem to mind, rubbing up against the narwhal and playing sexual games common among young male whales. Although both are highly social animals, narwhals and belugas don’t typically interact when they meet in more northern waters. Belugas generally live in more northern waters, but a fluke of evolution means a branch of the species remained in the St Lawrence River after the last ice age. While they’re closely related to narwhals, they do have different hunting and ranging habits.Drones have given biologists greater access to the secret lives of whales, said Robert Michaud, the president of the Group for Research and Education on Marine Mammals, the organization that made the discovery.“We see just a fraction of their lives,” Michaud said. “We now have more powerful tools to examine these animals, and actually see their interactions. The more we study these animals, the more we find them fascinating.”The most intriguing question for researchers is what will happen to the young narwhal as it grows into an adult. Cross-breeding between the two species is believed to have occurred in some limited instances, but it’s rarely been documented. “If this young narwhal spends his life with belugas, we’ll have a lot of information to learn and share,” Michaud said. “I hope I’ll be there to see it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f82870fef8c7b1e82fa5d52fdcc0573de0ac66/0_472_6738_4043/master/6738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea01ae1c38527cd2e2b5e32755bf18f9","title":"decoding the power of the bathroom selfie","story":"How the loo became fashion’s favourite backdropA long row of sinks and at each one a woman, leaning. “They rummage through their handbags, pulling out various make-up items applying blushers, concealers and brightly coloured lip-glosses.” In the academic book Women And Alcohol: Social Perspectives, under the titillating heading Glamour Over Consumption, this ethnographic data from a city-centre pub in Canterbury explores the way a bathroom allows women to “assess their intoxication and femininity”, taking part in a familiar form of “calculated hedonism”. Backcombing her hair, one turns to the stranger at the next mirror and asks, “I don’t look too drunk, do I?” The stranger reassures her, of course, because that’s what women do, in the toilets, at night. We urinate, we check our lipstick, and we comfort each other that we look exactly the right amount of pissed. And sometimes, perhaps knowing that otherwise we might forget this moment of uncommon warmth, we take a photo, too.Even when we ignore the politics of bathrooms, tiny rooms that contain our most primal anxieties and where debates about gender identity continue to play out in the media, toilets (one of the last officially gender segregated spaces in the world) are unique as sites of extreme and glittering intimacy. No wonder then, that they have also become stage sets for Instagram. A shift happened after Anna Wintour’s selfie ban at last year’s Met Gala, when the impossibility of abiding by such a frankly mad law sent celebrities trotting with their phones to the bathroom. The resulting photos – from Kylie Jenner’s Last Supper-like selfie, featuring a menu of stars including Frank Ocean and Brie Larson pouting in the mirror, to those of models smoking louchely on the tiled floor, one shot captioned ‘Real VIP Room’– inspired an art exhibition in Brooklyn, where visitors received candy cigarettes on entry. Elsewhere, toilet selfies are going viral for different reasons. When Twitter user Paula Sophia Garcia Epsino posted a photo sitting on her aunt’s bathroom counter in Mexico, the internet paused to marvel, briefly, not at her tiny shorts, but at the boggling placing of a toilet roll holder across the room from the toilet. Each person imagined their inevitable waddle.It was a Tuesday night, and Leanne Elliott Young, a creative director based between London and New York, was stuck in the loo at Isabel, a new Mayfair restaurant where each toilet features a unique hand-painted wallpaper of tropical flamingoes or Korean peonies. She used the time to read the graffiti on her Ingrid Kraftchenko boots (“They’re not just shoes,” Young insists, “they are deep with sorrow, dramatic aggression, contemplations and conversations with the self”) and enjoy the drama of her Charles Jeffrey flag dress, after “decoding the visual syntax and semantics of this flag by @_charlesjeffrey”. The fancy bathroom, with its marble ledge and big mirror, was ideal. “Where else can you get your foot that close to your face?”The distant toilet roll holder is not a mistake many interior designers will make in future, having learned (through the millions of likes under hashtags such as Young’s) the importance of an Instagrammable bathroom, including the obligatory marble ledge. To scroll through bathroom selfies is to rinse yourself in orchids and the colour pink, with women selfie-ing themselves in poses they’d be shy to make in public. Or, after two or three drinks, with their friends. Or, after three or four, with strangers. Makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury, creator of “glow”, was hired to ensure the bathroom at London club Annabel’s, with its flowered ceiling and vaginal colour palette, was the optimal space for applying, then documenting, your makeup. She added lighting dials, for guests to perfect their reflection, and it worked – after washing their hands, women gather nightly, hand on hip, in a space built for photographs as much as hygiene. While bathrooms have always been the places where we bond and lounge and rebuild ourselves with new layers of bronzer, now they are being designed with the performance of femininity in mind. There are the girly pink powder rooms, the monochrome cells with tiles that tessellate oddly when drunk, like Ibérica in Leeds, the womby boudoirs, the maximalist jungles with erotic wallpapers and more pillows than a hospital, and the mind-bending halls of mirrors, such as the bathroom at Yotam Ottolenghi’s Nopi in London or Crazy Bear in Beaconsfield, where a single selfie goes on for miles.Young is a queen of the bathroom selfie (for her money, the top three are all in London: the Ritz, Sketch and Hoi Polloi), in part because of her sense of toilet humour. But she says the rise of the selfie has changed the bathroom experience. “Now it’s a place of cold blank pouty stares into the void of social media likes. Taking photos, most people forget to wash their hands. And you get to see the ugly side of a selfie. That blue steel pre-filter, pre-Facetune duck face. The idea of pouting semi-naked, somewhere you’ve just evacuated your bowels, still makes me laugh out loud.” Though she delights in sharing her own bathroom selfies, along with, at last Instagram count, 1.4 million others, it’s getting more difficult. “The queues were once miles long due to folk snorting coke now it’s because they’re tussling around to get the best shot. I’m in and out quite quick, toilet seat up, toilet rolls in full view, snap!”Which is not to say she hasn’t considered the place of the bathroom selfie in popular culture, compiling her own casual ethnographic data. “It’s a moment that blurs the private and public. It’s a public place that you’re private within.” There’s a lock on the door, “so it’s a private space to curate. To be scantily clad but snapping away. To be free!”Around Eva’s sink are her makeup recommendations for an Instagrammable night out (from left): Wonderglow, £38.50, Charlotte Tilbury. Eleventh Hour hair perfume, £48, Byredo.

I don’t think Grandma’s cooking was always better. Certainly, my grandmother’s wasn’t. She hadn’t met a packet she couldn’t open and regarded the notion that she should cook from scratch as a calculated insult. Likewise, the good old days were nowhere near as good as now: choice was limited, quality was poor and “abundance” was a word for spelling competitions, not a descriptive term to be applied to food stocks.I have long bridled at the insistence that the food cultures of our European neighbours are so much better than ours. It ignores the realities of history. Yes, trying to find a good meal in Britain outside the home (and inside it, for that matter) immediately after the second world war was as tricky as finding an honest banker in London’s Square Mile. Then again, during that war we industrialised food production to help fight a war of national survival, losing purchase on both cookery traditions and kitchen skills.And what’s so good about those robust food cultures anyway? They tend to be inward-looking and small-minded. Two weeks in Tuscany sounds like a fabulous idea. Then the reality slides in, like ink seeping slowly across blotting paper: day after day of the same bloody pasta dishes, the same rustic salads and anything for dessert as long as it’s tira-sodding-misu or something “inventive” involving pears and almonds. By day five, what you wouldn’t do for a bit of Thai food doesn’t bear thinking about. We eat more widely and thrillingly in Britain specifically because of the weakness of our indigenous food culture. And yet, here I sit on a sun-dappled terrace in south-west France, for, as I write, it is August and I am nothing if not a fully paid-up member of the Mainstream Media Liberal Elite. I have just returned from a run to the local boulangerie for armfuls of croissant baked this morning.In the kitchen, we have baskets of plump, misshapen tomatoes from the fields just below the house we are staying in, a board full of stinky French cheeses making a bid for freedom and slabs of paté that smell of all the best bits of ground animal. We have wandered the local market, buying up boxes of golden girolles from the local hillsides at prices that would make the mortgage payers of Islington weep, and loaves of a sweet, sticky pastry halfway between bread and cake, soaked in syrup and just enough fragrant flower water. We are debating whether it is rose or orange blossom, because here, on our sun-dappled terrace, we have nothing more important to detain us.Oh god. I have become the living, breathing embodiment of every damn filthy food cliche of which I claim to be suspicious I am the heir to snooty Elizabeth David made soft, wobbling, French-cheese-boosted flesh. But the thing is, I am loving every moment of it. We are often told that rage and anger are specialisms of the young. I try to subvert this by getting angry and staying that way. But it seems I am unequal to the task that all it takes to soothe me is a good selection of cheeses and a recently picked fig on the turn. It turns out that food cliches are cliches for a reason: because they are just so damn lovely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6240d11e6f0dddfac44f34fdd0ad6d6655f8eb7d/0_63_4312_2588/master/4312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b08cb48b3b74e3f1a6160af3568922d6","title":"atletico madrid manchester city womens champions league report","story":"Manchester City could not quite make it over the line, their resistance finally broken a minute from time. With the visitors leading thanks to a Gemma Bonner header, Atlético Madrid scored. The clock showed 89 minutes and it was a deflection that did it, Kenti Robles’s ball looping up over Karen Bardsley, but while there was fortune Atlético had sought its favour. There could be no complaints from City when the hosts finally equalised, and so this Champions League tie will be settled in a fortnight’s time.It will not be easy, City know. “Atlético are easily the best team in Spain,” their coach, Mark Cushing, said afterwards, having witnessed Spain’s league and cup winners first hand. City had held Atlético at bay for so long, Jen Beattie and Bonner heading clear cross after cross. Cushing admitted they had “kept it at 1-0” and lauded a defensive side his team are rarely required to draw upon.The night had started well for City, with Melissa Lawley forcing the corner from which they scored the opener. Caroline Weir clipped it towards the near post where Bonner leapt above Aurélie Kaci to head her first goal for the club. Atlético, though, worked their way into the game, momentum building as the first half progressed – and even more so when the second half did. City no longer exercised the control Keira Walsh had initially imposed, although there was always a sense of danger when they came forward – even if a couple of times Lawley and Nikita Parris lacked the precision to go with their pace.For Atlético, what had begun as isolated runs from the Brazilian Ludmila da Silva and Robles’s willingness to head up the right became a more collective enterprise, Amanda Sampedro exhibiting touch and invention. Karen Bardsley punched ahead of Ludmila Elena Linari struck over and a lovely exchange sparked by a superb turn from Silvia Meseguer and involving Ludmila, Sampedro and Robles eventually led to Meseguer drawing a sharp save from Bardsley.Next Linari’s sidefooted volley from a corner was cleared near the line by Tessa Wullaert and then Ludmila hesitated by the penalty spot, the opportunity escaping her with Bonner stepping in. There would be more, Atlético beginning the second half on the front foot and staying there. Ludmila, already lightning, seemed to get even faster. Every time she ran, she left opponents trailing.It was not just her, even if the inclination was to look her way. Atlético came at City from both sides. And if most of the crosses were cut out, the aerial defending determined, Atlético got closer. Ángela Sosa pulled back for Ludmila, whose header just evaded the far post before Sampedro delivered a wonderful inswinging cross. Ludmila’s header was saved by Bardsley from six yards. The rebound dropped to Jennifer Hermoso but, falling, her shot flew over.At that point it was overwhelming but City stood strong and the substitute Claire Emslie bent a shot just past the post. Atlético were tiring, the momentum slowing, but still they came. And, with time ticking away, so did the goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbba3274bf1384b0bf3492cb165e2023a6446358/0_214_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=902975a55bc4ee5d26fa8a0d33951989","title":"west ham david gold agents money football fifa uefa","story":"The West Ham co-chairman David Gold has launched a stinging attack on football agents, declaring they are “sucking tons of money” out of the game. Gold’s outburst comes after Premier League executives called for a ban on clubs paying agents.The 20 clubs collectively aired their frustration with so-called “dual representation”, whereby the agent is paid twice, once by the player and once by the club. They are understood to have the Football Association’s backing in abolishing the practice, which has led to agents being paid increasingly astronomical transfer fees.Gold, who has been joint chairman at West Ham since 2010, said: “They are starting to run football. They are certainly sucking tons of money out of football. We are all trying to pay less, they are doing nothing for football. I can’t believe it is even a discussion. Other than agents, everybody else is against them.” Asked if they were disrupting the game, he added: “That goes with the territory. They are certainly doing that.”The Premier League has also received backing for a number of other proposals it hopes will reduce the influence of agents. These include an exam, a check they have a working UK bank account and a requirement that they provide an annual financial statement to the\u0026nbspleague.The increasing power of agents has led to them becoming among the most influential figures in football. Mino Raiola, who represents Paul Pogba, earned £41m from the £86m transfer of the midfielder from Juventus to Manchester United two years ago, taking money from both clubs. Jorge Mendes, whose clients include Cristiano Ronaldo and José Mourinho, is reportedly the wealthiest agent in football and much of his money comes from fees paid by clubs.Football intermediaries collectively earned more than £220m in fees paid by clubs in England and Wales last year, including £211m from top-tier sides. Gold and other executives made a move towards abolishing completely the process of clubs paying agents at a Premier League meeting in London.“The FA certainly is line with our feelings that something has to be done,” Gold said. “From the beginning it’s not been something that we want and they don’t want. Now it’s Fifa and Uefa we need to come into line and we are hoping they come up with something.”Until 2015 dual representation was illegal in England but that was reversed when Fifa deregulated the way agents operate. HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs is also understood to be looking at the way dual representation could be used to circumnavigate tax laws.Meanwhile it is understood the Premier League has made headway on finding a replacement for Richard Scudamore, who will leave his post as executive chairman on 14 December. A list of 35 has been whittled down to a shortlist of 10 prospective candidates to replace Scudamore after 20 years in charge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b33852e0611a3f0d2cbd72a8a6defc5ee27d84a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09663ca33a7d7a2933ac7e4e2d3d5338","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Spurs’ rough month could be extended by Liverpool, another perfect record is on the line at Watford and fears for West HamSeptember hasn’t exactly been great for Tottenham thus far. Defeat at Watford was followed by landing in Barcelona’s Champions League group, Daniel Levy confirming more costly delays to the new stadium and a night in Milton Keynes. Dele Alli got injured on international duty and their captain, Hugo Lloris, was ruled out with a thigh problem shortly after admitting being two times over the drink-drive limit. Ever a man to brighten the mood, Son Heung-min returns this week fresh from pulling the nutmeg of the year, with Asian Games gold (and military service exemption) also in the bag. How Spurs need him at lunchtime on Saturday against Liverpool. For all their talents, Tottenham are not otherwise blessed with pace and despite the South Korean playing eight games in four weeks, he should be called upon by Mauricio Pochettino, who is likely to employ the same counterattacking tactics that led to a 4-1 Spurs win in the same fixture last season. MBThe encouraging part for Chelsea is how they have adjusted to life under a manager who only arrived in west London in July. But while talk of a title challenge does not feel so fanciful after four consecutive league wins, Maurizio Sarri is unlikely to fall into the trap of thinking that his new team are the finished article. “We can improve,” Sarri said after the recent 2-0 victory over Bournemouth, and it will be interesting to see if he hands Olivier Giroud his first start of the season when Cardiff City visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The France striker scored a stunner against the Netherlands during the international break and he impressed against Bournemouth after replacing Álvaro Morata. Indeed, Giroud for Morata has been Chelsea’s first change in both of their previous two matches, which suggests some fine-tuning is required up front. JSIn recent weeks Leroy Sané has been dropped by Pep Guardiola, had his attitude criticised by Toni Kroos and become a father. Sané is used to dodging opponents at lightning speed but even he has struggled with all the obstacles in his way after his stunning campaign last season. Guardiola will hope the impact of becoming a dad might help settle the Germany international, who is yet to start a game for City this season and was left out of the squad entirely for the win over Newcastle. With their Champions League campaign starting against Lyon on Wednesday, Guardiola knows he will need to instigate the squad rotation process and having Sané in optimal mood can only be a good thing for the winger and the team, with Saturday the perfect time to reignite the engine. WUAfter opting for extreme caution during his side’s defeats to Manchester City and Chelsea, there is pressure on Rafa Benítez to let Newcastle play with more freedom. There is no guarantee of the Spaniard loosening up, though. He is still unhappy with Newcastle’s transfer business during the summer and responded to criticism of his tactics by rightly arguing that he had to cut his cloth accordingly against teams as strong as City and Chelsea. All the same, there seems little need for Newcastle to remain in ultra-defensive mode when they host Arsenal on Saturday. Arsenal are frail at the back and Benítez should not forget that his side won this fixture last season. JSAdama Traoré has always been regarded as a rough diamond, lightning quick but perhaps lacking composure or an end product. Yet since his £18m summer move to Wolves from Boro, with each of his three league appearances coming from the bench, he has hugely impressed. Per 90 minutes, nobody in the Premier League has created more chances than the 22-year-old or completed even half the number of successful dribbles: Eden Hazard has 5.56 to Traoré’s 11.87. Nuno Espírito Santo has so far refrained from starting Traoré in the league, such is his ability off the bench to stretch the game and punish tired legs, just as he did at West Ham in bursting past Aaron Cresswell to score a late winner. Nuno will be pondering whether to use Traoré as a second-half weapon or start him at home to Burnley on Sunday. In a game Wolves are expected to win, this could be the perfect opportunity for the latter. MBAfter losing their first four matches, West Ham could have done without a trip to one of their least favourite grounds. They rarely fare well at Goodison Park and Manuel Pellegrini will wince when he hears that Everton have won more Premier League matches (24) and scored more goals (80) against West Ham than they have against any other team. But the Premier League’s bottom side cannot lean on those grim statistics. They have to start somewhere and Pellegrini could remove some of the growing pressure by giving a recall to Declan Rice. The 19-year-old has not featured since being hauled off during the 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on the opening weekend, but West Ham need more solidity in midfield. JSProfligacy cost Bournemouth dearly in their defeat at Chelsea before the international break but their fans still have every reason to be cheerful. Eddie Howe reportedly has his pen poised over a lucrative new deal that will double his income – with a whacking great compensation clause should he be headhunted. Rather curiously, Howe has restricted midfielder Lewis Cook to just three substitute appearances in the league this season – two of them late in a bid to run out the clock. The England Under-21s captain currently finds himself behind Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman in the pecking order, despite some bravura performances which earned him a standby call for England’s World Cup squad. Cook recently signed a new four-year deal, so has probably received assurances from Howe, but his manager’s sparing use of him in the early stages of this season remains a mite puzzling. BGStill looking for their first win of the season, Huddersfield entertain a Crystal Palace team that have lost three consecutive Premier League matches since beating Fulham on the opening day. With five goals between them across eight games, toothlessness up front is a clearly a problem, particularly for Huddersfield. David Wagner’s team have failed to score in 23 of the 42 Premier League games they have played since he led them to promotion. Following their most recent outing, a battling 1-1 draw at Everton, Wagner expressed satisfaction with his side’s “effort, performance and attitude”, but bemoaned the paucity of scoring opportunities they created. Palace’s risible league record without Wilfried Zaha in the side has been well documented, but he could return after recovering from a groin injury. For different reasons, both sets of fans will be anticipating the release of the lineups even more keenly than the kick-off that follows an hour later. BGWith Jamie Vardy’s retirement from international football highlighting England’s lack of depth in attack, the stage is set for Danny Ings to remind Gareth Southgate of his qualities. The striker has caught the eye after joining Southampton on loan, scoring two goals in his past three games, and he will be difficult for Southgate to ignore if he maintains his fine form. Injuries stopped Ings from fulfilling his potential at Liverpool and the 26-year-old’s first task is to stay fit, but he proved he can flourish in the Premier League during his time at Burnley. He knows how to find the back of the net, as Brighton could find out when they visit St Mary’s on Monday.

But not any more, as Mark Wahlberg’s ridiculously brilliant daily schedule makes all too clearWhen the famously dissolute movie star John Barrymore died, having spent much of the last year of his life passed out at Errol Flynn’s house, the brilliant character actor Peter Lorre bribed the funeral home’s director to loan him the corpse for a night. Lorre, Humphrey Bogart and a couple of others sneaked into Flynn’s Mulholland Drive home while he was shooting late, arranged the body in a chair near the bar, then hid and waited. When Flynn returned home from set, he nodded at Barrymore, and continued to walk over to fix himself a drink. After a few steps, Flynn froze. He went back to the chair, touched Barrymore’s ice-cold body, then shouted: “All right, you bastards, come on out!”I know what you’re thinking. This is all very well but did any of these ill-disciplined men make Daddy’s Home 2, Mark Wahlberg’s highly called-for sequel to his turn in Daddy’s Home? Alas not. At the time of this late-night incident, Bogart was shooting a picture called Casablanca, and though we’ll probably never know his workout schedule for the movie, I guess we can say for sure that he could bench-press at least a quarter of John Barrymore. But only after tipping-out time at the Cocoanut Grove.And so to the much-remarked-upon daily routine of Wahlberg, which is here reproduced in full:2.30am wake up2.45am prayer time3.15am breakfast3:40-5.15am workout5:30am post-workout meal6:00am shower7:30am golf8:00am snack9:30am cryo chamber recovery10.30am snack11:00am family timemeetingswork calls1:00pm lunch2:00pm meetingswork calls3:00pm pick up kids @ school3.30pm snack4:00pm workout #25:00pm shower5:30pm dinnerfamily time7:30pm bedtimeOr is it? Is that what this life is? For many, Mark’s schedule is the equivalent of letting daylight in on tragic. Once the inspiration for Entourage – indeed, that comfortingly silly series and his Calvin Klein adverts are Mark’s sole serious contributions to the culture of the past three decades – our hero now exists in a permanent state of physical readiness for creative challenges unspecified.Instead of an actor, then, perhaps it makes better sense to think of Mark as the machine on which a small community of people depend for their livelihoods. Think of him as an ancient loom, or an 18th-century plough. The contraption must be maintained at almost all costs, or the economic ecosystem collapses. Or perhaps you prefer to picture Mark as a corporation, with his abs expected to post quarterly results. And by quarterly, I mean per quarter of each day.He’s hardly alone. These days, Gwyneth Paltrow has almost stopped acting entirely, and reversed her business model into the business of what being an actor apparently entails. Which is to say, an extreme form of highly monetised physical self-obsession. There is a point where you have so many accessory muscles to target and so many crystals to place in your orifices that you literally don’t have time to look into a camera 27 times and say: “Will that be all, Mr Stark?”Looking at the physiques of a good seven of the top 10 highest-grossing Hollywood stars, including the aforementioned Mr Stark, it feels as if an actor’s tradecraft long ago shifted on its axis. The bit where you pretend to be someone else as part of an artistic project is really such a small percentage of the life that it occupies far less of the schedule than juicing. And infinitely less of the schedule than talking about juicing.It’s a real cross to bear. Almost literally in the case of Tom Cruise, whose insistence on sacrificing his corporeal self in the cause of the Mission Impossible franchise is increasingly messianic.Then there’s Daniel Craig, whose James Bond role has bafflingly yet to draw the attentions of the Victoria Cross committee. “I work myself to death,” he explained during the promotional tour for Spectre. “It’s getting harder. But such is life.” Keen not to miss out on this scintillating discussion, the movie’s actual producer gave interviews about Craig’s thighs. “He went into a six-month physical thing that really transformed his body. I’ve never seen anything like it. He must have added, I don’t know, 10 inches to his thighs and the whole chest. He actually transformed himself. And he kept at it. And he eats this scientifically controlled diet all the time, and he goes to bed at nine o’clock at night when he’s making the movies. He’s like a monk.”Yes. I think I’d rather the Russians got all of our hard drives and secret whatnots than have to listen to very much more of this. But there was more. As is increasingly common, the star’s trainer got several outings on the interview circuit himself. “As an ex-military man,” explained this chap, “I think I was uniquely placed to understand the discipline, mental strength and stamina required in order to train to become the ultimate cinema superspy, James Bond.” Thank God dear Roger Moore got out before this nonsense started. Can you imagine? What is really required to become the ultimate cinema superspy, James Bond, is the ability to turn to a snake and say “Hiss offf” (Octopussy, 1983, dir John Glen) - and you simply can’t bicep curl your way to that.Not that bulking up is new, of course. When Jimmy Stewart wanted to enlist in the US army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he found himself below the military’s required weight, and consequently embarked on a beefing-up regime with MGM’s in-house personal trainer. Clark Gable had the opposite problem, and embarked on a Dexedrine regime. Whether the cause for which they were doing all this was more important than a movie about a man who finds himself in over his head when he and his wife adopt three kids is unclear. But at least they didn’t bang on about their routines.The mistake today’s stars make is to imagine that any of this passes for conversation. It is perfectly acceptable to have a nutrition or exercise regime, and in many cases necessary. However, discussion of either is the last refuge of the most ocean-going of 21st-century bores. Should you find yourself discussing them at any length whatsoever in company, you should wake up the next morning beset by the sort of shame levels that might follow an evening of hideous drunkenness. Why did I say that? What nonsense was I blathering? Why am I such a complete idiot?If you are updating your etiquette books, then, please be advised that the old rule that you should never discuss religion or politics in polite company has dated. Both subjects are now back on the table. Their conversational-pariah status should instead be applied to diet and exercise. If someone asks you what you “do” about either, you should cock your head in a manner that implies that even the question has been a faux pas then outline your answer as absolutely briefly as possible, and ideally in fewer than 20 words then move on to topics of greater interest. Furthermore, please never refer to any form of exercise or any exclusionary method of eating as “a philosophy”. Existentialism is a philosophy. Raw food is food that has not been heated above 40 degrees. Let that clear up any persistent muddling of the two.No community needs to grasp this more urgently than celebrities. In the name of entertainment, please never speak about eating steamed fish and vegetables for dinner and drinking three litres of water each day. Please work off the principle that you are paid a lot of money, and your obligation in interviews such as this is to at least attempt, at some level, to be interesting or amusing. Remind yourself: your diet is not interesting. Your diet is – in the words of Jerry Maguire – an up-at-dawn, pride-swallowing siege that you will never fully tell us about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f82a9d71947d96bf26b31bdcea98004a965eb65a/0_176_6897_4138/master/6897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009fc61334aab38ae093d30215b43770","title":"daily mail backs theresa may brexit plan conservative mps traitors","story":"Editorial laments plotting by Brexiter Conservatives against PM as apparent ‘death wish’The Daily Mail has backed Theresa May’s plans for a soft Brexit and described Conservative MPs plotting to oust the prime minister during the negotiations with the EU as “traitors”.Geordie Greig, a former remain supporter who took over as editor from the arch-Brexiter Paul Dacre last week, appears to be shifting the newspaper’s editorial tone towards support for Downing Street’s Chequers plan.An editorial in the Mail on Thursday strongly criticised discussions by Brexit-supporting Tory MPs about May’s future as the “latest manifestation of the party’s apparent death wish”.On a separate page, Andrew Pierce’s reported account of the meeting was headlined “One by one, traitors put the knife into Theresa”.The editorial said: “The Mail has never made a secret of its reservations over aspects of the Chequers compromise. But as the talks with Brussels enter their final stages, the truth is this is the only blueprint for Brexit on the table.“The perception grows that Conservatives are too busy fighting each other to attend to the issues that affect millions – such as the surge in violent crime, recurrent train delays, long waits for GP appointments or the near impossibility of home ownership for most young families.As editor, Dacre was supportive of May but focused relentlessly on Brexit, and he has publicly warned against softening the paper’s line on leaving the EU.The extent to which the Mail’s editorials directly influence the views of the 1.3 million people who buy it every day is a matter of debate, but the newspaper’s print edition remains influential within government and among broadcasters, setting the tone of the political debate.The initial editions of the Mail under Greig appear to suggest a more nuanced editorial line, where a soft Brexit is a price worth paying to keep Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, out of No 10. The shift is in line with what Daily Mail insiders told the  last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91320933782059f01f09229ec0fd860c64b57520/178_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=f961746c782f469ee530d18a7b8aaf88","title":"fans removed dua lipa shanghai concert china","story":"Singer speaks out after Shanghai concertgoers were forcefully removed by securityThe pop singer Dua Lipa has praised her fans’ bravery after some audience members at her concert in Shanghai were forcefully removed for dancing in their seats and apparently waving flags in support of gay rights.Videos posted on social media after the show in China on Wednesday evening showed security staff pulling people from their seats and crowd members apparently being attacked by security guards outside the National Exhibition and Convention Centre.The British singer tweeted that she was horrified by the incident. “I will stand by you all for your love and beliefs and I am proud and grateful that you felt safe enough to show your pride at my show. What you did takes a lot of bravery. I always want my music to bring strength, hope and unity. I was horrified by what happened and I send love to all my fans involved.”Lipa, 23, has been vocal in her support of the LGBT community, and appeared to be upset on stage during her performance. She told the audience: “I want to create a really safe environment for us all to have fun … I want us all to dance. I want us all to sing. I want us all to just have a really good time.”Lipa pledged to return to Shanghai “when the time is right and hopefully see a room full of rainbows”.The Shanghai date was the second and final date of Lipa’s first tour of China, after she performed in Guangzhou on 11 September.Although homosexuality is not illegal in China – the country decriminalised it in 1997 and LGBT visibility has increased – there has been creeping cultural censorship since Xi Jinping came to power in November 2012.In November 2017, Human Rights Watch interviewed 17 Chinese LGBT people who said they had been pressured into undergoing conversion therapy because of family and social pressures.In April this year Weibo, the Chinese social media site, reversed its plan to “clean up” LGBT content on the platform after an online protest. In May a video showing security guards punching two Chinese women who attended an LGBT event in Beijing prompted outrage.Some fans who attended the Dua Lipa concert said people were removed for dancing, while others said some were ejected for waving pro-gay rights flags.Wham! were the first western act to perform in China, in 1985. George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley held two concerts, in Beijing and Ghangzhou, after their manager, Simon Napier-Bell, convinced Chinese officials that allowing the duo to perform would show the world that the Communist party welcomed foreigners and foreign investment. Concertgoers received a cassette tape containing Wham!’s original songs and Chinese covers by Cheng Fangyuan.Some artists have tailored their approach to profit from this lucrative market. In April the British singer Jessie J won the Chinese television talent show Singer. The Canadian pop star Avril Lavigne found success in China by touring regional cities that did not often appear on western acts’ Chinese itineraries, leading to endorsement deals with soft drinks and gaming companies.Others, however, have fallen foul of the Chinese authorities. In July last year Justin Bieber was banned from touring the country by Beijing’s Municipal Bureau of Culture owing to “public dissatisfaction” over his previous concerts in China. Other artists including Björk, Lady Gaga, Maroon 5 and Bon Jovi have reportedly been banned from performing in the country after showing their support for Tibet and the Dalai Lama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/549736ce5486b12df74210ae59af8d2a45af1efc/0_182_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1fc155b2d385262db60a47c9d2f5b8f","title":"she was on a roll the cranberries on the last days of dolores oriordan","story":"The Irish band are piecing together their final album following the recent death of their lead singer. They talk candidly about her troubled life and the challenges of working without herThe last time the Cranberries guitarist Noel Hogan saw Dolores O’Riordan was in the Limerick hotel where we are now standing, in November 2017. He had agreed to do an interview with a Chinese journalist: the band are huge in China, apparently, and had a run of arena gigs booked there. O’Riordan was living in New York and she wanted distraction she decided, in a typically whimsical move, to come to meet the journalist, too, taking the direct flight to Shannon airport. She was in good spirits, although ongoing back problems – a slipped disc, from picking up a guitar – had led to a cancelled tour that summer.Christmas came and went, but the Cranberries were still recording. O’Riordan would send Hogan vocals by email. On 14 January, she emailed him new songs: she had flown to London to mix an album with her side project D.A.R.K. At 1.12am on 15 January, calling from the Park Lane Hilton, she left a friend an excited voicemail in which she said a new recording was sounding “fucking terribly good”. At 2am, she spoke to her mother. Later that night, she died. I meet the band four days before an inquest ruled that the 46-year-old had drowned accidentally in the bath, with high levels of alcohol in her blood. Hogan looks around the lobby and says it is hard to believe that the last time he saw her it was somewhere so mundane.On the top floor, with its views out over the Shannon river, three Cranberries bear the mark of men still coming to terms with bereavement. Like many bands who lose a member, they threw themselves into activity. Their new album was nearly finished, so they completed it April and May passed by in a blur. The strangest thing, they tell me, was that working in the studio was not all that different. The three of them would always record by day and Dolores would come in to sing at night, alone, with producer Stephen Street.“We’d pass each other in the corridor,” says bassist Mike Hogan, Noel’s brother, who was only 20 when the band achieved international fame. “Dolores would say: ‘You know that thing you recorded?’ I’d say: ‘You mean the thing that took me five hours to get right?’ She’d say: ‘Yeah, it’s not working!’ This time around, there were nights when we were waiting, looking for her to come in the door.”“Waiting for her to come in, like,” echoes his brother. “I found that, at night, I was so exhausted. Not physically, but mentally those months from when Dolores passed away were intense.”The pair, along with drummer Fergal Lawler, are a close-knit circle, managed by one of O’Riordan’s five brothers. She grew up 10 miles out of Limerick in Ballybricken, but they are from the town and met when breakdancing in their teens in the mid-80s. They first saw Dolores when she was 19 and tried out for their band she was painfully shy and quiet, they all agree, but “when she sang”, says Noel, “I wondered how and why she wasn’t already in a band. I didn’t want to question it. We were lucky enough that she had come into this room.”While the four of them shared a love for the Smiths and the Cure, O’Riordan’s vocal style stood alone: it was described by a Melody Maker journalist in 1991 as “the voice of a saint trapped in a glass harp”. She learned her yodel from her dad, a country music fan, and there were church influences, too. The music mag went to her family home to meet the band and painted an intriguing, kitsch picture: a Jesus clock and holy water from Lourdes, with Christmas turkeys being bred in a shed in the dark. She adored her father, a farm labourer who was injured in a motorbike accident that left him unable to work she is buried alongside him in St Ailbe’s Church, Ballybricken.O’Riordan recalled an idyllic childhood – warm beds, hearty dinners, a fair dose of spirituality – but, in 2013, she told the Irish Independent that between the ages of eight and 12 she had been sexually abused by a family friend. Throughout her life she would flip, in interviews, between poetic positivity and confession.The heady combination of raw, emotional lyrics and evocative Irish flavours quickly caught the attention of the wider world: the very first song O’Riordan wrote for the band was Linger, and it remains their biggest hit. Although their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?, tanked the first time round, after two US tours Linger was put on heavy rotation by MTV and upon its rerelease the album went to No 1 in the UK. By 1995, it had sold 5m copies in the US. It is being reissued in a box set next month.Despite their huge commercial success, the Cranberries were never exactly cool in a UK smitten with Britpop the US was always their second home, where Irish connections were felt so strongly. O’Riordan wrote an international protest song in Zombie, her response to the IRA bombing that killed two children, Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry, in Warrington in 1993. Its lyric was so powerfully abstract that Parry’s father, Colin, only realised, on O’Riordan’s death, what had inspired it. Their label was wary of the track’s politics, but the band were not.“In the 30 years with Dolores, what she wanted to do lyrically was her thing we never interfered,” says Noel. “That first album was all about relationships that she’d had through her teenage years, and to stand there and spurt that out to everyone, you could open yourself to ridicule – but she didn’t care. That remained with her always. She wrote what she felt was right.”When fame hit, they were all about 20. It was always tougher for Dolores, says Mike, being on the front of the local paper, buying fish fingers at the supermarket. She broke her leg badly on a group ski trip during the recording of their second album – she wrote songs from her hospital bed – and, during her protracted convalescence, she began to struggle with depression and anorexia. By 1999, she was listed as the fifth-richest woman in the British Isles, but fame was wrecking her nervous system. By 2003, the band were “burned out”: they saw very little of each other for six years, with O’Riordan living in Canada with her husband, Don Burton, and their three young children. There was a reunion in 2009, but you get the sense of a band kept on their toes by an unpredictable leader.“She would say we needed some time off and a week later she would be bored,” says Noel. “Her emails were like text messages. Fifteen of them, but they’re all like two lines, at two o’clock in the morning …”“Sometimes when you did want time off you’d be dreading seeing her ringing,” his brother smiles.After her split from Burton, she spent a period living in hotels in New York. In 2014, she had a manic, paranoid episode on a flight from JFK to Shannon and assaulted the cabin crew, reminding them who she was. Shortly afterwards, she invited the Irish journalist Barry Egan into her home and told him how much trouble she was in it was a cry for help from someone who had grown up in the public eye and who possibly struggled in periods of relative obscurity. “My life has no control,” she said. Shortly afterwards, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. How much did the band know about her problems in her later years?“It was only the last few years that she started talking about psychological problems, because she didn’t know herself,” says Lawler. “She saw a few different therapists and realised what she had and she started getting treatment for it.”“She was a lot more herself,” says Noel. “Especially last year, when we were rehearsing: you wouldn’t even know, because they had found the right cocktail of whatever it was she needed to be on. There wasn’t even a case of having to ‘work around it’. The hardest thing was her back, because playing live she could not move as freely as she used to.” The new album gave her something to focus on, he says. “She was really psyched about getting back out and really looking forward to China, because that was a big tour for us.“Dolores had an awful lot going on and she was on a roll of being able to write,” he continues. “Lyrically, the new album is very strong. She always said she found it hard to write songs when she was happy. She always said: put a bit of misery in her life and it was easier.“We will do this album and then that will be it,” he adds. “There is no need to continue.”The band step out on to the balcony to do the photoshoot. Noel stood out here with O’Riordan the last time he saw her. This is new for them: no frontwoman, no idea how to stand, to pose, without their focal point.“With Dolores, doing pictures was so easy, because you knew exactly what to do,” he smiles. “Just all get behind her.”The box set of Everyone Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We? is released on 19 October on UMC. The Cranberries’ final album, In the End, will be released next year• This story was updated to correct two errors. The Aer Lingus incident occurred in 2014, not 2016. At the time of her death, O’Riordan was in London to mix a record with her side project D.A.R.K, not to record vocals for Bad Wolves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dad18be61c9ad01b32dd2a24039e9efab41924d/1654_180_3343_2007/master/3343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c39e459acb4487831ac7b68ff9ecf3","title":"the business of voluntourism do western do gooders actually do harm","story":"A holiday helping out in an orphanage can be a rewarding experience. But voluntourism supports a system that is breaking up familiesBaby rescue is the ultimate volunteer experience. At Hope of Life International, a Christian mission in rural Guatemala, a rescue team springs into action when news arrives that a baby is dangerously ill in a nearby mountain village. The mission, which hosts hundreds of volunteers from North America every month, sends a caravan of Jeeps, canoes and an ambulance to bring the child to its hospital. On the charity’s website, you can see photos of volunteers, their faces rapt with grim determination, walking down a steep mountain path or fording a river, holding tiny babies wrapped in blankets. A video shows dramatic scenes in which Carlos Vargas, Hope of Life’s founder, rescues a baby alongside volunteers, the music pulsing and urgent. “Every second, every minute matters,” Vargas says. “Maybe if we reach her an hour late, we lose her.”Hope of Life has scouts who work in these mountain villages, looking for sick infants. Although time is of the essence, when they find an ailing baby, the scouts do not bring them directly to the hospital. Instead, they alert the organisation, which assembles a team, accompanied by volunteers, to collect them. Many volunteers who come to Hope of Life are drawn by the dream of taking part in one of these expeditions: they get to save lives, and have a transformational encounter. One woman wrote in a blogpost about her experience: “This is what we came for. This is what I have been waiting for. This is what they’ve been waiting for.”Every year, millions of people from wealthy nations travel to poor countries, hoping to do good. University students want to spend a school break or part of a summer giving back, perhaps even to improve their CV. Christians go with their churches for one- or two-week missions. All seek personal growth, connection to those less fortunate, and the satisfaction of making a difference. For many, the destination is an orphanage, where they aim to bring joy to needy children in the brief time they can spare.The aspiration to help the most vulnerable children is a noble one, but the booming business of “voluntourism” sustains practices and institutions that actually do harm. There is no such thing as a “good” orphanage, according to child development experts. Eighty years of research confirms that children do best in a family. They are far more likely to experience abuse, cruelty or neglect in an institution than in any other setting. Even in a well-run facility, children do not develop normally.In wealthy countries, the institutionalisation of children has almost completely stopped. Instead, governments offer services that can help families keep children with them if that is not possible, they seek adoptive parents or foster families. These solutions are imperfect. Some foster families are abusive children, especially those most in need of a steady home, can get shuffled from one family to another. “But nobody is advocating going back to institutions,” says Philip Goldman, the founder and president of Maestral International, a Minneapolis-based organisation that advises on social welfare and child protection.Almost every poor country, by contrast, still puts children in institutions, even though the vast majority of those children have families. Wealthy countries, who consider orphanages harmful for their own children, nonetheless provide a stream of charitable giving that makes orphanages viable businesses abroad. And orphanages need “orphans”. Parents may hand over children because they have special needs, or because the family can’t afford to send them to school. “It’s a huge pull factor: if they can get food, health care, education, specialised services, parents make a decision they think is in the best interests of the children,” says Shannon Senefeld, senior vice president for overseas operations at Catholic Relief Services.In Cambodia, 40 years after the Khmer Rouge genocide, the number of orphanages has been growing, according to the UN. The reason is demand – but not from abandoned children. Instead, it comes from a huge rise in Australian tourists willing to pay to work in them.Voluntourism is an outgrowth of the ecotourism movement of the 1990s. According to Pippa Biddle, author of a forthcoming book on voluntourism, travellers rebelled against package trips and resorts and wanted a more authentic experience – and they were willing to pay for it. Many charities in developing countries run such programmes and collect fees from volunteers. “It used to be if you wanted to volunteer abroad, you wrote letters to overseas contacts,” says Claire Bennett, co-author of Learning Service: The Essential Guide to Volunteering Abroad. “Now you can buy a volunteer experience with a few clicks.” The newest trend is corporations sending employees to volunteer. It’s a team-building exercise and associates the brand with good works. Hope of Life, the Christian mission in Guatemala, has built an executive conference centre for just this purpose.Voluntourism may be fuelled by noble feelings, but it is built on perverse economics. Many organisations offer volunteers the chance to dig wells, build schools and do other construction projects in poor villages. It’s easy to understand why it’s done this way: if a charity hired locals for its unskilled work, it would be spending money. If it uses volunteers who pay to be there, it’s raising money.But the last thing a Guatemalan highland village needs is imported unskilled labour. People are desperate for jobs. Public works serve the community better and last longer when locals do them. Besides, long-term change happens when people can solve their own problems, rather than having things done for them.“There are few things more cringeworthy than watching 20 British schoolgirls trying to build a well under the scalding Nepalese heat,” one Durham University student wrote about her trip to an orphanage. Villagers, wary of offending their visitors, say nothing. An American volunteer in Tanzania recalled: “We … were so bad at the most basic construction work that each night the men had to take down the structurally unsound bricks we had laid and rebuild the structure so that, when we woke up in the morning, we would be unaware of our failure.”Defenders of voluntourism maintain that its real value is to change the visitor. But while it’s definitely more transformational for the visitor than the host, it’s not clear how significant the effects are. A study of 162 Americans who travelled to Honduras to build houses after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 found that years later, this work had made no difference to their giving or volunteering. And even if the houses they built didn’t fall over, they were expensive. The houses in Honduras built by international volunteers cost $30,000 apiece, including airfare, while local Christian organisations could build them for $2,000. If well-wishers had contributed money instead of labour, 15 times more houses could have been built. The helpful choice would have been to stay at home.Money goes far in poor countries. Two thousand dollars can pay for a week-long trip by an unskilled American volunteer – or it could pay the salary of a village teacher for four months. “If the church in the US would simply tithe, with just half that increase in giving, you could feed, clothe and medically treat the entire developing world,” says Daryl Fulp, an American missionary who works with disabled children in Guatemala.If children go to institutions because their families are poor, the solution would seem to be working to reduce poverty rather than building and funding more institutions. But institutions become the solution because governments don’t have – or are not willing to spend – money for anti-poverty work. Funding for orphanages, by contrast, just drops from the sky. In many poor countries, it dwarfs funding for every other kind of relief or development work.In Haiti, some 30,000 children live in orphanages. Lumos found that these institutions get at least $100m a year in foreign donations. That is half the total amount of US aid to Haiti last year, five times the budget of Haiti’s social affairs ministry, and 130 times the country’s child protection budget.Hope of Life, which occupies a 3,000-acre complex in the mountains about a four-hour drive from Guatemala City, is one of the biggest organisations offering an emotionally charged tourist experience. The orphanage, founded in 1989 by Vargas and his American wife, Cheryl, now houses 195 children, at least 60 of them with disabilities. Volunteers pay between $750 and $1,000 to come and work for a week: the higher sum gets you an air-conditioned suite with private bathroom. (Baby rescue is extra: one man who takes employees of his company on trips to Hope of Life told me his group pays $1,500 for a baby rescue trip.) When I visited this year, the lunch I ate was excellent, the swimming pool I saw spectacular. There’s a zoo, with a lion, tiger, crocodile and jaguar.Lourdes Milian, who manages Hope of Life day-to-day, said that during summer and school vacations, about 400 volunteers come every week, and, on average, 150 during other weeks. Volunteers, then, bring at least $9m a year to Hope of Life.Hope of Life had a budget of $15.7m in 2016, which funds its many programmes: projects in villages to dig wells and build schools, baby rescue, the feeding centre, the hospital. But when I visited, it seemed clear that not much money was being spent on its most vulnerable, disabled residents, while a lot of investment has gone towards making the volunteer experience as comfortable as possible – and as emotionally rewarding. I asked Katie Arriaza, the daughter of Carlos and Cheryl – she is president and chief executive of Hope of Life International – why they put so much emphasis on bringing volunteers to rescue babies.And yet, in a sense, a tourist event is exactly what it seems to be. Hope of Life’s baby rescue saves dying children. But it also appears to be an expensive and inefficient way to do so. On its website, Hope of Life says that the children are sick because “their parents are too poor to help them”. Instead of stepping in when a child is close to death, it would seem that Hope of Life could save more children if it simply gave vulnerable families the equivalent of a few dollars a month to buy food.Governments all over the world are eager to let foreign-funded institutions take care of vulnerable children – because it means they don’t have to. Otto Rivera, who coordinates a group of a dozen Guatemalan organisations working for children’s rights, said that Guatemala spends a dollar a day per child – and half of that goes to education. “There is 50 cents left for health, food, protection and culture,” he said. “The government has no capacity or will to have an integral vision of the rights of children.”There is no room in the budget for oversight of institutions. Cases of neglect, cruelty, sexual and physical abuse and sex trafficking are widespread at orphanages. Nowhere in recent times was this more shockingly revealed than at an orphanage near Guatemala City called Hogar Seguro.On 7 March 2017, dozens of teenage girls escaped from Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asunción (the name means “Secure Home”), an institution that housed more than 700 children, 173 of whom had disabilities. The place was a medieval hell. It had no reliable count of residents, which meant that children could disappear easily. Guatemala’s human rights ombudsman had found that abuse and trafficking were taking place. Girls said that staff abused them, raped them, took them out at night and prostituted them, but no action was taken.The girls who escaped were caught, returned and locked in a classroom overnight with just some thin mattresses. In the morning, one girl set a mattress on fire to get the police to open the door. It remained closed. Later, police and paramedics carried out charred bodies. Of the 56 girls, 41 died. The others were seriously wounded.The deaths at Hogar Seguro closed the last of Guatemala’s giant public children’s institutions. Three top officials, including the former social welfare secretary, are scheduled to be tried, beginning in February 2019. The surviving children were scattered. Some turned 18 and left the system. One child entered a foster home. Foster care is a promising new initiative in Guatemala, but when I visited, there were fewer than 40 foster families in the country – not nearly enough to cover the need. The government reported that it sent 223 children back to their families, although it was unclear whether they would get the support they might need.The inter-American commission on human rights instructed Guatemala to keep the Hogar Seguro children out of institutions, but 180 children, 120 of them with disabilities, were placed in other facilities, both state-run and some of Guatemala’s more than 125 registered private institutions (there are probably many more that are unregistered). More than 40 children from Hogar Seguro ended up at Hope of Life.In March, Lisbet Brizuela of Disability Rights International (DRI), an advocacy organisation based in Washington DC, took a small team around Guatemala to visit the places now housing Hogar Seguro’s disabled children, to check on their care. They visited 11 public and private institutions. In one Catholic children’s home, Albergue del Hermano Pedro, Disability Rights found four teenagers lying on mats with their hands tied behind their back, in what was called the rehabilitation room. At Virgen del Socorro, another Catholic home, girls were held in cages. All children with disabilities were tied to chairs or wheelchairs, even those who could walk.I went along on some of the DRI inspections. We visited two new state-run group homes for boys and young men with mental disabilities. They were obviously much more humane than Hogar Seguro – but they were chaotic, impersonal and lacking stimulation. Children from Hogar Seguro had survived terrible trauma. We saw plenty of psychiatric medicines, but no sign of trauma care.At Hope of Life, the most severely disabled children live together in a building called Kelly’s House, with four rooms, each with between eight and 11 children. There they sleep and spend most of the day, in the care of two staff members a room. Three of the rooms house kids who came from Hogar Seguro. Some are sitting in wheelchairs, some are rocking or walking back and forth. The rooms have cribs and some beds but are otherwise bare. There are few toys, almost nothing on the walls, nothing for children to look at or do, although Arriaza, the chief executive, told me there was a day in the past two months when the children were able to play with small animals, such as rabbits.Volunteers have reported concerns. One mission volunteer at Hope for Life wrote on a church blog: “The more time I spent there, the more my heart broke for these special needs kids. They need more trained carers, physical therapists and speech therapists. But as it is now, they are understaffed and the staff they have is not educated enough to handle the children they care for. Kelly’s House has a lot of great equipment that has been donated but it is sitting unused because they don’t have professionals to teach them to use it.”Arriaza said that a therapist would be coming soon from the US and would stay for a month, teaching the staff new techniques for helping the children. I asked how much stimulation the children received. “We have cognitive therapists who play with colours and different things,” she said.One Guatemalan government official – a woman highly respected for her seriousness and dedication – had told the DRI inspectors before their visit to Guatemala that the government was launching an innovative way to care for some of the children, along with some adults, with mental disabilities. In Quetzaltenango, a four-hour drive from Guatemala City, we visited this new government care initiative, called Nidia Martínez, and were disappointed to find it was another institution. The land it was built on had become available, we were told, and it was decided that building a new care home was easier and faster than setting up any kind of family-based structure. Housing a child in an institution costs six to 10 times as much as family-based care, but setting up the necessary support for families requires dedication, know-how and planning.The Nidia Martínez buildings were new, clean and spacious, with 80 beds. The rows of bunk beds in the girls’ room had pink Disney princess blankets. The residents were dancing to music (perhaps for our benefit). Most of the staff had come from Hogar Seguro. It was impossible to tell how implicated they had been in what went on there, since there has never been any investigation.The medical expert on the DRI inspection team was Matt Mason, clinical director of the Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development. I asked him how many of the children we saw could live – if they had help – with their own or other families.“All of them,” Mason said.When I was 16, I worked for a summer at St Francis Home for Orphan Boys in Detroit, as part of a Jewish youth group, 10 teenagers from all around Michigan. St Francis was a forbidding, five-storey brick building. I helped care for a group of boys aged eight and nine. My job was to offer them inidual attention. I spent much of the day taking long walks around the grounds with one boy at a time.As at other institutions, my boys were not orphans. On the weekend, many got visits, and some went home. Some had behavioural problems that their parents couldn’t handle. In other families, their parents had the problems and lost custody as a result. In both cases, the boys needed help. As far as I remember, they got no treatment whatsoever for their problems. Some of the boys came from families that were simply poor. One boy was at St Francis with his younger brother because their father, who worked at the Ford plant, was alone and could not afford childcare.At the end of the summer, as teenagers do, I cried about whether I had made a lasting difference in their lives – and as teenagers do, I wrote poetry about it. One boy, Rodrick, had given me a ring of his own making when I left. This was part of one of my poems:I still have the ring, a circle of wire I sometimes wear. But what do you still have of me to tell you that I once was there?I now understand that I did leave Rodrick with something: a sense of abandonment. Every single boy in that institution already had abandonment issues. If it was hard for me to leave these boys behind, how much harder was it for them to see me go? And the next adult who came for a few weeks? And the next one? They might have learned that there are people who love them and will take them on walks. But they also learned that these people always leave.St Francis closed in 1992. The United States doesn’t use orphanages any more. Nor does Britain. No matter how well-run the orphanage, it cannot provide what children most need: a parent. When volunteers turn up at an orphanage and children run to hug them, it’s understandable that they feel they are providing much-needed love and attention. But children shouldn’t turn to random strangers for affection. When they do, it means they can’t develop healthy attachments. And a parade of short-term adults to hug them makes it worse.What puts children in crisis isn’t something hugs can solve. Andrea Freidus, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina, wrote that voluntourism gets in the way of recognising the structural issues that create humanitarian crises. “My research suggests that students who engage in these programmes actually contribute towards the mystification of larger systems that produce inequality, poverty, particular patterns of disease distribution and various forms of violence.”In a 2012 essay on what he dubbed “the White Saviour Industrial Complex,” the novelist Teju Cole pleaded for humility. It is “not about justice,” Cole wrote. “It is about having a big emotional experience that validates privilege.” Voluntourism, he argued, perpetuates the myth that change happens as a result of expressions of caring from rich white people.Romania, infamous for keeping many thousands of children in institutions during the Ceauşescu years, has now greatly reduced its institutionalisation of children. So have Bulgaria and China. A consortium of Lumos, Maestral and Catholic Relief Services is starting to work in Haiti, Guatemala, Lebanon, India, Kenya, Moldova and Indonesia to help these countries move from institutional care to family care.Sudan, where civil war has left many children without protection, has created a system of emergency foster care and adoption. Rwanda aims to have zero children in institutions by 2020. It has turned orphanages into day-care centres and retrained staff as day-care workers. It supports and monitors families who take in children. “Rwanda is a poster child for de-institutionalisation,” says Philip Goldman at Maestral. “They have placed four out of five children in safe, nurturing, monitored homes.”Almost all of the children who remain in institutions in Rwanda are disabled. Families abandon these children because they might require unaffordable equipment or medicine. They might need care that a working parent cannot provide. In some places, disability is seen as a curse. Once institutionalised, a disabled child almost never leaves.The support and monitoring required in family care is more challenging to set up than placing a child in an orphanage, and far harder for children with disabilities. “I don’t think that’s impossible,” says Shannon Senefeld, from Catholic Relief Services. “But it requires case management for each inidual child.” And it requires families willing to care for children with complex needs. “The government cannot create those families by fiat,” says Jedd Medefind, the president of the Christian Alliance for Orphans, a group that seeks to direct short-term church missions towards family care instead of orphanages.Such families do exist. Daryl and Wanda Fulp, Christian missionaries, came to Guatemala from Ohio in 2007 to adopt their son John – their third adopted child with special needs (they also have five biological children and two adopted children they had fostered). During the trip they visited an institution for disabled children and left weeping at the conditions they saw. They sold their possessions in Ohio, moved to a large house outside the city of Antigua and began taking in children with severe disabilities, including those near death.The Fulps’ Hope for Home feels like a chaotic, giant family doing what it can for 25 children with disabilities. Caring for any of them could be a full-time job. Local authorities call frequently asking them to take new children, and they have no reliable source of funds. The place runs on the family’s faith – the Fulps’ adult children and their spouses make up a lot of the staff – and on Daryl’s charisma and energy. But even he sometimes seems overwhelmed by the need, and the deaths of so many children.The Fulps’ pioneering work aims to help families keep their disabled children at home. Because so many children are disabled due to cerebral palsy, which can result from injury during birth, in August Hope for Home opened a birthing centre, run by a midwife who is training other midwives. Hope for Home also has three teams of people, who visit some 150 families with disabled children. Donors – mainly Christians in the US who follow Fulp on his blog – sponsor the families, providing between $10 and $200 a month to cover what the family needs.Families get free monthly visits from a nurse and from a physical therapist who trains them to do therapy with their child. They get free medical appointments with private doctors, transport to appointments and whatever else they need to keep their children: special formula, medicines, wheelchairs, leg braces. Crucially, Hope for Home also provides food for the whole family if needed – thus turning a disabled child from a serious economic liability into a modest asset. Disability Rights observed that keeping children in institutions costs the state more than 15 times what Hope for Home pays to keep children with their families.In March, Lisbet Brizuela of Disability Rights and I went to see the family of 14-year-old Walter, who has spina bifida, hydrocephaly and hearing loss. His mother said that until Walter was six, the family carried him everywhere. But then they met Fulp, who brought Walter a wheelchair. When Walter outgrew the first chair, Fulp brought him a new one. Fulp has brought braces for Walter’s feet and treatments for pressure sores. He is also paying school fees.That day we also saw Sayli, who was 14 months old. Fulp had met her 10 days before, and recognised the signs of cerebral palsy. It is hard to imagine a family less equipped to deal with a child with her complicated needs. Sayli lives with her mother, Yulisi López, 20, her grandmother, 42, and six of López’s young siblings. They all live in one room and sleep on one mattress. Only two of the school-age children go to school. Sayli was thin and sickly, and suffered from frequent respiratory infections. A week before our visit, Fulp had brought special formula for Sayli. He also brought a laundry basket containing 18kg of food: dried beans, rice, corn flour for tortillas, oatmeal, powdered milk, sugar.Fulp told the family that Sayli had an appointment with a neurologist, and he had arranged transport for her and her mother. “My friends will come here and get you, and then bring you back home,” he told López. He said he understood they were devastated by the news about Sayli’s condition, but promised to find a sponsor to supply the $80 a month the family needed to stay together and survive. He prayed with them. “The good news is we’re going to walk with you,” he told the family. “You are not alone.”Organisations around the world have been working for years to end orphanage tourism. Their work is starting to bear fruit. Australia is now discouraging the practice, and the Australian parliament is considering a law to label orphanage tourism as child trafficking and ban it entirely. In July, the UK international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, announced that the government’s foreign aid programme would now support family- and community-based care for all children. In May 2016, the London School of Economics set up a consortium of universities pledging not to advertise orphanage placements to their students.Many major tourism companies – for example, Global Crossroad – still prominently feature orphanage work. Nancy McGehee, a professor of hospitality and tourism management at Virginia Tech University, says that companies send representatives to speak on campuses. But some companies are closing their voluntourism programmes. The International Volunteer HQ announced that it would stop sending volunteers to orphanages by March 2019. Projects Abroad stopped in January 2018. “I don’t think we’ve lost any business from it,” says Jessi Warner, chief operating officer of Projects Abroad. “Quite often someone will phone and say: ‘I want to work in orphanages.’ When our team explains why we don’t do that, everyone is open to it. They often join our community care programmes. It’s just about awareness.”Some religious groups are also trying to channel efforts into family and community care. The Catholic church has set up more orphanages than any organisation in history, but is now changing its policies. “We recognise we were part of the problem and we had to really work to change,” says Senefeld. The Christian Alliance for Orphans recently published a guide for short-term volunteers working with children. It advised groups running trips for volunteers to commit to the best interest of each child first, over the visitors’ emotional needs. Jedd Medefind, the president, said that volunteers could switch from directly caring for children to supporting local caregivers. It’s a question of managing expectations, he said.“This is a huge, committed, passionate, motivated population willing to do just about anything to care for these kids,” says Nicole Wilke, research fellow at the Christian Alliance. “These people are not the enemy. They are the solution here. If we don’t want them going into orphanages, what do we have for them?”For some people, the answer might be nothing. “We are competing with that incredible emotional reward of walking into an institution and having 10 kids jump into your arms,” says Goldman, of Maestral International. “It’s something very difficult to replicate.”McGehee at Virginia Tech would like to see voluntourism recast as “transformational tourism”, with visitors rewarded by gaining a better understanding of people’s lives, and the way the economics of charity work. By all means, visit people who need help, she says. “But do it beside me and hear who I am. Get to know me and not all those stereotypes about me. And then go home and see if there’s something you’re doing that somehow perpetuates my situation.”Support for this article was provided by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b271e6a09385f3efe71df623c1e02475792edd/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18b89e2358b07a5394ee3a1889492b64 2020w","title":"tory meps criticised by jewish and muslim groups for hungary vote","story":"Conservatives tried to oppose European parliament vote to trigger disciplinary procedures against HungaryJewish and Muslim leaders have criticised Conservative MEPs for voting against measures to censure Hungary, saying it was deeply worrying that they had declined to condemn the repressive policies of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán.The European parliament voted on Wednesday to trigger the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedures due to policies in Hungary to reduce judicial independence and boost control over the media, as well as concerns about corruption.It was the first use of a so-called article 7 procedure against a member state, which could, if pursued, see Hungary stripped of its voting rights in the EU. It was narrowly passed by the necessary two-thirds majority, with the Conservatives almost alone among centre-right parties opposing it.While the Conservative group argued the plan was counterproductive and would strengthen Orbán domestically, the Board of Deputies of British Jews (BoD) and the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemned the decision.Marie van der Zyl, president of the BoD, said it was “very concerning that Conservative party MEPs chose to defend Hungary’s appalling track record rather than supporting a motion to uphold the rule of law”.She said: “As we have stated previously, we are very alarmed by the messages at the heart of Orbán’s election campaign, including his comments about ‘Muslim invaders’, calling migrants ‘poison’, and the vivid antisemitism in the relentless campaign against Jewish philanthropist George Soros.“This whipping up of prejudice by the Hungarian government, alongside restrictions on press freedom and the independence of the judiciary, must be stopped before it undermines Hungary’s democracy irreversibly.”The MCB’s secretary general, Harun Khan, said: “At a time when there are growing concerns about the rise of the far-right across Europe, it is deeply disappointing that Conservative party MEPs were whipped to align themselves with far-right parties in supporting Mr Orbán.“One can only hope that the rights of Muslims and other minorities are not considered expendable as support is sought for the government’s Brexit position, as appears to have been the case with this vote.”He added: “The Conservative party has thus far resisted calls to have an inquiry into Islamophobia amongst its ranks. This latest action raises further concerns of bigotry in the party.”Khan said that the MCB “would like to specifically pay tribute” to Nosheena Mobarik, the one Conservative MEP who backed the motion.Downing Street has argued that MEPs make their own decisions, distancing itself from the move.Tory MEP Daniel Dalton tweeted that the vote against article 7 was “not an endorsement of Viktor Orbán”. His message was retweeted by Ashley Fox, leader of the Conservative delegation in the European parliament.Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister should speak out on the issue. He tweeted: “The Tories brought shame on the UK by backing Hungary’s far-right government in a crucial vote in Europe. Theresa May trying to sweep it under the carpet is disgraceful. The prime minister must apologise and explain why her party voted in the way it did.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44e70b853fe295bdc8675bc74a9be21c1f048e8/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=079f82e06405eb32e20c9f10dbe4f380","title":"the feline timeline a history of cats from ancient egypt to instagram","story":"Celebrated and persecuted in equal measure, cats have been with us since the dawn of civilisation, featuring in verse, literature and film. Kate Wills explains why cat history is our historyThere is a saying that “nobody owns a cat”, but archaeological remains suggest that wildcats have been slinking inside huts for treats and strokes for around 9,000 years. Scientists recently discovered that all of today’s domestic cats descend from one subspecies of African wildcat, and that our ancestors could be ided into cat or dog people as early as the stone age.Perhaps the ultimate “cat people” were the Egyptians, who worshipped our feline friends to such an extent that they imposed the death penalty for killing one, shaved their eyebrows in grief when theirs died, and had them mummified and placed in purr-amids in readiness for the kitty afterlife. For ancient Romans, Felis silvestris catus was a symbol of liberty and an effective form of pest control. It was cats’ mice-bothering skills that allowed them to pad across Asia, where dedicated mousers protected silkworm cocoons and treasured manuscripts from rodents.The middle ages were a bit of a low period in the history of catkind, as felines were cast as symbols of “sinful” female sexuality and witchcraft by the church. In Malleus Maleficarum, the medieval treatise on witchcraft usually translated as The Witch Hammer, a 13th-century folk story depicts three witches that turn themselves into cats and attack a man. From then on witches were believed to have cats as sidekicks, or to change into feline form in the night. But by the 15th century, cats were coming back into favour, helped in part by the legend of Dick Whittington, who made his fortune thanks to his rat-killing kitty. This kitty may or may not have worn boots in real life – and may or may not have sounded like Antonio Banderas.It was around this time that cat-fans started breeding moggies for particular coat colours and textures. Kitty genetics is a fascinating field. Cats come in two dominant colours – black and red – that are “diluted” or “masked” to become “blue” (appearing grey) or “cream”. The red colour is only carried on the X chromosome, which is why tortoiseshell cats are nearly always female, and ginger cats are nearly always male. (This is all great trivia with which to impress your cat-loving andor geneticist friends, by the way.)There have been many “crazy cat ladies” – and gentlemen, for that matter – throughout history, notably Cardinal Richelieu (AKA the baddie in The Three Musketeers), who had 14 cats at the time of his death in 1642, including Ludovic le Cruel, so named because of his savage dedication to killing rats. Catherine the Great of Russia turned the Winter Palace into a cattery, with her favoured breed of Russian blues running wild upstairs and a basement full of “working cats” that she promoted to guard status, complete with salaries and extra food rations. Winston Churchill kept cats at Chartwell, while Abraham Lincoln was such a cat obsessive that he fed his kittens Tabby and Dixy at the table at a state dinner, and regularly took in strays to the White House.As cats became a popular indoor pet – no doubt helped by the invention of cat litter in 1947 – they clawed their way into popular culture, too. Whole essays have been written on the cartoon cat, from Sylvester the Cat, who first appeared in 1939, right up to Pokémon’s Meowth, via Felix, Top Cat, Garfield, Bagpuss and the Aristocats. Not to forget Alice’s Cheshire Cat, which also appeared in cartoon form in the 1951 Disney film.In a nod to the feline’s medieval association with evil, cats also became the purr-fect accomplice for witches, Bond villains and, in homage, Mike Myers’s Dr Evil. They were also the animal ally of choice for breakfasters at Tiffany’s, the alien-battling Ripley in the otherwise very non-furry Alien films, and leather-loving Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman herself in Batman Returns.But it’s the internet that has taken cats from much-loved pet to feline overlord. From “I can has cheezburger” memes to Grumpy Cat, via the 52 million people who have watched a ginger cat called Fatso play a keyboard, Brits share 3.8m cat pictures and videos every day. Meanwhile, social media has made stars of some pampered pusses, such as Karl Lagerfeld’s fluffy white Birman, Choupette (112.4k followers), Kitty Purry (Katy Perry’s cat) and Taylor Swift’s two cats, who now have their own merchandise line, the Meredith and Olivia Swift collection.But before memes there was poetry. In the ninth century, an Irish monk wrote a poem about his cat, Pangur Bán. For Baudelaire, the cat’s meow was the very source of his verse. When Romantic poet Robert Southey’s cat, Rumpelstiltskin, finally went for his great catnap in the sky, Southey wrote: “There should be a court mourning in Catland.” Meanwhile, Thomas Gray was composing an Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes. If only they’d been alive in 2002, when the first cloned kitten – the aptly named “CC” – was born.And while Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story Cat Person could stake a claim, the most famous feline work of literature has to be TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. Fitting, then, that Andrew Lloyd Webber’s record-breaking 1981 musical version is about to get a big screen reboot, starring – who else? – contemporary cat woman Taylor Swift.

Here’s what your cat’s age really means – and how to handle the changes that come with itOnce kittens pass the newborn phase, where they should be with their mothers, and begin to grow and engage with the outside world, they will discover play. Kitten play mimics moves that would be used for hunting such as stalking, ambushing and pawing. Help your kitten hone these skills, which also keep them active, by making time to play with them using age- and size-appropriate toys.TrainingToilet training should start using a size-appropriate litter tray as soon as your kitten comes home. Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat.

Ministers hope extending the practice to restaurants and takeaways will allow the public to make healthier choices.“Eating out has become the norm, meaning around a quarter of our calories come from food on the go, restaurants and takeaways,” said Dr Alison Tedstone, the chief nutritionist at Public Health England.“Clear and visible information at the point of choice is important to help us understand what we are buying and to make healthier choices. This will help protect children from obesity and future ill-health.”The plans are part of the government’s strategy to halve childhood obesity by 2030. The strategy includes a proposed ban on the sale of energy drinks to children and a consultation on whether a 9pm watershed should be imposed for junk food advertising.Steve Brine, the public health minister, said: “Families want to know what they are eating when on the go, but in many cafes, restaurants and takeaways this information is not available.“This is not about forcing anyone to eat certain things, or companies to behave in a certain way. But I firmly believe we have a right to know the nutritional content of the food we give to our children. Type 2 diabetes is on the rise, and is often both preventable and reversible. That’s why we are taking action through this consultation, and I would ask everyone to respond with their ideas on how we can make this work.”The charity Diabetes UK supports the plans, and highlighted the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related illnesses and conditions cost the NHS an estimated £6.1bn a year.Helen Dickens, assistant campaigns director at Diabetes UK, said: “People living with diabetes and more than three-quarters of the British public have told us that they want more information about what’s in the food and drink they buy, to help make healthier choices – especially when they’re out and about. These bold, ambitious proposals from government are – if put into legislation – essential to making the healthy choice the easy choice for British consumers.“The UK is facing a type 2 diabetes crisis. With around two-thirds of adults in the UK classed as overweight or obese, and therefore at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and other chronic health conditions, it’s really important that we have measures in place that make it easier for all of us to lead healthier lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a53c6be4d023f1f78961c588cef6641a6a84f15/179_345_4843_2905/master/4843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee3b1ea5ae5dbc8d1faef9867be0d097","title":"great britain cameron norrie dan evans davis cup  ennis scotland finale uzbekistan","story":"• Injuries force Great Britain’s hand before era-ending tie• Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot face Uzbekistan at doublesIt is simultaneously fitting and sad that Great Britain’s last match in the 118-year-old history of the “old” Davis Cup before the competition morphs into a global experiment of high-risk proportions in 2019 should be in Glasgow this weekend, scene of the team’s finest recent moments.Evans, 222 in the world after an encouraging 40 matches since returning in April, beat some decent players to win a Challenger in Vancouver last month before doing less well in Mallorca and France. He said: “I didn’t play so good the past two weeks … probably shouldn’t have played, went straight from Canada to Mallorca – just been trying to get as much tennis as possible. I feel like I’m playing pretty good again.”He will need to against the best Uzbek of them all, Denis Istomin, who turned 32 during the US Open, where he went out in straight sets in the first round to the American Steve Johnson.Cameron Norrie, at No\u0026nbsp70 the highest-ranked British player available, then faces Jurabek Karimov, the world No 434.Norrie brings with him a flat New Zealand drawl – a legacy of growing up there – a dry sense of humour and a father with what he calls “a filthy Scottish accent”.Istomin, who plays the doubles on Saturday with Sanjar Fayziev against Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot, nearly got Uzbekistan into the world group in 2012, leading them to wins over New Zealand and India before they lost to Kazakhstan in the final play-off. So here they are again, in their 11th attempt at cracking the big\u0026nbsptime.Not so for Great Britain, of course, the 2015 champions who are assured of a place in the new competition, where the best 18 countries will play each other in a round-robin format in Madrid or Lille in November 2019.Soon enough those moments will be wrapped up as memories. Jamie’s brother, Andy, thought long and hard before deciding he could not interrupt his training schedule to take part in a tie in which Great Britain are favourites. But he will miss the noise as much as anyone.Jamie Murray, meanwhile, joined the chorus of support for Carlos Ramos as the official of the moment prepared to go back to work in Croatia’s home tie against the United States in Zadar after upsetting Serena Williams in the US Open final at the weekend.“I think that’s a bit far-fetched,” Murray said of the American’s claim after losing to Naomi Osaka in straight sets that Ramos was being sexist for docking her a game in the second set after she called him “a liar” and “a thief”.Speaking to BBC Sport, Murray said: “I think the umpire did what was within his rights. Coaching is common. A lot of people are doing it. Some people aren’t getting called for it. To get called in a grand slam final was perhaps a bit tight, but I think the reaction was pretty overboard. I’ve seen a lot of people get called for coaching before, and you might have a grumble and stuff, but you get on with it.”Others who have defended Ramos include Billie Jean King, who was the driving force behind the formation of the women’s tour and equal pay, the American-Czech legend Martina Navratilova, whose 18 slam titles Williams heads by five and who has had her own battle with prejudice over her sexuality, the United States Davis Cup team captain, Jim Courier, and one of his players, Steve Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9240851e385151c09e8f5783b91a388e06168eac/141_504_3803_2282/master/3803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ad7fa831102ecfb9f39f8bf4ac8bf44","title":"lewis hamilton f1 singapore grand prix fashion","story":"• Mercedes driver has travelled to Milan Shanghai and New York• ‘I get a lot of energy from these different things that I do’Lewis Hamilton has insisted he is as focused as ever on his task of winning a fifth Formula One world championship.The Mercedes driver arrived for this weekend’s Singapore Grand Prix after an exceptionally busy two weeks since his victory at Monza, launching his new fashion line with Tommy Hilfiger. Hamilton, who has a 30-point advantage over Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari at the top of the world championship standings, believes his interests outside racing – far from a distraction – ensured he is able to bring his best to the track.After winning the Italian Grand Prix the 33-year-old has travelled from Milan to London, Shanghai and New York for a series of events to promote his line of clothes created in partnership with Hilfiger. Seven races remain in the world championship and his Mercedes team expect Ferrari and Vettel to have the upper hand under the lights of the Marina Bay circuit. However, busy as he has been for the past two weeks, Hamilton was emphatic he had not sacrificed any attention to the day job.“From experience I’ve been able to move around even more than I have these past two weeks and still arrive and be able to switch into race mode,” he said. “There’s not a single moment during those two weeks that I’m not thinking about racing, not thinking about the championship, how I want to arrive. Make sure, knowing that we’re coming to a difficult race, that you need to see if you can bring more. There’s not a moment that I don’t think about it.”The British driver has won three of the last four championships and has been open during that time regarding his pursuit of other interests including music and fashion but believed they had not been a hindrance. “I get a lot of energy from these different things that I do,” he said. “I find it stimulating and I think you’ll see that my results have shown that for the past several years.”He has won six races to Vettel’s five this season including three of the last four and, despite Ferrari enjoying a power advantage over Mercedes, insisted he and the team would not adjust their strategy. “At the moment there’s no reason to change,” he said. “There are a lot of points still available so the approach is exactly the same as it has been all year long.

A champagne cork went off somewhere in the crowd. A coterie of loyal Surrey fans gathered by the pavilion roaring their appreciation, and the locals clapped out a respectful applause.It was Surrey’s first title since Adam Hollioake’s men grabbed the pennant in 2002, one also won with a bunch of local boys. It was the first time Surrey had won nine games in a row since 1957, when Peter May was captain. And it was the first title under the captain Rory Burns, county cricket’s leading runscorer and an enigma yet to be called up by England.A game that was turned by a devastating spell of bowling by Morkel on Wednesday evening still had a few twists on a day that dawned milky-blue and startlingly bright. With Worcestershire desperately needing a win in their battle against relegation, it was a fight to the end. Mark Stoneman fell first, having won the race to 50. Yet it was Burns who looked the more complete player, whose idiosyncratic head tick, whose deep knee bend as the bowler approaches, have made no impact on his delicate touch or his ability to leave the ball.The script seemed written for him to hit the winning runs but he was bowled by a jaffa from Pennington, Worcestershire’s teenage bundle of elastic who prospered for England in the Under-19s World Cup last winter.Pennington had a spell of his dreams from the Diglis end. His rapid run-up, accelerating to the point of delivery, and so tall that his trousers finished quarter-mast above his ankles, kept Surrey guessing. He followed up the dismissal of Burns with the wicket of Ollie Pope and 32 still needed after the batsman had driven and cut him to the boundary in the same over before he got one that zipped through low.When he had Tom Curran caught gloving a rapid riser through to the slips, the improbable seemed possible, but in the end Worcestershire did not have enough runs, notwithstanding Surrey’s middle-innings collapse of five for 50.Outside the Graeme Hick pavilion Burns, in socks and sandals, with a large bottle of Moet tucked between his feet, grinned. “I’m not sure I watched any of it,” he said. “I was sitting there looking at Instagram, having a coffee and trying to keep composed. Now we’ve got over the line I feel I can enjoy it a little bit. We’ve been building up for this for quite a while. It’s the Championship, the one everyone wants to win.“Surrey boys winning the title for Surrey is what we want to do. I’ve been associated with the club personally since I was eight or nine. It means a lot.”For Burns there was the added satisfaction of passing 50 again. The chatter of him filling Alastair Cook’s shoes has grown to a bellow but Burns knocked inquiries away. “I’ll keep trying to let the bat do the talking.” Has he heard from the England selectors? “There’s no indication at the minute of anything but that’s how it is.”The director of cricket, Alec Stewart, was brought in by Surrey in 2013, a year after the tragic death of Tom Maynard, when, in his own words, “things were struggling”. He wanted time and the suits gave it to him. “Things don’t happen overnight. I wanted to be patient, and the chief exec and chairman were patient for me. You can buy it in but I didn’t want to do that.Stewart also had words of comfort for the home side: “I hope that Worcester stay up. They also show that, if you produce your own, they fight together.”On the balcony, on the outfield, the players made merry: there was Rikki Clarke, the human mountain range brought back by Stewart despite his age Morkel, lanky and devastating, 50 wickets at 13.96 Stoneman, another Stewart addition who overcame doubts after his troubles with England and Pope, the future, talent personified.There were also the experienced Dean Elgar and Jade Dernbach, plus raw talent in Ben Foakes, Will Jacks, Tom Curran, Amar Virdi and Burns himself, the only player to make a thousand runs in the championship.And as the crowd of little over 400 drifted away, the strains of Erasure’s A Little Respect came blasting out from their dressing room.Respect. It is something this team deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2e9fc6bed03d054b4b468b6b4813f0da65d77d1/288_154_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6daa25f41cf03785bb1754f5b2448749","title":"worcester cornell du preez unable to talk throat injury rugby","story":"Cornell du Preez, the Worcester and Scotland back-row, has revealed he is unable to talk and must remain in hospital for the next four weeks as a result of the serious throat injury he sustained on the opening weekend of the Premiership season.

While it’s good to see a radical comedy resurrected, and the result is an evening of lewd fun, the show never seems sure how far to go in giving a neglected classic a contemporary bite.The piece sticks closely to the original structure in which a dynamic Athenian leads the city’s women in staging a coup d’etat. Not only that: she proposes a form of economic and sexual communism in which property is shared along with all forms of physical pleasure. While attacking the corruption of governments run by men, Aristophanes leaves open the question of whether he is endorsing or satirising this envisaged utopia.You could offer a straight version of the original or rewrite it totally in terms of today’s world: this version seems torn between the two. It retains Aristophanic gags such as a young man, here played by a woman endowed with a vast, banana-shaped phallus, being fought over by a group of randy oldsters. At the same time, it makes reference to living figures, advocates that sex should be a public service like the NHS, and suggests that crap jobs will  be done by robots.While I’d like to have seen a more ruthless update, Blanche McIntyre’s production and Jasmine Swan’s design, with its fibreglass columns and pillars, create a fantasy Greece and the six-strong cast – Lydia Rose Bewley, Elizabeth Boag, Anna Fordham, Lisa Kerr, Alicia McKenzie, Anne Odeke – are brimful of energy. Tim Sutton’s songs also embrace everything from Hamilton-style hip-hop to parodic Broadway melodies.But since the team of seven writers – Wendy Cope, Jenny Eclair, Suhayla El-Bushra, Natalie Haynes, Shappi Khorsandi, Brona C Titley and the MP Jess Phillips – includes a parliamentarian, I’d have been intrigued to see a version in which modern Westminster is taken over by women. The show is rude and raucous and even includes an onstage defecation, but sometimes falls between two stools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72b5119300b533ac7709d032c21d8b1daeb1b6b8/0_326_4510_2706/master/4510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=473dc7ae34d45f017768ed26cf72c5e3","title":"heathers the musical review teenagers revenge","story":"Theatre Royal Haymarket, London Defanged for darker times, the cult 80s high-school revenge saga homes in on the universal agonies of growing up and outsmarting bullies‘Have you had a brain tumour for breakfast?” “What’s your damage, Heather?” and, most of all, “Well, fuck me gently with a chainsaw!” The 1980s produced plenty of catchphrase-heavy movies, but none were quite as kitschy as the 1988 cult film Heathers. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, both absurdly beautiful and cool, played teenage misfits Veronica and JD, who – at his instigation – kill off the popular bullies at school, embodied by a trio of girls each called Heather. Unlike other sepia-tinted teen movies of the era, Heathers had a cartoonish yet ironic nastiness to it. It was also made when the idea of high-school students shooting people in a school cafeteria seemed absurdly fantastical.For all of these reasons, Heathers is an unlikely movie to turn into a stage musical. Films adapted for the West End are the new jukebox musicals, stories seeking out songs as opposed to songs in need of a storyline. But Heathers is a very different beast from, say, Dirty Dancing and Legally Blonde, both of which were made into successful musicals. (Heathers the Musical co-writer Lawrence O’Keefe also co-wrote Legally Blonde the Musical.) The story is more surreal and savage. To get around this, O’Keefe and co-writer Kevin Murphy largely defang their source material. Many of the movie’s more interesting ambiguities are removed – Veronica (played with energetic sweetness by Carrie Hope Fletcher) doesn’t deliberately kill anyone, JD (an excellent Jamie Muscato) is more creepy than cool. Kids die on stage, but this is treated with a Little Shop of Horrors-esque campiness as opposed to the movie’s gut punch. Halfway through, I wondered why O’Keefe and Murphy had bothered remaking Heathers instead of one of the paler, simpler movies it inspired – Mean Girls, for example. Then I realised Mean Girls had already been turned into a musical, too.A show should not be hamstrung by its origins the only thing that matters is whether it works on its own terms, and the answer here is: kind of. Heathers surprisingly, and thankfully, plays down the 80s setting, opting for a more universal sense of teenage life, with all its bullying and neuroses. The audience – who all looked as if they were born at least two decades after the movie came out – shrieked with joy throughout. (If jukebox musicals are for baby boomers, musicals inspired by films are emphatically for their children and grandchildren.)This musical justifies its existence best when it goes to weird extremes, such as when a bitchily disdainful Heather Chandler (Jodie Steele, who comes close to stealing the show) haunts Veronica after she is killed off. The music is so generic it falls out of your memory as soon as you leave the theatre, with the exception of two lovely ballads: Seventeen, in which Veronica pleads to be a normal, non-murdering teenager, and Freeze Your Brain, JD’s paean to the frozen slushies that help him numb his feelings (“Freeze your brain!  Suck on that straw, get lost in the pain  Happiness comes when everything numbs  Who needs cocaine?”). In such moments, Heathers nails what made the movie so great, and goes even deeper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a9d11323ef606dc186c0ccac546ac635667fdc/59_0_3313_1988/master/3313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1d86178f012123ac98cdcd52bb316d8","title":"amazon jeff bezos philanthropy day one fund","story":"Amazon CEO will launch $2bn fund to help homeless families and low-income communitiesAmazon chief Jeff Bezos is launching a $2bn fund to help homeless families and build a network of preschools, saying the “child will be the customer” in his philanthropy announcement.The tech founder and the world’s richest man unveiled the Bezos Day One Fund on Thursday. He said he would fund existing organizations that aid homeless people and pledged to build new not-for-profit schools to serve low-income communities.“We’ll use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon. Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession,” he wrote on Twitter. “The child will be the customer.”Bezos, whose fortune has risen $64.7bn in the last year, has long faced scrutiny for his lack of a major philanthropic initiative and last year tweeted a broad “request for ideas” for a “philanthropy strategy”.Bezos’s estimated net worth is more than $163bn, and Amazon recently became the world’s second company to be valued at $1tn – but Bezos has faced increasing pressure to improve working conditions and wages at his warehouses.Earlier this year, Amazon was accused of treating warehouse staff like robots in the UK, after reports surfaced revealing that ambulances had been called 600 times in the past three years. There were also recent allegations of an increase in health and safety complaints from exhausted workers on Prime Day, when the company promotes a wide range of deals.Some critics have argued that Amazon has become the world’s largest online retailer through opaque tax arrangements, and that the company should not be getting valuable tax breaks and should be subject to corporate wealth taxes. Amazon vigorously fought a tax to fund affordable housing in Seattle where it’s headquartered.Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, faced renewed calls for him to improve his labor practices and increase his philanthropy after he told an interviewer: “The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. That is basically it.”Bernie Sanders has escalated criticisms of Bezos and his labor practices in recent weeks, tweeting: “Count to ten. In those ten seconds, Jeff Bezos, the owner and founder of Amazon, just made more money than the median employee of Amazon makes in an entire year.”Khanna praised Bezos’s “entrepreneurship and commitment to philanthropy” in a statement to the  on Thursday.But Khanna said: “The biggest statement Mr Bezos could make is by raising the pay of workers in his own company. Philanthropy will not solve income inequality or stagnant wages. Raising wages like Henry Ford did in 1914 would make a dent.”Bezos, who is worth nearly as much as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett combined, said his “families fund” would issue annual leadership awards to civic groups doing “compassionate, needle-moving work to provide shelter and hunger support to address the immediate needs of young families”.His “academies fund” would “launch and operate a network of high-quality, full-scholarship” schools in underserved areas, saying he would “build an organization to directly operate” the preschools.Tech billionaires’ efforts to improve education in America have had varying success. After Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged $100m dollars to schools in New Jersey, some local leaders said it was ultimately a failed effort. Research also found mixed results."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaf92face9ef2b0159998001fb456088cbd0f3cd/0_983_4478_2688/master/4478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2da1845609370198b358c38c5f2ab9cd","title":"is there a cheap windows alternative macbook user apple","story":"Bernadette is a writer, photographer who can’t afford a new Apple laptop. Is there a lightweight and affordable replacement out there?I need a new lightweight laptop, as I travel a bit, but cannot afford a Mac at this time. I already own an iPad (and an iPhone) but the screen is too small for hosting group meetings. Also, I am a writer and photographer. What would be your suggestion for a lightweight, value-for-money laptop that won’t take me too far from the facilities of an Apple product that I’ve been accustomed to using for many years. BernadetteIf you’re a happy long-term Mac user then I recommend you stick with Apple. There’s not a huge amount of difference between MacOS and Windows 10, but you will have built up years of experience and “motor memory” reactions that you will lose if you change operating systems. Also, while Windows 10 does a reasonable job of working with smartphones, you will lose the integration that Apple provides between iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and iCloud.And while MacBooks still cost more than mainstream Windows laptops, the saving may not be compelling if you view it over the life of the machine.For example, let’s imagine that you would be happy to pay an extra 50p per day for the pleasure of staying with Apple. If you amortise your laptop purchase over three years, you could afford to pay a premium of £390 to buy a MacBook Pro (assuming a five-day working week). If you reckon you could make it last five years, you could justify a premium of £650. Of course, this argument is moot if you don’t have the cash.The obvious alternative is a refurbished or secondhand MacBook Pro, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. The drawback is that only old Macs are cheap. A MacBook Pro from, say, late 2016 could still cost around £1,000, and you could buy a new 13in MacBook Air for that.With Windows 10, the advantages include touch screens, the ability to run tablet apps, pen operation, logging in with face recognition using Windows Hello, and the “tent mode” you get with laptops that have 360-degree hinges.Not all Windows laptops have all of these features – they add to the cost – so it would be useful if you could try them in advance to see which ones would work for you.Of course, the iPad Pro offers some of them. However, a Windows 10 machine like a Microsoft Surface Pro offers all but one (tent mode) as well as the power of a MacBook in a single device.A Surface Pro – alternatives are available from other suppliers – should also work well for a writer and photographer. You can run full Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with a mouse or touchpad, do editing and annotation with a pen, then use it like a tablet for viewing or showing images. You can also handwrite notes in OneNote.Some iPad apps are becoming available in MacOS, but Apple is still in denial about touch screens. I’ve been using them for six years now, and when I use a laptop that doesn’t have touch, it feels backward and broken.Mac-like laptopsAsus stands out as the Windows PC manufacture with the most Mac-like products. Its manufacturing arm, Pegatron, has been a contract manufacturer for Apple and Microsoft so it knows the business. (Both company names are derived from Pegasus, the flying horse.) Asus Zenbooks tend to be better made and have screens with better colour gamuts than many alternatives, but may cost more as well.The obvious laptop for your purposes is the 14in non-touch Asus UX410UA-GV544T, which is “crafted from solid aluminium” (but not a unibody design) and available in Quartz Grey or Rose Gold. The current version has a 2.2GHz Intel Core i3-8130U with 4GB of memory and a 256GB SSD. The screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels (Full HD). The price from Asus is £643.89 (or 12 monthly payments of £56.96), which is around half the price of a 13in MacBook Pro with a seventh-generation Core i5 and 8GB.The Asus UX410UA is the same as the Asus UX3410UA, while the Asus UX410UQ models have Nvidia 940MX graphics chips. The UX430UA models are newer, slightly thinner and a little more expensive. The UX490UA is the deluxe version. Any of these would do the job.The main drawback is the 4GB of memory, but the Argos Q\u0026ampA says that you can upgrade it, and this has generally been the case with UX410UA designs. However, there is only one memory slot, so you’d have to ditch the 4GB installed to fit 8GB or 16GB.I’m less concerned about the 128GB SSD because you can slot in a cheap 64GB or larger SD card to store photos and presentations.Second hand?The best alternatives to MacBook Pros – Dell’s XPS 13 and 15, Microsoft’s Surface Pro and Surface Book, Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon etc – are obviously out of your price range. However, have a look at the Tier1Online and Morgan websites for deals on refurbished ThinkPad X series Ultrabooks. Prices vary according to age and condition. I didn’t see anything I’d recommend at the time of writing, but you might get lucky. A Surface Pro 3 or 4 would also be a good option, but certified refurbished models can be quite hard to find. You could try eBay, but battery life isn’t guaranteed, and changing Surface Pro batteries is not a simple task.Have you got a question?

The letter was likely passed on to the FBI because the bureau is responsible for background checks into judicial nominees.News of the letter came as Judge Kavanaugh faced fresh scrutiny about his relationship with another judge, who was forced to resign from the bench last year.“I have received information from an inidual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court,” Feinstein said in a statement.“That inidual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities,” she said.A source who said they were briefed on the contents of the letter said it described an incident involving Kavanaugh and a woman that took place when both were 17 years old and at a party. According to the source, Kavanaugh and a male friend had locked her in a room against her will, making her feel threatened, but she was able to get out of the room.  has not verified the apparent claims in the letter. It is not yet clear who wrote it.A spokesman for Feinstein declined to comment. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.While additional details about the letter were scarce, two media outlets have reported that the person who wrote the letter is being represented by an attorney, Debra Katz, who has been described in media reports as Washington’s #MeToo lawyer.Katz has not responded to a request for comment from the . BuzzFeed reported that she was seen on Capitol Hill on Wednesday night, shortly after the Intercept first reported the existence of the letter.Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the high court would tip the balance of the supreme court to the right, affecting policies from reproductive rights to climate change.As theories swirled in Washington about the contents of the Feinstein letter, Kavanaugh was facing fresh scrutiny about his relationship with Alex Kozinski, a powerful federal judge who was forced to resign from the bench after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual harassment and assault.Kavanaugh worked as a law clerk for Kozinski in 1991 and maintained a relationship with the onetime chief judge of the US ninth circuit for years.He testified under oath at Senate confirmation hearings last week that he was “shocked and disappointed” to learn about allegations of sexual misconduct against his former boss and friend. Kavanaugh said the news was like a “gut punch”.But Kozinski’s alleged victims have said that his allegedly abusive behaviour, which included inappropriate touching and showing clerks pornography that he kept on his computer, was openly known in legal circles.One victim who came forward as part of the #MeToo movement and asked not to be named in an interview with the , said the words “open secret” did not begin to describe the fact that Kozinski’s allegedly abusive behaviour was common knowledge in legal circles.The person said she had no knowledge about what Kavanaugh might have known, but said: “It was wide out in the open. It is hard to overstate how sexualised and abusive it was, emotionally and psychologically.”She added that “everyone knew Kozinski was a creep”, but that the behaviour was tolerated.“No one saw it for what it was,” she said.Heidi Bond, a novelist and former computer clerk in Kozinski’s office whose pen name is Courtney Milan, has alleged that Kozinski showed her pornography on his computer on several occasions, and would ask her if it turned her on.In a tweet on Wednesday, Milan expressed incredulity about Kavanaugh’s written responses to questions, although she has also said she had no knowledge of what Kavanaugh may have known.A judicial panel opened an investigation into Kozinski last year but then closed it after he voluntarily resigned, saying it lacked the authority to do more.Among the allegations against the former judge are complaints that Kozinski circulated raunchy and offensive emails with clerks, friends and associates, in what was known as the Easy Rider Gag List. When news of the existence of the email distribution list first broke in the Los Angeles Times in 2008, it emerged that the inappropriate emails were sent periodically to friends, associates, law clerks and fellow judges on the federal bench, as well as attorneys and journalists.At the time, Kozinski’s own lawyer defended the gag list, saying that it did not interfere with the judge’s ability to fairly decide cases.Kavanaugh has said under oath that he could not recall whether he ever received any sexually inappropriate emails from Kozinski. He has not responded to several requests from senators that he refresh his memory and check his previous emails to see if he was on the gag list.There is evidence that the gag list was widely distributed. In its 2008 article about the list, Paul Cappuccio, a Kozinski protege who worked as general counsel for Time Warner, told the Los Angels Times he had been added to the list, and had assumed his name was on it because he was a former clerk.Kavanaugh told senators in written responses that he contacted the disgraced judge after the allegations emerged last year, in order to check on the judge’s mental health. He also acknowledged receiving emails from Kozinski to his White House email address, indicating that the two kept in touch when he was working for the Bush administration.Asked whether he ever referred clerks who wanted to work for the circuit judge, Kavanaugh said: “In my capacity as a law professor, it is possible that I talked to students who had applied or were interested in applying to clerk for Judge Kozinski, and assisted them.”Kavanaugh is expected to be confirmed by the Senate in the coming weeks, despite a strong campaign of opposition by Democratic activists and progressive groups who say he represents a threat to reproductive rights and other progressive causes. Democratic senators are still seeking to stall his confirmation, however, by raising questions about his truthfulness under oath.Kavanaugh is not the only high-profile official to have clerked for Kozinski. Alex Azar, who now serves as the Trump administration’s secretary of health, and who is a close personal friend of Kavanaugh, also worked as a clerk for the judge in 1991 for six weeks. A spokeswoman for HHS told the : “The secretary had no knowledge of any circumstances that led to the later alleged sexual misconduct by Judge Kozinski, nor did he witness any sexually inappropriate behavior during his clerkship.”At the time of his resignation, Kozinski said he had a “broad sense of humour” and candid nature when speaking to males and females. He apologised to clerks who had been made to feel uncomfortable, saying it had not been his intention. He also said he would not fight the allegations against him reported in the media, because it would harm his “beloved federal judiciary”.The Senate judiciary committee announced on Thursday that it would hold a committee vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination on 20 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d197a232e9fd2bde9b6bd55e4c2f3e8949477d46/0_642_4302_2582/master/4302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfdfa890fffd46c845c8fcf44275d4c5","title":"massachusetts gas explosions","story":"Local police chief says 60 to 100 fires are burning in the area and several people have been injuredScores of Massachusetts residents are evacuating their homes as dozens of fires rage following a series of natural gas-related explosions.State police said troopers and emergency personnel from across Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire are at 70 locations in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover after gas explosions rocked the area. They continue to respond to fire, explosions and reports of gas odors.Officials are asking residents that have the Columbia Gas company service to leave their homes and to try to shut off their gas lines if they can safely do so.According to the Methuen police chief, Joseph Solomon, 60 to 100 fires are burning across the area and several people have been injured. Officials said four victims are being treated at Lawrence general hospital for injuries.Lawrence mayor Dan Rivera said “over-pressured gas valves,” caused the explosions. Officials said up to 10 firefighters were taken to the hospital with minor injuries. It was unclear if those firefighters were included in those being treated at Lawrence hospital. Two of those victims are in critical condition.Rivera said south Lawrence is being evacuated. Police say more than 50 fire vehicles have responded to blazes, along with almost a dozen ambulances. Local news media have shown photos of a home on its side strewn with debris. Police have confirmed there were injuries on site.Andover is about 26 miles (42km) north of Boston, and Lawrence is 29 miles (46km) north-west.Lawrence city councilor Marc Leplante told the : “It’s just wall to wall fire trucks from all over and rows of ambulances and command trucks.”Andover fire chief Michael Mansfield said that a total of 35 fires were put out across the town, and that “at least three people have been injured in Andover, including one firefighter and at least two civilians”. He said the fires were gas-related and have all been extinguished.National Grid has shut off all power to the three municipalities.Columbia Gas posted a response online four hours after the first explosions that said:, “Crews are currently responding to reports of multiple fires in Lawrence, MA. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by today’s incident.”Rivera chided anyone who has gas in south Lawrence who plans on remaining home. “If you haven’t evacuated, you gotta go,” he said. “If you stay at your home, you’re gonna be at risk. Get out of your house and go north of the river.”Republican governor Charlie Baker said the emergency response has been “adequate,” but a lot remains to be done. He said the focus this evening will be to find shelter for those displaced.Amtrak has cancelled trains from Boston to Portland, Maine and is bussing passengers.North Andover town manager Andrew Maylor said in a press conference that “no timeline has been set” on when residents with natural gas can return home. He added that at least 12 houses were affected.Tyler Medeiros, 24, was sitting on his back patio in North Andover when police sirens started to go by. One of his toy poodles began barking shortly after. A neighbor ran over and said: “Tyler, you need to get out of there now. We need to evacuate.”They ran around the corner, and there he saw a home, two away from his own, engulfed in flames. Medeiros grabbed only medications for himself and his dogs, and “got the hell out of dodge,” he told the .“The chief of police came to my street and said, “You all need to leave now.”’ The streets were filled with running people, helicopters in the sky, and he said: “The entire town smelled like gas.”He added: “I’m hoping for the best. Things can be replaced but people can’t.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cdb81b6bcb744df023a048d749282943cb9928e/0_121_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66fd8b8195d641523426c62a9798f2da","title":"new york cynthia nixon andrew cuomo governor democrats","story":"‘Don’t believe the polls’: challenger sure she can pull off an upset as other insurgent leftwingers have doneNew York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, will face off in a primary against challenger Cynthia Nixon today, in the latest test of the wave of progressive challengers who have taken on establishment Democrats across the US.Nixon is an activist – and an actor, best known for her role on Sex and the City – who has hammered the two-term Democratic incumbent on political corruption, including the conviction of a former close aide, and the sorry state of New York’s mass transit system, which has deteriorated under Cuomo’s tenure.But Nixon believes she can pull off an upset like other insurgent challengers have in Democratic primaries this year.“Don’t believe the polls, don’t believe the hype. We have a chance to strike a blow for real progressives,” she said on Tuesday on WNYC radio.Cuomo’s campaign suffered a series of missteps over the last weekend of the race. He hosted a marquee event, headlined by Hillary Clinton, to mark the opening of a new bridge named for his father, former governor Mario Cuomo. But the  did not open as planned, as engineers said the old bridge could collapse and endanger the new one.Cuomo also drew criticism for a mailer sent out by the state Democratic party linking Nixon to antisemitism and falsely accusing her of supporting a movement to boycott Israel. The party expressed regret, and Nixon slammed it as the “worst kind of dirty politics”.Cuomo, who four years ago won by an unexpectedly small margin over another challenger from the left, has moved to the left on several issues – backing the legalization of marijuana and signing an order to restore the voting rights of paroled felons.Once reluctant to attack President Trump by name, he has also made the case that he is the best person to fight back against the president.“Washington is trying to take us in one direction, and New York is going in the opposite direction,” he said this week at a Buffalo campaign stop. “This president has brought an attitude and philosophy to this country that is exclusionary, that is isive, that is bigoted, that is sexist, that is racist.”At their sole debate, tensions between Cuomo and Nixon boiled over. At one point Cuomo barked: “Can you stop interrupting?” at Nixon, who snapped back: “Can you stop lying?”Many observers believe the lopsided polls may not reflect the state of the race. “I don’t believe any of the polling. I just don’t believe it,” the city council speaker, Corey Johnson, said on Wednesday. “There’s no way to make a prediction.”The winner of the Democratic primary will face the Republican Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess county executive, in November.Down the ballot, the Brooklyn city councilman Jumaane Williams is challenging Cuomo’s lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul. Williams has a base of support in Brooklyn’s black community and has won some endorsements that Nixon did not, raising the possibility that he could win and leave Cuomo with an antagonist as his number two.The attorney general’s seat is also up for grabs, after Eric Schneiderman was forced to resign over allegations of violence against several women. Public advocate Letitia James, law professor Zephyr Teachout, represenative Sean Patrick Maloney, and attorney Leecia Eve are competing for the spot.Also closely watched in New York will be the fate of New York senate candidate Julia Salazar, and a group of Democrats in the state senate who allied with Republicans and helped give them control of the chamber. The members of the now-defunct group, called the Independent Democratic Conference, all face strong primary challenges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc3baba7128d9f8ca256b0665b94c7d5957e9e2/230_433_5328_3197/master/5328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88265d5ffb3a77aa73f7bd35815af28e","title":"american town launches uranus examiner newspaper missouri","story":"Missouri town’s mayor has threatened a boycott, saying it puts the city up for ridiculeFor many in the town of Uranus, Missouri, the title of the town’s new newspaper is taking some time to digest.This week publishers announced the launch of the Uranus Examiner, a new local paper in Pulaski County in the southern US state. It quickly became the butt of controversy, flushing out critics who wasted no time attacking the new title.According to local media reports, the town’s mayor, Luge Hardman, threatened to boycott the paper after its launch.“No. I’m sorry. But the innuendo of that title puts my city up for public ridicule, and I will not be a part of it,” Hardman was quoted as saying.A rival news publisher, Darrell Todd Maurina, also found the name hard to stomach, saying it “does not indicate a serious newspaper”.Despite straining relations with local authorities, the paper’s managing editor, Natalie Sanders, believed the name had a ring to it.“We had thought about constitution, but most of the people who love us, and who were part of coming up with the name, liked the examiner better,” Sanders reportedly said.It was unclear if other titles – such as the Uranus Express, Bugle or Mirror – were considered.The paper – which will be published weekly – replaces the defunct Waynesville Daily Guide, and will ensure a paper of record can continue to investigate local issues in Uranus.“It’s a weekly. It’ll come out, we’re thinking Thursdays, although the production schedule isn’t set yet because we just decided this and we’re still working out the kinks,” Sanders told local media.Located about five miles from the city of Waynesville – which has a website containing warnings about the release of natural gas – Uranus has become known less as a town than a series of extended puns.Its tourism website states that “there’s a lot to do in and around Uranus”, and local sites include a fudge factory and a competitive axe-throwing facility called the Axehole.In 2017 the St Louis Post-Dispatch described Uranus as “a strip mall gone delightfully, disgustingly wrong – or right”.The first issue of the paper is expected to be printed near the end of October, with distribution of about 15,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c71ac73c4a185b3e4818e65e15baa8c46b1a1a9f/1594_0_2656_1595/master/2656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c29d1ad0fe1f472cca79450387e18b5","title":"brexit worries from the irish border a panoramic photo essay","story":"Amid the growing tensions over Brexit and the border, photojournalist Charles McQuillan met people whose work takes them across the frontier. Many expressed fears about the future and the possible return of old isionsCharles McQuillan, a freelance photographer with the news agency Getty Images, used a panoramic film camera to shoot these images. He then built a darkroom in his garage to process the films. He says: “The most problematic issue with photographing the border is that there is nothing there to photograph. With that as a starting point, the basic concept for the picture essay was to show that uninterrupted space, and to include people who have a direct relationship with the border. And, more broadly, to show them in the landscape with the expanse of the open countryside around them and their place in it. The nothingness of it.“One of the privileges that comes with being a photographer is that it allows you access to people you would not necessarily meet, and it was difficult not to be moved by Betty, Eamonn, John, Brian, Emma, Johnny, Vincent, William and Catriona as I listened to their concerns about Brexit. Each of the subjects photographed were grateful for being allowed a voice, something many people in the province feel they no longer have.“My own memories of the border and the checkpoints are somewhat distant, but I can recall sitting on the back seat of my mother and father’s car wondering whether the raised hand of the guard would either beckon onwards or to stop. The mundaneness of the various checkpoints across the north, the armed soldier with his weapon trained on the car, all seem to have merged into one memory now. When stopped at the border, the question to my father was always the same: ‘Where are you coming from, sir, and where are you going?’ I can’t remember my father ever declaring anything.”Catriona attends nearby St Mary’s college in Derry. Her journey to and from school threads through the border.She says: “Ireland’s economy cannot afford to make the border anything more than it already is today – an invisible line that separates the country. At most, we will have checkpoints which will take a great step back into the past of Northern Ireland. My biggest fear is that it will damage my future education through travelling to university, affecting my pathway of study.”Farmer and landowner, Florence CourtThe popular boardwalk on the farmer’s land allows thousands of tourists to walk across the border every year as it meanders between County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland.A member of the Border Communities Against Brexit group, Sheridan predicts the UK will lose much of its wealth and status after Brexit. He says: “There is no such thing as a soft border. Over time, it will become a hard border by layer upon layer of legislation. The only practical solution I can see is to have the border in the Irish Sea.”Vice-chair of Newry Chamber of Commerce and TradeMarmion, who has two young children, owns a human resources business with offices and employees in Newry in the north and Dundalk in the south. She recalls recently explaining to her eldest child, while they were riding their bikes, that she was unable to use the road they were cycling on when she was young because of concrete blockades placed there by the British army. She says she has no idea what the border will look like after Brexit. “That’s the scary part – nobody knows. My greatest hope is that it would be ision-less and prosperous, not just for business and trade but for the navigation of everyday life.”When asked what concerns her most, Marmion says: “That the border would look like it did when I was growing up: restrictive and fearsome. Absent of both the freedom of movement and unlocked opportunity that my children deserve – and that I have enjoyed since 1998.”McKeegan crosses the border several times a week as he attends to the recently deceased from both sides of the frontier. He says: “If the politicians were children you would give them a smack and tell them to get their heads together to sort it out. There’s no reason in the world that they can’t come to some common-sense agreement. In relation to my sensitive line of work, can you imagine waiting in a queue at the border with family sitting in cars behind you as you carry their loved ones home? It’s undignified. You just can’t close the border off with a brick wall and red tape.”Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care, which is based in the Republic of Ireland but has access to nearby health facilities in the north. Without access to the new radiotherapy unit in Derry, which the Irish government invested in, cancer patients in Donegal face a five-hour journey to Galway.When asked what she thinks the border will look like post-Brexit, Holmes says: “There will be a serious ision of people who have lived and worked closely together for many peaceful years. Long queues, angry people, loss of jobs, missed appointments, flights and a younger generation who can’t understand why. They will now bere introduced to a time when hate and bigotry were rife and the possible return of paramilitaries. My greatest fear after Brexit is the serious loss of access to cancer services for Donegal patients at Altnagelvin Area hospital in Derry. Without these patients, the North West Cancer Centre will not have the critical mass to sustain the services needed for cancer patients in Derry and the surrounding areas.”McKevitt recalls how, in his youth, IRA snipers would shoot at the customs post from the hills, pictured behind him. He was sent by his parents to the US to avoid getting caught up in the violence that engulfed the province. His fireworks, gardening and fuel business sits on the land the former customs post used to occupy.He says he has many concerns about Brexit. “My greatest fear is of the government taking my land away with the return of the customs post. I’ve built up all of this and worked hard, what would I do then?”As a business owner whose oyster farm straddles both sides of the border, Lynch will be particularly affected after Brexit. He faces tariffs to ship his oysters outside of the UK to nearby Donegal, and indeed the rest of the Europe. He says: “I worry that we will return to the bad old days. I remember the border growing up as a child quite vividly, and I remember the two customs posts sat only a few yards apart from each other, and that you couldn’t cross the border after 10pm without special written permission from the guards.” To further complicate matters, the UK government claims jurisdiction over Lough Foyle to the high-tide mark, while the Irish government disputes this.Clifford, who lives in the Republic of Ireland, owns a fast food stand that trades along the border to lorry drivers transporting goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.He says: “I don’t know what’s going to happen after Brexit, no one does. My biggest fear is that I will lose my job, my livelihood, everything – and that, at the finish of it, the Troubles will come back.”Kilkeel is home to Northern Ireland’s largest fishing fleet. Cunningham is concerned that could soon change. He says: “My biggest fear is displacement of fishing effort. We traditionally fished in the bay of Dundalk, a few miles along the coast, but we’ll no longer be allowed in there. It’s a disaster for the inshore fishing fleet.“There are 40 small boats in Kilkeel harbour that seek shelter through the winter from the prevailing south-west winds. When Brexit happens, where will they go? Small boats exposed 12 miles out to sea, that’s life or death stuff. That’s not bullshit, that’s reality.”McQuillan says: “The portraits could have been shot digitally and much more simply with a wide-angle lens. However, the perspective would have become warped. Whereas a panoramic camera avoids curvature if positioned correctly, offers less distortion and is much truer to the eye with its even horizon and straight lines. Shooting film again for the first time in almost 20 years would also give the photographs a different look and feel to modern digital cameras, with the colours saturated and borrowed from a different time. However, the film came at a premium, with the size of the panoramic negative only permitting four exposures per roll.“The panoramic cameras, a Fuji GX617 and a Noblex u150, brought unique challenges. Focus could only be accurately accomplished with the aid of a tape measure. Flash could not be synced to the Noblex because of its rotating drum lens. To further complicate matters, fingers placed incorrectly when holding the camera would fall into frame if not careful. This was something that only became apparent when I was confronted with the negatives in the darkroom, which I built in a corner of the garage to iron out the camera’s idiosyncrasies and quirks. The only downside to shooting on panoramic format was having to go back to what once seemed a full-frame digital camera. I found that the view was much more restricted than had appeared before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95c3bdff1401558903334495e41ec6d9a4f4365/0_114_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a91b070152f987267ea9f2a1ef5b7491","title":"north carolina rices creek hurricane florence","story":"Residents of Rice’s Creek – population just 27 – face a potentially life-and-death decision to evacuate or stay in their homes in rural North CarolinaOn a map, the tiny “town” of Rice’s Creek, half a dozen trailer homes named after the body of water they sit by, doesn’t exist. If Hurricane Florence inflicts the damage it is expected to through its storm surge and flash flooding, it may also cease to exist in a real-world sense too.With a population of just 27, the tight-knit North Carolina community started off the week united, promising to weather the storm together on low-lying ground by the creek. By Wednesday afternoon, though, John Silvy’s daughter called him from Athens, Georgia, demanding he come down and bring her two young brothers to secure ground.“If it was just me ’cause I got good friends here, I would stay. I wouldn’t be worried about it. We look out for each other. The kids are my bigger concern,” the 50-year-old father of seven said as he walked over to his neighbors’ house for an impromptu visit in the front yard.Rice’s Creek is technically in Winnabow (population 6,000) in Brunswick county, which is under a mandatory evacuation and a state of emergency. People in mobile homes have also been asked to evacuate. But for these friends and neighbors, that’s a double evacuation order most are not heeding.That might be a life and death decision.The creek, where Silvy’s kids swim, was already higher than usual and overflowing its banks. The low-lying area – a resident estimated it to be a couple of feet above sea level – could make the hurricane a significant threat to those who choose to stay. Unlike the much wealthier, more established neighborhoods on nearby Wrightsville Beach, there’s no police checkpoint in Rice’s Creek to make sure people follow curfews and evacuation orders.Disappointed his neighbor is leaving, Alex Tatum, Silvy’s neighbor on one side, nursed a Yuengling beer, and walked over to his neighbor to justify his staying. A resident of the self-proclaimed town for more than six years, the commercial fish business owner has covered the windows on his wooden double wide trailer home with plywood and intends to stay.“All we got is our work and money. And our house,” he said to his girlfriend of one year, Mandy Dreeland, trying to convince her that staying was the best option.She wasn’t buying it. “Even if the storm shifts, we’re not escaping it,” she responded from a chair on the porch, continuing, “When it rains, the water comes up to the mailbox.”Dreeland cut him off. “And he wants to stay.”The two continued for a few minutes, mentioning snakes and the baby alligator spotted in the green-watered creek the other day.Planning to live days, if not weeks, without electricity, 26-year-old Tatum and Dreeland, 27, spent $600 on batteries, tortilla chips, Pringles, potato rolls, flashlights, tuna, chicken and rice soup, Gatorade and beer to survive in potential darkness after Hurricane Florence’s looming wrath. Their dog, Bella, is prepared with her own set of supplies. But what Tatum, 26, hesitated to buy last week may force them to flee at the last minute.Across from Tatum and Dreeland’s four-bedroom, right next to Silvy’s white wooden home, Raymond Hill’s home sits under a canopy of pine trees. He has already sent his wife to his daughter’s home five miles away on potentially drier ground.Hill won’t be joining her. “It’s mine,” he laughed, leaning on the patio with his bottle of 7Up, pointing towards his home from his porch, “and I paid for it.” More importantly, he added, “We keep a small dog and our dog is like our own young’un.”Shelters are out of the question. Hill, shaking his head, ticked off a list: “I don’t need a generator, I don’t need gas, I’ve got lanterns, I’ve got everything I need. And my wife made sure I had canned food and food in the freezer.”The curly white-haired grandfather explained why he should stay by describing a litany of previous waterlogged incidents that left the community in one piece, albeit soggy.Not wanting to be outdone, other neighbors shared their rising water stories. Tim Buck, in a black Harley-Davidson shirt and a bandanna wrapped around his head, unlocked and whipped open a shed to show a line marking how high the water had been on 21 September 1999, just days before Hurricane Floyd.“This high,” hunching down to measure nearly four feet, Buck guessed. Oh, he’s not leaving, he confirms, standing on the boat dock over the water, but he has put two motorcycles on higher ground away from the neighborhood.“I’m staying because I have everything invested in this little place right here. When you get to 60 …” he started to say before cutting himself off. Then, “Hell, I’ve probably nearly drowned twice already. I couldn’t swim a lick.”Buck does have two trucks ready to get him and his wife out if the water rushes up, but that’s too far to think about until it happens, he said. “As long as it don’t take me and my family, I can part with tools and vehicles.”Tatum agreed with his neighbor, except that he has spent $25,000 renovating his hardwood-floor-and-white-cabinets home this year over four months, only to be faced with his home being potentially turned into kindling. That’s why he has to stay, to make sure the house is OK, he repeated, a mantra.Nobody in this row of neighbors has flood insurance, they realized, while standing in Buck’s yard drinking beers. They were silent for a moment before Tatum asked to borrow Buck’s coolers to fill up with ice and hopped back on the golf cart with his stepdad.The final shared words that night among the group were nonchalant but also a warning.Tatum’s stepfather started to drive off, stopped the cart and turned to Buck, “Let me know if you’re staying so I know who to look out for here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d4d98f92b0cd54ac604bdd63585e45a52a2fe2/0_19_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8659ed267eeb4d96a7184ce4c6f121e7","title":"florence hurricane latest live news updates weather path storm surge north carolina","story":"Florence is pushing towards a landfall and beginning to lash the central seaboard with damaging winds and storm surge The National Weather Service branch in NewportMorehead City, which is on the coast of North Carolina and bracing for the full impact of the hurricane, has shared a video of furious rain outside their office early tonight.The North Carolina Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice has evacuated several thousand adult and juvenile offenders and staff from facilities threatened by the effects of Hurricane Florence.More than 3,000 offenders have been relocated from facilities in the path of Hurricane Florence. Four county jails have also been evacuated with more than 300 offenders housed temporarily in state facilities.A news release from the ision Wednesday said all adult offenders affected by the move will be allowed to make a free phone call to a family member over the weekend.The ision said leaders made the decision earlier in the week to evacuate three juvenile detention centers and relocate inmates to inland facilities within the system. Officials said 26 youth were moved and their families notified.The news release said all offenders will be moved back to the affected facilities once the storm subsides and it’s deemed safe for operations to continue.The number of people affected by power outages in North Carolina has increased to more than 102,000, according to Emergency Management North Carolina.The areas most affected are Beaufort, Carteret, Craven, Onslow and Pamlico.More information about power outages, as well as road conditions and evacuation routes can be found here.The governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, has urged people to share a list of shelters that are open across the state. There are more than 130 shelters currently operating in North Carolina, most of which have been set up in schools. That list can be seen here.The Weather Channel has put green screen to pretty extraordinary use, as they attempt to show what it could look like for people who encounter floodwater reaching nine feet, as is predicted in some areas.The good stuff begins 40 seconds into the video, skip ahead to that.A tornado warning has been issued for parts of North Carolina until 7am EDT Friday.This is Kate Lyons, taking over from Sam Levin.The National Weather Service are reporting that, as was the case with Hurricane Harvey last year, so much rain is predicted to fall as a result of Florence that they have to use an updated colour scheme in their rainfall graphic. Last year, so much rain fell during Hurricane Harvey, which caused catastrophic flooding across Houston, that the NWS had to update their colour charts in their graphics to map it effectively, adding a bright purple to show 20-30 inches of rainfall, and a lilac colour to indicate greater than 30 inches. Previously, the top band of rainfall shown in their graphics was 15-20 inches, represented by a dark purple. The NWS have said that they have been forced to use this updated colour scheme again as “Florence is forecast to bring a large area of rainfall of 20-40 inches” to both North and South Carolina. They add that the threat of catastrophic flooding from Florence cannot be overstated.(The top image in the tweet below is forecast rainfall as a result of Florence, the bottom two images are rainfall from Harvey last year.)Florence is expected to cause historic river flooding and could cause problems for days in parts of North Carolina, according to estimates from local news station WECT.The Northeast Cape Fear river at Burgaw has a forecast crest of 24ft, which could surpass the previous record of 22.5ft. The Cape Fear river at Elizabethtown has a forecast crest of 29.6ft, and flooding is also expected at the Waccamaw river in Pireway, though the amount there is still unknown. The forecast crest is 19.2ft for the Lumber river in Lumberton.  reporter Oliver Laughland has some background on what’s at stake in Lumberton, where rains could cause a dump containing mercury, arsenic and lead to overflow into the water supply:Here are a few images from photographers on the ground: More than 80,000 customers are without power in North Carolina, according to the major electric utilities in the state. Duke Energy estimated that 1m to 3m of its 4m customers in the Carolinas could lose power due to Florence, the AP reports. There are now more than 12,000 people in 126 shelters in North Carolina, according to governor Roy Cooper. He said the demand is expected to increase and the state is in the process of opening more shelters. Cooper has also requested a presidential disaster declaration to expedite the process of receiving federal aid for recovery and cleanup: From the governor’s office: The added disaster declaration would go beyond the federal action already in effect, which is already providing Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and assistance as we prepare for the hurricane. The additional declaration would provide federal help with debris removal as well as FEMA search and rescue teams, disaster medical teams, hazardous material clean up assistance, meals, generators, fuel and more.The governor of Virginia has now advised residents to stay off the road and stay in place as Florence approaches landfall. From the AP: He says parts of Virginia will likely see tropical storm-force winds, flooding and several inches (centimeters) of rain.Although the forecast for Virginia is less severe than earlier in the week, Northam says “now is not the time to let down our guard.”He notes that forecasts for the weekend show a continued threat to southwest Virginia as the storm is expected to make a gradual northerly turn.There are now 400 people in shelters across the state, officials said.

It says this will end the long-term use of prefabs by 2021.Despite the scale of investment being announced, officials could not say yesterday whether all ageing schools in need of upgrades will get them within the next decade.Internal documents seen earlier this year by The  showed there were 575 school applications waiting for major refurbishments.A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said increased funding will provide a “pathway forward for dealing with all of these applications”.The capital budget for higher education, which was slashed as part of austerity-era cost-cutting, is also to treble, with €500 million to be targeted at a number of key projects.They include refurbished science and technology facilities at Dundalk IT, new engineering facilities for Limerick IT and upgrades to GMIT’s Castlebar campus.In addition, it will part-fund a major new “future tech” building in DCU and a new sports science facility at IT Tallaght.There will also be a new dedicated capital budget for the further education and training sector of €300 million to upgrade facilities over the coming decade,In a statement ahead of the formal launch today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the level of investment will ensure this generation of children and the next will “get the best possible start in life”.“I am particularly pleased that we’ll be investing in PE halls – modernising old ones and building new ones – to ensure all post-primary students can use state of the art PE facilities,” he said.“This will be especially important as we phase in PE as a Leaving Cert exam subject. Education doesn’t just drive economic success, it’s also crucial to giving everyone the opportunity to fulfil their full potential, in all parts of the country.”Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the investment is aimed at fulfilling the Government’s plan to make the “Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026.”However, Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman Thomas Byrne said the Government’s record on delivering so far was underwhelming.“We are inundated with queries from schools who have been waiting for years to know when their schools will be upgraded,” he said.“Progress is also very slow in delivering any of the 42 new schools announced last April. None of this gives me any confidence that this will be delivered.”"},{"url":null,"title":"housing activists stage sit down on luas tracks in dublin city centre","story":"  September 13, 2018Balaclava-wearing garda\u0026iacute helping remove protesters only inflames an already tense situation   September 13, 2018Notice says if the protesters fail to leave the property, the owner would seek an injunction   September 13, 2018Protesters clash with garda\u0026iacute as men in balaclavas eject group from city centre property "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3628497.1536860179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city council votes not to endorse candidate as %C3%A1ras race turns farcical","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential hopeful Norma Burke (Bunty Twuntingdon McFluff) at City Hall. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Dublin City Council has voted not to endorse any candidate for the 2018 presidential election as the race for the Áras took a farcical turn in the council offices at City Hall.Six presidential hopefuls were present in the council chamber on Thursday afternoon to plead their case for a nomination for the upcoming election.However, a theatrical presentation from Norma Burke, the latest candidate to seek a nomination for the presidency, led to outrage and disgust from councillors in attendance.Ms Burke, who also goes by the alias Bunty Twuntingdon-McFluff, introduced herself as a PR executive and laid out plans to turn Áras an Uachtaráin into a “hunting lodge and spa” where “wealthy guests would pay top dollar to hunt the deer in the Phoenix Park”.Ms Burke also proposed introducing a reality TV show called ‘In Your Áras’ which would follow the daily life of the president.Addressing the cathaoirleach, Lord Mayor Nial Ring, Councillor Mannix Flynn interrupted Ms Burke’s presentation, which he described as “outrageous” and “deeply offensive” .“This is an absolute insult to the office of the presidency and anyone nominating themselves for the office of the presidency,” Cllr Flynn said, prompting a murmur of agreement from other councillors present.Ultimately, Ms Burke was allowed to complete her presentation.Journalist Gemma O’Doherty opened her speech by paying tribute to “the brave young men and women who are currently occupying properties in the city” and told councillors she was “profoundly disturbed” at the sight of men in balaclavas at the Take Back the City protest on North Frederick Street in Dublin’s north inner city on Tuesday.If elected president, Ms O’Doherty said she would serve the cause of “truth, justice and integrity” for the Irish people and set the standard for “the sort of democracy we all want to live in”.“I believe that the boundaries of the presidency can be pushed out in order to stand up and defend those who have lost their voices in this country,” said Ms O’Doherty.Dubliner Sarah-Louise Mulligan told councillors she would fight to end the abuse of children and the elderly and as a “pro-life presidential candidate” she would donate a portion of her salary to setting up crisis pregnancy centres. “I’m pro life and I’m proud and I shouldn’t be ashamed to say that.”Businessman Peter Casey said as president, he would set up a programme to bring the foreign-born children of Irish emigrants to Ireland for a month’s holiday during which they would visit the Gaeltacht, Northern Ireland and Dublin. Mr Casey also called for the presidential term to be limited to five years and for greater transparency around the president’s expenses.Athlone woman Marie Goretti Moylan said she would use her influence as president to make the collection of artefacts in storage at the National History Museum more visible to the general public. Ms Goretti Moylan, who will begin a degree in law next week, called for the museum shop to be removed so that the remains of a dinosaur could be displayed in the Dublin museum.Roscommon farmer John Groarke said he felt like a “second-class citizen” while the president enjoyed “first-class citizen” status and called for a Republic where “everyone is equal”. In relation to the “housing thing”, Mr Groarke said the Government should take note of the “beautiful houses” built\u0026nbspby the Amish communities in the United States. “They don’t have much furniture but they have beautiful houses. We should talk to them and see how they do it.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3628684.1536874438!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord presidential hopefuls take a dander down daft avenue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Norma Burke aka Bunty Twuntingdon McFluff at City Hall. “I did this because I got so angry listening to people who want to be candidates but haven’t read the constitutional requirements for the job,” she said. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The If you think things are daft now, imagine how completely bonkers the presidential candidate selection process is going to be in seven years’ time.An unknown quantity (Seán Gallagher) almost got himself elected last time out by taking the council route to getting a place on the ballot paper.This didn’t go unnoticed by the wider world of notions and notice boxes. If this man can come from nowhere, what’s stopping us? There are no minimum entry requirements. The right person, at the right time, can talk themselves into contention.And there is no such thing as bad publicity.Hence this year’s mind-boggling collection of budding candidates doing the council circuit in the hope of bagging a place on the ticket. The fact that they are being entertained and getting media attention will only embolden the next batch.To say some of their nomination pitches are off the wall would be an understatement.Furniture tips from the Amish community in America?Tearing down Ireland’s corrupt political and media elite from within the walls of Áras an Uachtaráin?Why can’t we be nicer to Donald Trump?What about encouraging – at a hefty price – the progeny of Irish-America to go on trips of discovery to the aul’ sod “so they can absorb how amazing Ireland is”?And not forgetting “Bunty Twuntingdon-McFluff”, who both insulted and enraged members of Dublin City Council on Thursday with her less-than-subtle send-up of the entire ludicrous enterprise that this nomination process has now become.Councillors, by the way, having entertained pitches from six hopefuls, drew a swift veil across the proceedings by voting not to endorse the campaigns of any of the candidates.Bunty, as it turned out, was the only one to leave the chamber with what she wanted: to call out the absurdity of this business and puncture the presumptuousness of candidates who appear to have little awareness of the constitutional requirements of the office of president.It was clear even before the “nominations special meeting” began in City Hall that the majority of councillors had already decided to give their guests the bum’s rush after the formality of the speeches was over.But before the vote was taken to abandon ship, there was time for a short dander along Daft Alley with the aspiring presidents.Cllr Mannix Flynn, sitting next to the press box, supplied a steady stream of noises off as the speeches progressed.Lord Mayor Nial Ring called on the first speaker – Sarah-Louise Mulligan, an actor\u0026nbspand Marilyn Monroe impersonator from Dublin who hugely admires Donald Trump.“She’s out having her photo taken,” came a voice from the back of the hall.Mulligan, when she eventually arrived, was “going to speak about things I am passionate about”.Child abuse, domestic abuse, suicide, elder abuse, pro-life issues, the setting-up of crisis pregnancy centres, “entrepreneurism, homelessness . . .” She paused for effect before rounding off her list with a happy flourish, “and, of course, PRESIDENT TRUMP!”She launched into her address. As she was explaining her various passions, something knocked her off her stride. She stopped dead and looked up.“Sorry, I can hear a lot of whispering and it’s reeeeally putting me off. Can we control that for a little bit?”The councillors, unusually quiet it seemed to us, were gobsmacked. Mannix let out a very loud “shhhh”.Sarah-Louise shrugged. “It must be my imagination, so.”She ran out of time before she could talk about president Trump.On so to Peter Casey, the third of three businessmen who were big cheeses on RTÉ’s Dragons’ Den reality show and now fancy themselves as president. Of the other two, Seán Gallagher has his four nominations in the bag and Gavin Duffy will clinch his last one next week. Peter has none. On the strength of his diaspora-themed talk, he’ll have difficulty improving on that score.He described his humble beginnings in Derry, growing up in a large family in a house with an outside toilet.“My parents were both alcoholics,” he declared, as his audience pricked up their ears.“Same thing,” murmured Mannix. “You couldn’t make this up.”Marie Goretti Moylan has done a few pitches to councils at this stage. On Thursday, besides talking about how she will help victims of all kinds of abuse if she becomes president, she made a heartfelt plea for the return of Ireland’s dinosaur skeleton to its rightful home in the National History Museum. Apparently, it’s languishing in the basement in boxes and the museum shop has to be closed to accommodate it.“We have dinosaurs in America. We have dinosaurs in Europe,” quivered Marie Goretti.“We have dinosaurs here,” snorted Mannix, looking at his fellow councillors.“And we should be able to show off our Irish dinosaur,” insisted the potential president.John Groarke, a smiley, elderly gent with a grey beard and Michael D white hair, said he is a second-class citizen and he wants a more equal society.“As regards the housing thing,” he thinks we should consult the Amish people in America who build beautiful homes for themselves and have the most lovely furniture.Former INM journalist Gemma O’Doherty, who has earned a reputation for herself as something of a conspiracy theorist (her recent declaration that there was state involvement in the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin being a case in point) said she will serve the cause of “truth, justice and integrity” for the Irish people if elected president.She paid tribute to the young people occupying vacant properties in the city and was “profoundly disturbed” by the sight of men in balaclavas “guarded by our police force” removing the protesters from the properties.Of the six speakers, O’Doherty came across as the most reasoned over the short time allotted.And so to Bunty. Or Norma Burke, which is her real name and the one she had to supply to get a chance to make a pitch. She is a comedy film director, actor, journalist and community activist, and performed her speech “in character”, as she told us later.As PR queen Bunty, she will open up the Áras as an upmarket spa and hunting lodge. Guests will be able to shoot the deer, and, as an added bonus, they will be able to hunt the homeless who also live in the park.There were sharp intakes off breath as the “spoof candidate”, wearing a pink cardigan, pearls and a blonde wig, made a complete mockery of the process.Mannix was incensed. “Outrageous,” he roared. “It’s an absolute insult to the office of president!” Fianna Fáil councillor Deirdre Heney, looking appalled, tried to attract the mayor’s attention. “Deeply, deeply offensive,” bellowed Labour’s Dermot Lacey, as Bunty talked about culling “feral” inhabitants and using the bodies for fossil fuel.None of it mattered. Which was BuntyNorma’s point.The councillors voted not to endorse anyone.“I did this because I got so angry listening to people who want to be candidates but haven’t read the constitutional requirements for the job. I just took that to the nth degree. It’s absurd, what’s going on.”She says she broke no rules. She applied to speak, sent her request by email and was asked to present herself to be nominated.“I had five minutes to make my point. I took them.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3628433.1536859647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jacob rees mogg s band of brexiteers lose their nerve","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s former Brexit minister David Davis at a meeting of the pro-Brexit European Research Group in London. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesAs MPs left Westminster on Thursday for a three-week recess to attend their party conferences, Theresa May’s allies had an unexpected spring in their step. The prime minister’s Brexiteer critics in the European Research Group (ERG) were looking foolish after their leaders distanced themselves from a few dozen members who publicly plotted against May on Tuesday night.The ERG’s image as a highly disciplined machine had already taken a hit when it cancelled plans to publish its own blueprint for Brexit amid disagreements over its contents. Some members had apparently suggested including proposals for a missile defence shield and for a rapid response expeditionary force to protect the Falkland islands.The ERG went ahead on Wednesday with the publication of a paper on the Border, launching it in the splendid library of the Royal United Services Institute on Whitehall. The paper had been eagerly anticipated amid a swirl of rumours that the ERG was preparing to back a bold move to resolve the dispute between London and Brussels over the Border backstop.When the Commons Brexit committee, including ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg, visited Brussels last week Michel Barnier told them how he wanted to “de-dramatise” the backstop.“We need the necessary controls but we don’t want in any way to undermine the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom. We need to look at the inidual controls that are necessary,” he told the MPs.“We need to see how and when and where these controls would take place. They could be dispersed. They could take place in different places, on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland. They could be done using technological means.”Downing Street rejected the idea of carrying out checks at British ports on goods going to Northern Ireland, prompting Stewart Jackson, David Davis’s former chief of staff, to tweet:“So @10DowningStreet is now actively impeding the EU in trying to find a solution to the Northern Ireland border problem in order to unlock a #CanadaPlus FTA? Unbelievable.”Downing Street was taken by surprise by the ERG’s loss of nerve, revealing that if May had been asked about the paper during prime minister’s questions, she would have said that “we don’t believe that the answer is to move the Border” – something the ERG did not, in the end, suggest.A few hours later, a senior cabinet minister told me the government was united in its opposition to the EU’s version of the backstop, even in its de-dramatised form.“This is not just the DUP, it’s the Conservative Party, Remainers as well as Brexiteers. We can’t have Northern Ireland in a separate customs territory to the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said.British negotiators have yet to propose an alternative to the EU’s backstop text in the draft withdrawal agreement and they have been dragging their feet about providing Barnier with information about trade flows and current checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The Conservatives may be committed to what May likes to call “our special union” but the unresolved issue of the Border serves another purpose in the negotiations. It remains a strong argument against the Canada-style free trade agreement favoured by the Brexiteers and could serve as a lever to persuade the EU to bend their rules on the single market and customs union to Britain’s advantage.British ministers believe that if Dublin doesn’t blink when confronted with the cost of a no-deal Brexit to Ireland, the other EU member states may agree to move final resolution of the Border issue from the withdrawal agreement into the negotiation of the future relationship. If it is still unresolved after Britain leaves the EU next March, the Border could become more useful still to Britain as it negotiates the terms of its future trading relationship with Europe. The idea of “la perfide Albion” is deeply engrained in the European political consciousness, summed up brutally by Charles de Gaulle in his memoirs:“Pour l’Angleterre ... il n’y a pas d’alliance qui tienne, ni de traité qui vaille, ni le vérité qui compte.” (For England, there is no alliance that holds, no treaty which is respected, no truth which matters.)Few of today’s European leaders would speak so harshly of their British interlocutors but as the negotiations approach their endgame, they won’t be taking any chances either.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Young people will face many difficulties and disappointments.“So there comes a point where we have to say we should be helping young people cope with stress rather than trying to inoculate them from stressful situations.In 2015 the then universities minister, Jo Johnson, suggested raising standards because many people could gain a 2.1 degree while “coasting”.“If someone is a 2.2 candidate fine. They need to know that and they need to know how to live with that,” said Sir Anthony.“Much more needs to be done by universities to help students cope with the stresses of life. Rather than removing these obstacles for them we need to learn how to cope.”There were more than 2 million students studying at a university in England or Wales in the 12 months up to July 2017, meaning the suicide rate was 4.7 deaths per 100,000 students. Suicide rates were higher among young men than young women.The data shows that for both sexes, middle age is still the time of greatest risk of suicide.Please review our commenting policyMultiple injuries as dozens of gas blasts destroy homes in MassachusettsJeremy Clarkson\u0026#39s Who Wants to be a Millionaire? to return in 2019Heathers, Theatre Royal Haymarket, review: wicked, rebellious musical isn\u0026#39t just for fans of the filmSheet of rock crashes on holidaymakers on Greek island of ZakynthosHurricane Florence begins lashing US east coast as officials warn \u0026#39disaster is at the doorstep\u0026#39 - follow storm\u0026#39s path liveDwarf wrestlers slam charity that succeeded in banning \u0026#39freak show\u0026#39 tourDonald Trump claims \u0026#393,000 people did not die\u0026#39 in Puerto Rico hurricaneNo Offence, series 3 episode 1 review: a bizarrely similar plot to Bodyguard only the cops are Northern and swear more Press, episode 2 review: still not a patch on Doctor Foster – or even Press GangCornish pasties should be made with filo pastry, not shortcrust, health chiefs at Cornish hospital say Comment: Europe\u0026#39s populists don\u0026#39t want to leave the EU.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

Soros.”Of\u0026nbspthe Tory MEPs, Nosheena Mobarik rebelled to vote for the motion, while two others, Charles Tannock and Sajjad Karim, abstained.A government source said: This was simply a suggestion

Treasury document acknowledged there were questions about “rail access to the EU” if there is a no-deal Brexit.But No 10 refused to discuss what was meant by the reference on the “Operation Yellowhammer” document, photographed as a minister carried it into a Whitehall meeting.The government has previously acknowledged that planes would be grounded without a post-Brexit agreement, while

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

More than 300 firefighters, five aircraft and two helicopters were mobilised to tackle the extremely difficult situation due to strong gusts of wind, Athens fire chief Achille Tzouvaras saidIsraeli-annexed Golan Heights shows a smoke plume rising across the border in Quneitra in southwestern Syria, as rebels destroy their arms stocks prior to their departureThe committee pressed Beijing to disclose how many people have been detained and free them, but China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the demand as having “no factual basis” and said China’s security measures were comparable with those of other countries.The government’s business-as-usual defence, however, is contradicted by overwhelming evidence, including official directives, studies, news reports and construction plans that have surfaced online, as well as the eyewitness accounts of a growing number of former detainees who have fled to countries such as Turkey and Kazakhstan.The government’s own documents describe a vast network of camps – usually called “transformation through education” centres – that has expanded without public debate, specific legislative authority or any system of appeal for those detained.The New York Times interviewed four recent camp inmates from Xinjiang who described physical and verbal abuse by guards grinding routines of singing, lectures and self-criticism meetings and the gnawing anxiety of not knowing when they would be released. Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

This would go on promised tax cuts, pension reforms and a guaranteed minimum income that could cost Italy up to \u0026euro28 billion.Mr Moscovici said: \u0026ldquoYou can\u0026rsquot live with a public debt that is over 130 per cent (of GDP).

YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story.

The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.IT’S easy to dismiss Boris Johnson’s call for tax cuts as a ruse to distract from his personal difficulties. But he is right.The PM and her wet-blanket Chancellor have swallowed the group think about imposing new taxes to fund the NHS.Not only is it wrong, it plays into ­Corbyn’s hands. What’s the difference, voters will wonder, between Labour and the Tories if both will raise my tax?The overall burden is at a 30-year high. We should cut income tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty. It is a sure way to boost growth. Bizarrely, it can sometimes increase the sums raised.Donald Trump’s cuts to tax and regulation put rocket-boosters under US growth. We should do the same — and put more money in pockets . . .Not drain more life out of the economy.PARLIAMENT’S seats must be reformed to make elections fairer. The logic is ­unassailable. MPs must not reject it out of self-interest.It’s not a plot by the independent Boundary Commission against Brexiters. Nor is it against Labour, who ­routinely end up with more MPs than they deserve because they need fewer votes to win safe seats than the Tories.Each vote must carry the same weight.So boundaries must change and constituencies must be evened up, regardless of the upheaval — or the senior politicians inconvenienced.

They have built more houses, but not nearly enough for the extra demand the scheme created.The REAL solution is for the Government to free up land and relax planning rules to get hundreds of thousands more homes built for our booming population.That, and that alone, will help make them genuinely more affordable and get a generation on to the property ladder.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If affected, it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.To reduce the risk to others, stay off nursery, school or work, avoid preparing food and minimise direct contact with others until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.Mr Young said outbreaks could be difficult to control as it could be easily transmitted.He said: The most effective way to respond to an outbreak is to clean and disinfect contaminated areas very thoroughly and to institute good hygiene measures including hand-washing.The school have taken these measures and issued advice to children, parents and staff.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004226256211-e1536832284542.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"google maps couple beach kissing","story":"The love birds were snapped gazing into each others eyes, while sitting on towels in the blaring sunshine.The woman donning a pair of sunglasses and a grey t-shirt, tilts her head as she appears to be moving in for a smooch.Her partner appears equally as keen, but is somehow missing his right limbs and torso.Their positioning looks so twisted, it almost looks painful.As the user tried to zoom out of the bizarre image, a pair of legs without a body can be seen beside them.Google Street View snaps pics of different places using a mix of high-tech cameras strapped to an assortment of vehicles and user-uploaded photos.These images are then stitched together to make a 360-degree model of the world that users can click and drag to explore.But sometimes these panoramic views can go a bit haywire when pieced together.It comes after another Google Maps image showed a three-legged girl walking through an alleyway.The image of the girl walking with a friend in Split, Croatia, completely baffled Reddit users.Dozens of users branded her mutant girl as they tried to speculate what had caused the glitch."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433485425.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit no deal theresa may dominic raab","story":"If we end up quitting the EU without a deal, more than 2million British passports are likely to be useless on the continent.Ministers today published documents confirming that in a No Deal scenario, British people will need to have a passport which is valid for at least six months if they want to visit the EU.And they urged anyone who might be affected to act quickly - because there is likely to be a massive rush of Brits trying to renew their documents.The revelation came in a dossier of 28 contingency notices designed to show the Government is prepared for the potential collapse of talks with Brussels.The documents show:The documents warn that without a deal ensuring British citizens have access to the continent, UK travellers will be treated the same way as those from outside the EU.That means that they wont be able to enter the borderless Schengen zone unless their passport is valid for at least six months from the date of entry.Anyone whose passport expires within the next year is therefore at risk of being shut out from the EU from March next year and should apply for new documents, the Government warned.They said: If you are planning travel after 29 March 2019, and your passport will be affected by the new validity rules, we recommend you consider renewing your passport soon to avoid any delay, as the passport issuing service can get busy, especially in the spring.The warning is estimated to affect at least 2million Brits - because around 80 per cent of the population is believed to hold a passport, and of those roughly 5 per cent will be in their last six months.There could also be problems for British tourists hoping to drive to the continent or rent a car on holiday.Under No Deal, UK driving licences would no longer be valid in the EU so holidaymakers would need to buy an international driving permit, available at the Post Office for £5.50.The Government said: You may be turned away at the border or face other enforcement action, for example fines, if you don’t have the correct IDP.Ministers have already acted to head off the threat of phone firms hiking up roaming charges once we are no longer bound by the EU rules which outlaw them.They have agreed with O2, Vodafone, EE and Three that none of the largest companies will introduce new fees - though customers of smaller firms may still face a price rise.One unexpected effect of No Deal could be that Britain gets less warning of space debris falling to Earth thanks to the end of an information-sharing deal with Europe.Companies which export so-called non-harmonised goods - items such as furniture, bicycles and cooking tools which are governed by national rules rather than EU-wide regulations - may need new licences to continue selling them into Europe under a No Deal scenario.And shipping firms could be hit by additional red tape, the documents added.But ministers have also taken actions to minimise the disruption of a No Deal Brexit - such as saying we will continue to observe EU rules on the environment no matter what the outcome of Brexit talks.The right to travel freely between Britain and Ireland will continue even if there is no deal, under the rule of the Common Travel Area.And Irish citizens will “continue to enjoy the reciprocal rights” to live in the UK, as well as “work, study and vote, [and get] access to social welfare benefits and health services”.The Home Office says this will be the same for British citizens in Ireland.Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer rubbished todays announcements, saying: “The only reason the Government is talking about No Deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the Prime Minister from negotiating a good deal.And pro-EU MP David Lammy, a backer of the Best for Britain campaign, said: As these papers show, a No Deal Brexit will not only kneecap the British economy, disproportionately hurting the poorest. It will also make life more difficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit divide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a different type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion divorce bill if we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that if the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it difficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

to take place across several training grounds - will dwarf even this notorious exercise when it comes to scale.Military leaders released video footage of military vehicles, planes, helicopters and ships getting into position for the initial stage of the drills.The jaw-dropping numbers involved in the Vostok-2018 include:The Chinese claimed the vast operation was not directed against any third party and would focus purely on defences, firepower strikes and counterattack.”But close Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said the games would be at an unprecedented scale both in territory and number of troops involved”.He declared: Imagine 36,000 military vehicles moving at the same time: tanks, armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles  - and all of this, of course, in conditions as close to a combat situation as possible.”The manoeuvres are billed as testing the combat skills of the Russian land, air and naval forces.Putin’s spokesman said last month that maintaining Russias defence capabilities is justified, needed and has no alternative as rival powers are frequently quite aggressive and unfriendly”.The Russian army is rolling out its latest weaponry - Iskander missiles that can carry nuclear warheads, T-80 and T-90 tanks and its recent Su-34 and Su-35 fighter planes.At sea, the Russian fleet is deploying several frigates equipped with Kalibr missiles that have been used in Syria.For weeks Russia has been preparing for the drills - at one point closing a road so planes could land near Khabarovsk, and firing missiles from land, surface and submarine at a target in the Sea of Okhotsk.The war games are underway at five ranges in the east of Russia, and in the waters of the Sea of Japan, Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk.The deployment comes after an exercise last year in collaboration with Belarus in the west of the country which involved an announced 13,000 troops.Putin has spent hundreds of billions in recent years carrying out a major modernisation of the creaking forces he inherited from the Soviet era.Separately he has a large convoy in the Arctic and some 25 warships in the Mediterranean – the biggest deployment since the deployed forces in Syria three years ago.Ahead of the games, Russian forces unleashed a devastating display involving synchronised launches from land, surface vessel and submarine hitting targets in the Sea of Okhotsk.The live-fire exercise hit two drifting targets in the Sea of Okhotsk on Russia’s Pacific coast as Putin was on a trip to Siberia.Four different types of cruise missile were used in the attack - Vulkan, Granit, Malakhit and Onyx.They were fired from the missile cruiser Varyag - flagship of the Pacific fleet - as well as missile corvettes Razliv and Moroz, and the Tomsk nuclear powered submarine.They were supported by the Bastion missile system fired from land  and the distance of the targets was between 155 and 310 miles.“All seven cruise missiles successfully hit the targets,” said a statement from Russia’s eastern military district.Earlier vehicles were halted on the Khabarovsk to Komsomolsk-on-Amur motorway to allow Su-30SM, Su-35S and MiG-31 pilots to test their landing and takeoff skills on the narrow road, according to local reports.Military Mi-26 helicopters also swooped in to land on the highway, and an An-26 was seen touching down on the two-lane road.Halted motorists filmed the amazing scenes as they got a grandstand view for the military exercise close to the Chinese border in the Russian Far East.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But The Sun Online has been unable to verify this.And the dog in the latest snap shares different markings to those of Meghans beloved dogs - a beagle called Guy and a Labrador-shepherd mix called Bogart. She also reportedly adopted a black Labrador, Oz, with Prince Harry in recent months.The photo had sent Twitter into a frenzy after fans believed it showed Prince Harrys new wife in public without security.Sharing the snap on Twitter, Ms Petrillo claimed: So incredibly enough, walking by Kensington Royal - we spotted this beautiful, woman with a familiar air where Harry \u0026amp Meghan live.MEGHAN!? her dog was doing his business.Are you the woman in the photograph? Email us at tips@the-sun or call 0207 782 4368. You can WhatsApp us on 07810 791 502.She couldn’t have been sweeter. #princessespickuppooptooShe later added that the woman did pick up the dogs business, adding: Im still in total shock ! I pet her dog!The photograph shows the woman standing with her face down, staring at her phone. Her hair appears to be tucked into a ponytail underneath a black cap covering her face.Fans were quick to comment on the photo - debating on whether or not it was in fact the actual Duchess.One wrote: Sure looks like Meghan to me!Another added: What are the odds!!!!!!?? Have so much fun!!!But others werent so sure, with one writing: That’s not her... nor is it her dog.Another added: Totally not Meghan and doesnt remotely look like her dog Guy. Cute dog though.Meghan has always been a dog-lover and was heartbroken when she had to leave Bogart, her beloved Labrador-German Shepherd mix behind in Toronto when she moved to the UK.Her other dog, a beagle named Guy, was flown here in November but Bogart was thought too old to make the long plane journey.He is being looked after by friends of Meghan.Yet despite the cynicism, the entertainment reporter has since insisted that it was a true encounter.She wrote on Twitter: I’m here on vacation.NOT working. spotted her - as did many of us.

You were together, lived together, walked everywhere together. What does in fact connect you?”Boshirov replied: Lets not pry into our private lives.”Interviewer 38 year old Margarita Simonyan - who is head of the Kremlin “propaganda” channel later said: “I do not know if they are gays or not.“They are quite fashionable - with little beards, hair cuts, tight pants, sweaters tight over big biceps.“They did not harass me. Anyway Im already out of the harassable age.“Still, I poured them cognac for courage.“During the interview I told them that the world least of all worries with the question if they slept in one bed or not.The pair suggested they were ordinary tourists wanting to see - among other sights - Salisbury cathedral and Stonehenge.They spoke with the Kremlins propaganda-machine Russia Today on Wednesday in yet another attempt by Vladimir Putins regime to obscure the narrative surrounding the incident.Her comments have fuelled bizarre speculation in notoriously homophobic Russia over the pairs relationship.One online news portal even started a poll asking readers whether the pair were “agents made to be gays or gays made to be agents”.Elsewhere in the interview the pair said: Our friends had been telling us for some time we should visit this extraordinary town.Claiming to be interested in the history of the local area, they praised Salisbury Cathedral for its 123-metre spire and its clock, one of the first ever created in the world thats still working.Despite being filmed moments before the botched hit before leaving the country hours later in a flight out of Heathrow, the brazen Russians claimed they spent no more than an hour in Salisbury.Petrov said they wanted to visit Wiltshires pre-historic monument Stonehenge rather than carry out a state-sponsored execution on foreign soil.He said: Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn’t do it because there was muddy slush everywhere.The town was covered by this slush. We got wet, took the nearest train and came back .”Boshirov added: “We spent no more than an hour in Salisbury, mainly because of the lags between trains.“Maybe we did  Skripal’s house, but we don’t know where is it located.”It comes after Vladimir Putin said there is nothing criminal about Petrov and Boshirov.His comments set him up for yet another showdown with the West, after countries - including the US - backed Theresa Mays statement that the duo were assassins sent by the Russian state.In an escalating war of words, Russia claims the moves are to prepare the British public for aggressive measures against its country.During their chat with RT, Boshirov tried to paint himself and his colleague as victims, complaining about how being named as suspects has made them fear for their lives.If you’re laughing at Russia’s ridiculous lies over the Salisbury outrage, you’ve fallen into their trap.Admittedly it’s hard not to mock the absurdity of claiming two State assassins armed with Novichok were actually cathedral-loving tourists.But Dawn Sturgess died. Her partner almost did. The target Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia had to fight for life.Putin, proven guilty by forensics and intelligence and condemned by all but Jeremy Corbyn, resorts first to mickey-taking, now to fabrications so ludicrous they amount to the same thing.Russia wants to pass off the horror of this attempted assassination, the unleashing of a chemical weapon on a Wiltshire town, and its deadly aftermath, as a big joke with Britain as its target.Never forget: these killers were ordered to tell this preposterous story by a criminal regime of thieves, murderers and warmongers who shame a great nation.Speaking after Prime Ministers Questions last week, Theresa May said the suspects were members of the Russian Military Intelligence Service and were carrying out a mission on behalf of the state.She said: Based on a body of intelligence, the Government has concluded that the two individuals named by the police and CPS are officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU.But shamelessly the Russian Foreign Ministry has still called on Britain to justify the accusation that the pair are lying.Today Boshirov denied being a spy while claiming he had never even heard the name Skripal before.He said: I didnt know, I havent heard - until this situation, until this nightmare with us started, I havent heard this last name , I knew nothing about them.“We came here to you for protection. But it becomes some sort of interrogation -  we are starting to go deep. We are asking for your protection.Asked what they did for a living, Petrov said We are mid-scale entrepreneurs.He claimed they were involved in the fitness industry who deal in everything that comes to sport nutrition, vitamins, microelements, proteins and so on."},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair pilot emergency landing stansted airport","story":"Horrified passengers and crew watched as the nosewheel came off as the plane was headed to Copenhagen, Denmark.The pilot was forced to divert to East Midlands Airport - with cops holding traffic on the M1 motorway in case disaster struck.Video shows the plane, which was carrying around 154 passengers, skid down the tarmac with smoke in its wake.A report by the Air Accident Investigations Branch told how crew on another departing flight saw the wheel bounce away down the runway during the incident on September 15 last year.The report said: As the aircraft entered the runway  air traffic control cleared the crew to take off.“The flight crew heard a noise similar to the nose wheels passing over a runway centre light.“An aircraft waiting at the hold informed air traffic control they had seen one of the nose wheels depart the aircraft and be blown off the runway.“They could also see what appeared to be part of the aircraft on the runway.”According to the report, the wheel came off because the nose landing gear axle had failed.It added: This was the result of heat-induced cracking and material property changes due to abusive grinding of the chrome plate during the part’s last overhaul almost three years earlier.“The Maintenance and Repair Organisation that performed the overhaul has introduced a new inspection for detecting abusive grinding.”Air traffic control at Stansted alerted the captain and crew onboard and they “assessed the situation” which saw them find guidance on “landing with a flat tyre” in their manual."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433588637.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"christmas fans september","story":"She sees no better time to pull on her Christmas jumper, ramp up the novelty hits and start decorating the tree than the 13th September - why?

Our family adore Christmas and we never get bored of it, she tells Sun Online.Its an incredibly special time for us, and the kids finally come in from playing outdoors to cosy up on the sofa.We are always the first on our street but everybody loves it!While the weekend ahead might be forecast for us to enjoy the last remnants of our British summer, Sarah and her three children - Joseph, 13, Alfie, 11, and Leonna, nine - will be cuddled up around their tree.With fairy lights, a snow projector, and a six foot Father Christmas, the family transform their house in Billingham, County Durham, into a Winter Wonderland at the same time every year.They even have a huge inflatable snow globe outside of the bedroom window, and fake snow covering the floor.Self-confessed festive fanatic Sarah, 34, with the help of her husband Shaun, 37, says it takes around four to five days to perfect their tinsel-tastic home - which could outdo Santa’s own grotto.Under the tree, they also have a train track filled with sweets, and they invite the children from their street to come and pick up a sweet from their Christmas train.But the most prized decoration is all, is the star that goes on top of the tree. It represents their daughter Libby, Leonnas twin sister, who died shortly after birth.The kids always fight over who is going to put the star up. We think of Libby all of the time, but its at this time of the year shes with us the most, Sarah says.Each child has a decoration that represents them. Alfie has a hedgehog and Leonna has a flower.Over in Birmingham, John Copestick has also been celebrating Christmas in September for the last 35 years.Last year, every surface of his three-bed semi he shares with wife Jean was covered in lights – the front of the house displayed four wreaths, a Father Christmas and a reindeer, and a nativity scene with a light-up Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.And as you enter through to John and Jean’s magical kingdom , the ceiling is barely visible beneath reams of silver tinsel and giant red baubles.Around the back, you’ll also find the family garden lit up with luminous reindeer, jingle bells, and even a sleighing Santa.The couple have been decorating their house this way for 35 years, and their little corner of Birmingham has become a pillar for the community at Christmas time.John and Jean always plan to have every last detail Santa-ready by October half-term, so children from the local Allen’s Croft Primary School can come to visit.We love doing it, he says.For those of us not content with the most wonderful day of the year, there are several social media groups celebrating Christmas all year round.Glossy magazines start compiling their gift lists when it’s still baking hot outside, and now there’s even a Christmas TV channel - Christmas 24 - dedicated to showing Christmas movies all year round.They even host a special ‘Christmas in July’ event with festive movie marathons showing all day, every day throughout the British summer.One follower of the channel’s Facebook page is Marie Parkinson, who tell us her friends call her ‘little miss Christmas’.She says: “I love Christmas so much, and the page inspired me to host Christmas with a twist in July.“I put a huge tree up in the garden and we had an extra Christmas day. We had BBQ sprouts, pigs in blankets and stuffing balls!“Each Christmas I have my own theme. This year, it’s penguins. I believe Christmas is for life, not just for Christmas.”Elsewhere, there’s an Instagram page @christmasallyear_round, which has a cult following of over 54,000.The page is sprinkled with images of Christmas magic on every square – including postcard pretty snaps of hot chocolate, presents under the tree and snowy landscapes.And the first public Christmas trees were spotted in Edinburgh - and even Watford - this weekend.We suppose we better start thinking about our shopping, then... Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has mastered a hugely complex brief without putting a foot wrong yet.He was right to slap down John Lewis for blaming Brexit for their profit woes when they are simply under siege from cut-price competitors, especially online.Right, too, to insist the EU won’t see our £39billion without signing a deal.Why did we not show such steel two years ago when it was clear how aggressive Brussels would be? It’s a little late.The EU is surely keeping Chequers alive only to spring a trap on Theresa May: a last-minute demand for some fatal compromise.In that event she must change tack. Brussels is reportedly up for a Canada-style free trade deal.The PM should be ready to change course for that instead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nixon, best known for her Emmy-winning role on HBO\u0027s Sex and the City, had been trailing Cuomo by 30 points or more in opinion polls. The race had turned increasingly bitter and expensive, as Cuomo spent 18 million to Nixon\u0027s 1.6 million, according to state figures.    Nixon, who has never held office, has said Cuomo\u0027s experience has not translated to good governance, Cuomo has said she is inexperienced and naive. In a contentious debate last month, Cuomo told Nixon to stop interrupting him, to which she responded: Can you stop lying? Cuomo, 60, was born into politics as the son of Mario Cuomo, a longtime public figure who also served as New York governor.  The younger Cuomo, a former Clinton administration official, controls the party\u0027s state machinery and secured endorsements from members of the party establishment. Before casting his ballot at a church in the town of Mount Kisco, Cuomo said New Yorkers must stand up to changes being made in Washington that he said ran counter to the state\u0027s values, according to local channel News 12 Westchester. There is a divisiveness that is coming out of Washington that I think is cancerous to our nation, Cuomo said.  Nixon, 52, has touted herself as a democratic socialist and a champion of causes such as abortion access, better funding for schools and equal rights for gay and lesbian people. She greeted voters in Manhattan\u0027s Union Square on Thursday and cast her ballot at an East Village community centre.  My family didn\u0027t have a lot of money, but I had opportunities that I don\u0027t see for the vast majority of kids today. We can change that, she appealed to voters on Twitter.

But these No Deal Brexit warnings suggest it\u0027ll turn into a head-scratching mess of hassle, faff and red tape. Tory ministers have published 28 new papers showing how they\u0027re preparing for the unlikely event there\u0027s no agreement with Brussels. And crucially, today\u0027s documents spell out how you the British public should prepare too. You could have to renew your passport, buy a driving permit and buy special mobile phone packages if the UK crashes out on 29 March 2019.  Today\u0027s is the second batch of no deal papers after 25 were published last month, and there\u0027s at least one further batch to come.   Already critics claim they make a mockery of promises that Brexit would sweep away red tape. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: “Our smallest firms simply do not have the capacity or resources to deal with added costs and administrative burden that an unplanned no-deal Brexit will bring. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer added: The only reason the government is talking about no deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal. Today\u0027s papers were agreed after a marathon three-hour special Cabinet meeting on no deal, that heard from Bank of England governor Mark Carney.   EU chiefs have said a deal is possible by mid-November, but Theresa May is still trying to rally MPs round the main element of her plan for customs drawn up at Chequers. Up to 50 right-wing Brexiteer Tories met in Parliament this week and some openly discussed ousting the Prime Minister. That prompted a counter-meeting of a similar number of pro-May MPs in Parliament last night. A new clash is also in the pipeline just days before the Tory conference, with The Times reporting Mrs May will convene a special Cabinet meeting to discuss a hardline post-Brexit immigration strategy to please the Tory grassroots. Meanwhile the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, has claimed Britain will REFUSE to pay its \u0026pound39bn Brexit divorce bill in full if there is no deal with the EU. So what do the papers say? Have a read and judge for yourself. 1. You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter \u0027Schengen area\u0027 countries with a valid passport even if they only have a day left before they expire. But in the event of a no deal Brexit, after 29 March 2019 you may not be able to travel to these countries if you have less than six months left on your passport. The government is now advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months\u0027 remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, the technical note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  If there’s no deal, we’ll lose access to the EU’s Space Surveillance and Tracking service - the system that stops satellites crashing into each other. The system also provides member states with early warnings about satellites and debris from space vehicles falling back to Earth. We will, however, continue to receive space surveillance and tracking data from the United States. We\u0027ll just have to trust Donald Trump. This note doesn\u0027t include asteroids, which are monitored by a separate system. But regardless, Labour MP Jo Stevens of the Best For Britain group said: Theresa May used to say Brexit wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world - but actually it could be! 3. You could have to buy a \u0026pound5.50 licence for a French day trip  Motorists may need special permits to drive in the EU. UK licences are all visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, they may need an International Driving Permit. The \u0026pound5.50 documents would be sold at 2,500 post offices from February. Currently they\u0027re sold at fewer than 100, and earlier this year the National Audit Office warned the government was not ready. The number of permits issued would have to soar from 100,000 a year to 7million.  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June 2017, meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreement if the UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing 85% of customers - Three, EE, O2 and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government warns.  Families who are midway through divorce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on 29 March 2019. Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advice if they will not finish by Brexit Day. The technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” Under a similar principle, companies applying to make EU firms insolvent or those seeking to chase small debts could also have to seek legal advice. 6. UK cars won\u0027t be automatically \u0027valid for sale\u0027 in the EU  British carmakers and firms supplying car parts from the UK would face more red tape to sell their vehicles and components on the continent. The paper says: “In a no deal scenario,  type-approval issued in the UK would no longer be valid for sales or registrations on the EU market. EC type-approvals issued outside of the UK, would no longer be automatically accepted on the UK market. This means that affected manufacturers would need to ensure that they have the correct type-approval for each market.” The Best for Britain anti-Brexit group claims this could be another blow to the motor industry - which employs thousands of hard-working Brits. 7. Medicines and perfumes \u0027could become more expensive\u0027  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. So if we leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between \u0026pound109 and \u0026pound3,665. They will also need an import/export license, which costs \u0026pound24. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certify a product for the whole EU market. But if there’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks won\u0027t be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. 8. Shopkeepers could be slapped with a bicycle ban  UK shops will face fresh red tape or could even be banned from importing a string of items such as bicycles, cooking utensils or furniture. The change affects ‘non-harmonised’ manufactured goods. This means goods which have strict standards in UK law, which aren’t matched across the EU as a whole. Currently, a product made to fit one EU country’s standards can then be marketed legally in any other EU country. This is called “mutual recognition”. So a bicycle made to French standards can be marketed in the UK, even if it would not normally meet UK standards. But in a no deal Brexit, all these imports to the UK will have to meet UK standards. It will be up to individual businesses to ensure their products meet those standards. The notice does not cover food, for which officials say “further information will be provided in due course”. 9. UK taxpayers could have to match billions in funding that used to come from the EU "},{"url":null,"title":"brit holidaymakers zante describe scenes","story":"NewsBrit holidaymakers in Zante describe scenes \"like Dunkirk\" after tons of rock fall from cliff onto packed beachAt least seven people were injured on the Greek island as emergency services checked that no-one was trapped under fallen rocksShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills17:03, 13 SEP 2018Updated18:16, 13 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/world-news/video/scenes-like-dunkirk-after-tons-13239856,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritish holidaymakers ran for their lives as huge rocks fell from a cliff face at a popular beach on the Greek island of Zante. At least seven people were injured and as emergency services were called in to check that no-one was trapped under fallen rocks. Shocking video captured the side of the cliff suddenly give way, towards the tourists sunbathing below. It showed bathers running in panic as a large part of a cliff peeled off the rockwall and tumbled down at a point close to the sandy shore.  A couple of small boats overturned from the force of the fall that caused high waves, witnesses told authorities. Lynette Bridges, from Essex, said her tour boat had just pulled up to the popular Shipwreck Beach when an enormous sheet of stone crashed into the sea, capsizing boats and flooding the crowded beach.

Mrs Bridges said: It was like Dunkirk, all these people coming to the edge of the water, all these boats of people coming to get them and all this panic. There were no people missing but authorities had air and sea teams in the area conducting a search as a precaution, in case people were trapped under the rocks, one official said. So far, we haven\u0027t found any trapped people but we will continue searching, a fire brigade official said.

Hockney, 81, painted \u0027Portrait of an Artist \u0027 in 1972. It features a man in trunks swimming breast stroke towards the end of the pool with Hockey\u0027s former boyfriend, artist Peter Schlesinger, fully-clothed, looking down at him. He painted the piece in London from photographs taken at Le Nid du Duc in the South of France. The large painting, which measures 213.5cm x 305cm, is thought to be owned by Joe Lewis, the rags-to-riches British billionaire who owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. Following weeks of rumours, auction house Christie\u0027s today confirmed it will be selling the painting in November - and it has an estimate of 80 million .  If it achieves this price it will make Yorkshire-born Hockney the most expensive living artist, smashing the 58.4 million paid for Jeff Koons\u0027 Orange Balloon Dog sculpture at Christie\u0027s in 2013. Alex Rotter, co-chairman Post-War and Contemporary Art, Christie\u0027s, said: Christie\u0027s is honoured to offer Portrait of an Artist , which stands as one of the great masterpieces of the modern era. David Hockney\u0027s brilliance as an artist is on full display with this monumental canvas, which encapsulates the essence of the idealized poolside landscape, and the tremendous complexity that exists within human relationships. With this painting, Hockney cemented his placement within the realm of history\u0027s most venerated artists, and come November, it is poised to become the most valuable work of art by a living artist ever sold at auction. The painting will be sold by Christie\u0027s at its Evening Sale of Post-War and Contemporary Art on November 15 in New York.

Sophie Hinchcliffe - known as Mrs Hinch - had no idea her tips would prove so popular and gain her hundreds of thousands of followers around the world. She has now sparked a frenzy of people stockpiling cleaning products to make their homes spotless - with some items selling out and going on eBay for triple the price. If you step inside Sophie\u0027s Essex house you will find immaculately clean floors, skirtings and worktops decorated in cool grey tones, reports Essex Live .  The 28-year-old hairdresser created her profile @MrsHinchHome_X_ in March when her now husband Jamie began to decorate the Maldon home they bought two years ago. However, it has only been since July that the number of followers sky rocketed when she started sharing her cleaning routines, and now she has more than 265,000 followers. It just spiralled and I couldn\u0027t be more grateful, she said. It started off as around 200 or 500 [followers] a month and now it\u0027s as many as 35,000 a day. It\u0027s in the last four to six weeks that it has gone viral. I\u0027ve got followers from Ireland, the US and Australia and they are all amazing.  Her dedicated following have started calling themselves \u0027Hinch Army\u0027, using #HinchArmy to share their own successes using some of Sophie\u0027s methods and recommended products. She believes that the success of the page is down to her being true to herself and sharing her love for having fun when cleaning. Sophie said: It\u0027s been overwhelming but amazing. People are sharing before and after photos of their homes and I\u0027m just so pleased my account has helped so many people together. I don\u0027t bombard cleaning on my grid page. It\u0027s mainly on my stories and my page then shows the results of fun cleaning, aka Hinching.  I name all my cloths and cleaning equipment, which may sound odd to some, but it is a laugh for us all and now everyone is getting involved. It\u0027s unbelievable. I\u0027m a worrier and I struggle with anxiety, she added. For me, to keep my mind off of what was worrying me would be to clean and organise something and love the end result. It took my mind off worrying. It helps me control my panic attacks too. Since I\u0027ve started the account others have messaged me saying I\u0027ve changed their lives and helped them with their mental health which to me is simply amazing. I get thousands of messages each day like this.  Sophie has even got her husband involved in her antics. Jamie is so supportive, she said. He is amazing. He gets involved too and I ask him to try and \u0027Hinch\u0027 the sinks. Everyone loves Mr Hinch and watching him too. Sophie shares the products she uses and what is in her cleaning \u0027baskets\u0027 and wants people to know that she does not clean all the time. Everyone seems to have caught the \u0027Hinch\u0027 bug, she said. They are wanting to try the products I love and it\u0027s great to see the army itself helping each other, complimenting each other and sharing tips.  But I don\u0027t clean constantly every day. As long as I clean for around 30 minutes or an hour each day I feel OK. I like to clean as and when something needs to be done. I clean for fun. My thing is the kitchen sink. The Hinch Army loves a shiny sink. She also maintains that you do not need to spend a fortune for sparkling results. I have many cleaning baskets, Sophie said. Consisting of a weekly basket and a daily one. I would say that organising my cleaning products is the biggest thing that I enjoy.  We all like to have our products in the right basket. I\u0027m also pine mad so I have to have pine products.  I shop in Poundstretcher and Poundland and B\u0026ampM for my items. I use things because they are cheap but they work well. I don\u0027t always go for the really expensive products. Now I\u0027ve shown my followers what I like to buy, I go into the shops and struggle to find my favourites as the shelves have been Hinch hauled. But it\u0027s so funny to see. Sophie is not planning on slowing down any time soon. Her account is now the second most influential home interior account on Instagram in the UK and she is excited to see where this could lead to.

Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are accused of using Novichok in an effort to kill former Russian spy Sergei and his daughter Yulia when they visited on March 4. Hours after their 30-minute whistlestop tour, they were on a plane back to Moscow, but denied the purpose of their trip was to assassinate Skripal. Today, in an interview on the Russian state-funded RT news channel, they denied working for the Russian intelligence service and claimed to be victims of a fantastical coincidence. They said they left the Wiltshire city because of heavy snow after half an hour.  But they have not explained why they were pictured walking together in Wilton Road, round the corner from Sergei Skripal\u0027s house, in the opposite direction to the cathedral. After their images were released by the British government, neighbours also claimed to have seen Petrov and Boshirov loitering in a children\u0027s playground yards from Skripal\u0027s home in Christie Miller Road. The playground, which is at the end of an alleyway that leads onto Wilton Road, was cordoned off on the day the father and daughter were poisoned. An elderly local resident who tipped off police about the sighting told the Mirror earlier this month: There were some men on that playground I remember that, I remember thinking it was odd. They were too old to be in there, looked tough.  I thought it was odd at the time but what am I going to do- call police about grown men sitting on a swing. Then Sergei gets poisoned and I began to think oh god was that them? I’ve told the police this before. I think it’s why it got cordoned off. I think they sorted themselves out there, watched for Sergei’s car to go, and got in and out. The men broke their silence to Russian state-funded news channel RT a week after Britain accused the pair - named as - of carrying out the failed hit. They said they are the men pictured in CCTV images, but claim they travelled to the UK for just 48 hours as tourists after friends had suggested for a long time that they visit the wonderful town in Wiltshire.  In Britain, the interview was quickly labelled a farce, with the Government saying it was full of lies. British investigators have accused the men of working for the GRU and operating under aliases in the UK. The men said they are afraid to go outside at home, with Boshirov adding: We fear for our lives. And for the lives of our families and friends. In an interview broadcast on Thursday, the men spoke to Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of RT , who claimed the pair didn\u0027t show their passports, just their national identity cards, to prove their identities. Speaking in Russian, the men, claiming to work in sports nutrition, said they arrived in the UK on March 2, checked a timetable at a railway station that day and then travelled to Salisbury by train on March 3. The pair, from a country with some of the coldest temperatures and heaviest snow on earth, claim their visit was short-lived because the town was covered in snow  and there was muddy slush everywhere. The temperature in Salisbury was about 5C that afternoon and there was a layer of snow at the cathedral and through the rest of the town due to a snowstorm that hit the previous day.  Stonehenge was shut that Saturday and some roads were treacherous. Wiltshire Police had said on Twitter that the A303, which leads to Stonehenge, was open but warned people to travel only if necessary because many roads were still proving difficult as the snow melted. Petrov said of the weather: We tried to walk through the town, but we lasted for only half an hour because it was covered in snow. Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn’t do it because there was muddy slush everywhere. The town was covered by this slush. We got wet, took the nearest train and came back .” Boshirov added: “We spent no more than an hour in Salisbury, mainly because of the lags between trains. Maybe we did  Skripal’s house, but we don’t know where is it located.”  The pair returned to Salisbury on March 4 - the day of the poisoning - because, according to Petrov, everything had melted away in London, there was warm and sunny weather.  He added: We specifically went there [again] to see the Old Sarum and the cathedral and decided to finish this thing on March 4. Simonyan asked: “What thing?” Petrov replied: “To see the cathedral. Just a few hours later, they were on a flight back to Moscow. In Salisbury, the pair were seen on CCTV walking on snow-free pavements near Sergei\u0027s home in Christie Miller Road, about a mile from the city\u0027s railway station in the opposite direction of the cathedral, on March 4. The men said they were not carrying Novichok or any other poison, and they did not have a perfume bottle in their luggage. It is claimed that the toxin was brought into the UK in a counterfeit perfume bottle.

The polling of youngsters suggests 800,000 children aged 11-16 years in England are having to care for someone at home. Nearly a third  were responsible for “high level caring” indicating nearly 260,000 secondary school pupils are required to do domestic work, household management and emotional care for a relative. It is a significant increase from previous estimates, from the 2011 census, only identified 166,000 young carers in England between the age of 5-17 years. It suggests huge numbers are children have been forced to pick up the pieces due to restrictions to disability benefits and the crumbling social care system.  Research was carried out by Nottingham University and BBC News questioning 925 children in Years 7 and 10. The secondary school pupils who responded lived with a family member who had an illness or disability and included elderly relatives. Giles Meyer, chief executive of the Carers Trust, said: “This new data blows all previous figures out of the water, revealing a generation of young carers who are being neglected by society. “This is a monumental wake-up call for us all to take responsibility for these vulnerable children. “Staggeringly there are six young carers in every secondary school classroom which gives us an incredibly worrying sense of the scale of this issue for the first time in a decade. “Whilst these new figures are shocking, we are not at all surprised. A lack of government commitment to making sure these vulnerable children are routinely identified in school and supported means young carers are slipping through the net.

Paranoid schizophrenic Hassan Mustafa, 35, killed Khalid Yousef, 28, at the bookmakers in Rookery Road, Handsworth, at lunchtime on January 4 this year. Birmingham Live reports that Mustafa, from Sparkbrook, who sought political asylum in the UK in 2013, was charged with murder originally as an indictment. But a jury at Birmingham Crown Court recorded a special verdict of not guilty to murder by reason of insanity.  As both the prosecution and defence accepted Mustafa was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the offence a murder verdict could not be returned. The other verdict open to the jury was manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. Judge Melbourne Inman said: “This is a very sad and tragic case. He has been acquitted of murder because of the terrible mental illness he suffered. The affect of the verdict of is that I make a hospital order and a restriction order. “The affect of that is Mr Mustafa will return to Reaside Clinic but a decision if he will ever be released will he made by the Secretary of State. I can’t understand the grief Mr Yousef’s family have suffered but they have shown such great dignity.” The court heard how Mustafa had entered the bookies armed with up to four knives and asked Mr Yousef to go outside where they began fighting.  CCTV played in court captured the moment Mr Yousef went back into the shop followed by Mustafa who was brandishing a large bread knife where he then attacked him inside the premises. Staff and customers tried to intervene but as the knife attack became more frenzied the manager triggered a ‘fog cannon’ device which caused the shop to fill with smoke. Staff and customers fled the building. Armed police arrived at the scene and when the smoke cleared they saw Mr Yousef’s mitigated body slumped up against the customer door with Mustafa standing over him. No-one else had been injured in the incident. Outside the shop he admitted to police he had killed Mr Yousef claiming “he did it for the lord.” "},{"url":null,"title":"princess eugenies wedding dress code","story":"NewsPrincess Eugenie\u0027s wedding dress code will be a lot stricter than Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027sPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank\u0027s wedding is actually going to be BIGGER than Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s - but there are some key differencesShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor17:12, 13 SEP 2018NewsThe big day is nearly here \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Just a few months after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s unforgettable wedding day, the royal family will be back in the same church to watch Princess Eugenie tie the knot .   The Queen\u0027s granddaughter will marry her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle next month.   Naturally people have been comparing the two events, and surprisingly it looks like Eugenie\u0027s special day will be even bigger than her more senior cousin\u0027s.  As well as the size of the event, both in terms of guestlist and length, there\u0027s another big difference between the weddings - the dress code.  Unlike Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding, pictures of the invitations weren\u0027t officially released, but a copy has been leaked.  As well as all the event details it offers a suggested dress code, reports Town and Country .  At Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding, guests were given the choice of wearing a uniform, a morning coat or a lounge suit. But chaps lucky enough to have been invited to Eugenie and Jack\u0027s big day will have to wear a morning coat.  Unlike Prince Harry, Jack isn\u0027t a military man so he won\u0027t be wearing a uniform on his wedding day. However the dress code is the same for women, and both couples requested their guests wear a day dress and hat. Eugenie and Jack\u0027s wedding will take place on October 12, and is believed to be a two-day celebration. The formal service and a lunch time reception organised by the Queen will be held on the Friday, followed by an evening party.

Brenda Osborne, born in Mansfield, Nottingham, in 1913, shared her tips with carers at her retirement home during her 105 birthday party. She told them that she got to her old age by steering clear of men, working hard and getting out in the fresh air. Brenda, who was born the same year as the first ever Chelsea Flower Show even received an award for having one day off sick in 33 years as a nurse. The centenarian lived in her childhood home for a staggering 93 years before moving into the nursing home last year - just after her 104 birthday. She shared the modest two bedroom property with her two sisters, Vera and Beryl and nephew Ian before they passed away. Speaking of her longevity, determined Brenda said: I would put my good health down to hard work and avoiding men.  I loved celebrating my birthday although I was disappointed the Queen didn\u0027t come. I received my letter from her but I thought an appearance was the least she could do. Brenda was educated at Carter Lane School and Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School and in her younger years loved to go to her caravan at Ingoldmells. She first started work at Victoria Hospital in 1940, nursing Dunkirk veterans. She became an assistant nurse in 1946 and then a senior nurse 1953. Brenda now resides at Brookholme Croft Nursing Home in Hasland and marked the milestone birthday with a party. Speaking of Brenda’s big day, her great-niece Marie Pollard said: “It was a lovely day for Brenda to celebrate with all her nearest and dearest.

Just scrolling through the reviews on TripAdvisor tells you that people love its spire, as well as the grounds and architecture.  But it seems there may be a bit of a problem with fake reviews on the page.  In particular the review left by Ruslan Boshirov is raising eyebrows - because many people don\u0027t believe Boshirov has actually been to the Cathedral, despite his claims to the contrary.  if the name sounds familiar to you it\u0027s because....   Britain has accused two Russians, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov , of carrying out the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.   The suspects have denied being spies in Vladimir Putin\u0027s military intelligence service and insist they were merely visiting Salisbury cathedral on the day of the Novichok attack.   Today, in an interview on the Russian state-funded RT news channel , they claimed to be victims of a fantastical coincidence.   Mere hours after their interview, a TripAdvisor account was created using Boshirov\u0027s name.   It features an image taken from the Russian\u0027s appearance on TV as the profile picture.  The prank account has only left one review so far - on the page for Salisbury Cathedral and Magna Carta .  The review is headlined eventful trip. It reads: I wanted to visit the WorldWide famous town of Salisbury since I was a boy. Could say it was eventful.  The reviewer also gave the cathedral a five star rating. So far 32 people have voted the review as helpful. As well as the one claiming to be by Boshirov, another joke review was left on the page by someone with the username Novichek.  It says: My two daddies took me to this wonderful cathedral that all their friends have been talking about! But they left me there. If anyone knows where my Daddy’s are please help! A TripAdvisor reviewer named Mark R also decided to join in on the controversial joke, writing: Me and my co-assassin, sorry, \u0027tourist\u0027 went there because the big man  needed a loose end sorting out, sorry - photo\u0027s of the spire for his photo-collection of massive erections.

The storm, which is currently swirling off the coast of the United States, appears to be on a collision course for the UK. The National Hurricane Centre  has predicted its journey from the Atlantic Ocean, with Ireland and the west coast of England set to be hit first. By 7am on Sunday morning, the violent cyclone will have made a dramatic U-turn - steering northeast towards Europe. It will take two days to reach UK shorelines with high winds predicted for 7am on Tuesday, the NHC predicts.    Helene was located about 1,285 miles south-southwest of the Azores in the Atlantic with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour on Wednesday. Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said: There is a chance Helene will be caught up in the jet stream and that would bring some wet and windy weather to the UK after the weekend. However this will depend on the conditions around the UK at the time of arrival, it could end up strengthening high pressure emphasising drier conditions.  But the hurricane\u0027s approach to Britain might not be bad news, as remnants of the storm could heat up the already warm conditions expected next week. Ms Smith added: There is a chance the southeast could turn very warm next week and this could be another effect of the remnants of Helene. Already we expect temperatures in the region to be higher than average for the time of year due to the direction of airflow bringing warmer air in from the Atlantic. Air associated with Helene could end up being caught up with this bringing even warmer conditions.  Meanwhile, the national forecaster yesterday revealed its list of storm names for 2018 to 2019 . The next severe weather will be named Storm Ali to reflect our diversity. This is the fourth year the government weather services of Britain and Ireland have combined to name disruptive systems. But this is the first time \u0026shyofficials have added names to improve race relations. A Met Office spokesman said: This season’s names have been compiled from a list submitted by the public... selecting names that reflect the nations, culture and diversity. The list of 21 includes Storm Idris which may be a nod to actor Idris Elba.

Sarah Bramley, 29, pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court on Thursday to encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. The defendant, of Darlington, Co Durham, sent former partner David Saunders, 33, a picture of her performing a sex act on her new lover, 34-year-old Michael Lawson. It is understood that Bramley sent the image believing her ex-partner would carry out a common assault, rather than a murder. But in the early hours of July 1 last year, shortly after receiving the photo, Saunders stabbed father-of-one Mr Lawson through the heart.  In December, Saunders was jailed for life at Teesside Crown Court with a minimum term of 22 and a half years, after he admitted murdering Mr Lawson. At the time, Judge Stephen Ashurst told the murderer: Jealousy was very much at the heart of your behaviour. Ultimately a life was needlessly lost because of a loss of control. Bramley was granted bail and will be sentenced at the same court in October.  A court heard Saunders was tipped over the edge by the explicit image. As he issued threats against Sarah and Michael Lawson, she goaded him by texting: He is twice your size, maybe Davey Saunders might actually get a bat, his trial heard last year. From the witness box Saunders told of his anger at being sent the explicit photograph.  He forwarded it to his friend Claire Richards and said: I was upset, really upset and angry. I loved her, it was not nice to see that. I felt angry. Judge Stephen Ashurst ruled that Miss Bramley\u0027s action had a very important bearing on Saunders\u0027 actions. But she was not at the trial last year, having travelled to Australia soon after the killing, with the full knowledge of the police. She was held after re-entering the UK earlier this year and yesterday appeared at Teesside Crown Court charged with inciting an assault. She pleaded guilty on the basis that she did not intend Saunders to commit murder and that she only anticipated there may be a minor assault.  Robert Newcombe, for Bramley, said: My client has indicated that she pleads guilty on the basis of incitement to cause common assault. Judge Ashurst asked prosecutor Nick Dry: This is notwithstanding the fact she knew Saunders had a reputation for violence and that he carried weapons? Mr Dry answered: We have come to conclusion that she did not intend to happen what in fact did happen. Bramley, dressed in black top and black jeans, faces a sentence of up to six months in prison. In December last year, as he sentenced car dealer Saunders, Judge Ashurst rejected Saunders\u0027 defence that he did not intend to kill Michael. The court heard he carried a kitchen knife that he used to deliver a single fatal blow to the heart in the early hours of July 1 in Darlington.  During the hearing, the court heard that after performing the sex act on Michael and sending the photograph of it to Saunders, Sarah then slapped her lover and ordered him to leave the house. She is alleged to have texted Saunders saying: I have just smashed the lad clean in the face because he wouldn\u0027t go home. What have I got myself involved with? The court was told that she added: He is outside the house, feel free to smack the c***. Saunders admitted murder but sought to lower the minimum term he must serve by claiming he did not carry the knife to the scene and did not intend to kill Michael.

Hollie-Louise Brown has shared photos of her horrific injuries and admits she can barely look at herself in the mirror anymore. The 23-year-old says she thought she was going to die in the attack while out for a drink in Northumberland on Saturday night. She claims she was left unconscious on the nightclub floor. Her attackers allegedly scratched at her eyeballs and kicked her in the head, while she could \u0027hear the hair tearing from her scalp\u0027.  The telesales worker was left half bald and covered in cuts, bruises and cigarette burns. She feared she would not \u0027make it home to her children\u0027 during her 25-minute ordeal and later needed a CT scan to check for brain damage. Kind-hearted pals launched a fundraising page to help raise cash for hair treatment which has now raised \u0026pound1,250 - almost three times its initial target. Hollie-Louise, from Choppington, Northumberland, said: I\u0027m still in a lot of shock. I just can\u0027t stop sobbing every time I walk past the mirror. I\u0027m absolutely heartbroken at the state of myself. The attack was unprovoked and there was no reason for it. I didn\u0027t think it was ever going to stop. I could hear my hair being ripped out.  I wondered if I was going to make it home to my children or if I\u0027d even get to see them again. Hollie-Louise had been to Bubbles pub in Ashington, Northumberland, on Saturday night when she was allegedly attacked at around 1am. The single mum claims the incident started when a woman began dancing around her and \u0027bumping\u0027 into her. When Hollie-Louise confronted her, the woman allegedly leaped on her - while her friends tore at her hair. After falling to the floor, Hollie-Louise claims she was strangled and kicked to the head and body in a sustained attack that lasted around 25 minutes. Meanwhile, other women allegedly scratched at her eyes after someone shouted \u0027gouge out her eyes\u0027 from the sideline. Hollie-Louise claimed: She was bouncing around the dance floor and bumping into me on purpose. I asked her what she was doing and she pushed me.  I grabbed her and then all her friends began pulling at my hair and kicking me. We were rolling around the floor and they were all pulling at my hair. One of them was strangling me... I\u0027m almost bald now. By the time the attack had ended I didn\u0027t really know what was going on. One put my fingers in her mouth and was trying to bite. I was kicked in the head repeatedly. She added: My eyelashes are gone because of where they tried to scratch my eyeballs. It went on for ages - it was probably about 25 minutes. According to my friends I ended up unconscious on the floor.  After coming round, Hollie-Louise rushed home to her two sons, admitting she feared she\u0027d never see them again. Her dad helped her report it to the police and the next day she attended hospital and saw the police forensics team, who she claims confirmed that a cigarette had been deliberately put out on her. During the days following the incident, the mum\u0027s bruises reportedly worsened and she now fears the women will return. Hollie-Louise said: I went straight home because my dad was babysitting at my house and I needed to get back to my children. When I got in at around 1.45am, they were both awake when I got in and my oldest is only three, but he looked at me in shock because I looked so different. Obviously I was really upset and my hair had been pulled out.  I went to the forensic team at the police station. They confirmed they\u0027d put a cigarette out on me and I had scratches and bruises all over my body. My injuries have actually got worse since then because the bruising has come out. I went and had a CT scan because I\u0027d been kicked in the head. Luckily they said there was no permanent damage and it\u0027s just bruised. I\u0027ve also been given antibiotics because of the cigarette burns.

Away from the capital’s brainwashed elite, we found ordinary North Koreans struggling to survive. But we were constantly shadowed by Kim Jong-un’s security agents. The gleaming buildings of \u0026shyPyongyang portray an image of North Korean perfection Kim wants the world to see. Alongside the magnificent tower blocks across the city stand proud \u0026shymonuments of the dictator’s grandad Kim Il-sung and dad Kim Jong-il. Propaganda banners adorn bridges and pavements instructing the people to honour their leaders’ “sacrifice” fighting Japanese and US imperialists. But away from the city sparkle lies the true harsh reality of life under the Kims’ twisted version of socialism, where desperate peasant workers carry out backbreaking work and pick crops with their bare hands. And the Mirror was there to witness it after we gained unrivalled access to parts of the secretive country rarely seen by foreigners. During our exclusive eight-day stay we were able to travel more than 100 miles from the capital and saw first hand how the regime rules with an iron grip.  And as Kim showcases his \u0026shydevastating arsenal of military power in a muscle-flexing warning to the West, his ordinary subjects starve. Outside Pyongyang, home to three million of the brainwashed “elite”, lies a desolate countryside where 20 million farm workers scratch out a miserable \u0026shyexistence. Their toil remains the lifeblood of the nation while regime kingpins enjoy the fruits of their labour. Many millions of acres exist without even the most basic industrial machinery, in a land that claims to be one of the most advanced in the world and boasting of its ability to launch a nuclear attack on its enemies. The vast rivers which should be a bustling avenue of trade are devoid of activity, the scenery occasionally split up by a few labourers breaking rocks on the riverbed. Soldiers regularly survey the \u0026shypeasants’ work leading them to live in fear and act busy when they are near, even if there is nothing to do.  We saw one women pick up a stick and stare at the ground after being reprimanded by an official, a sign of the level of fear that exists in this dystopian dream-like nation. Kim’s nuclear ambitions have further crippled the country as \u0026shystringent sanctions have banned the trade deals it needs to survive. His meeting with US president Donald Trump promised to herald a new beginning for the country, with the despot vowing to dump his nukes and set his country on the path of economic development. And yet, despite the absence of the intercontinental ballistic missiles he has been so keen to show off in previous years, the warped a\u0026shyttitudes show no sign of fading. Western defence officials say North Korea is regularly employing \u0026shy“deceptive tactics to evade UN \u0026shysanctions” and have raised fears that Kim has no desire to deplete his nuclear capability. Satellite imagery of the Sanumdong facility near \u0026shyPyongyang has shown recent signs the regime is building one or possibly two ICBMs – the exact ones Trump wants Kim to give up or face even harsher global penalties.  But it would seem Kim’s loyal subjects stand by him too, which we discovered when at the behest of the regime we attended the incredible 70th anniversary celebrations of the country’s foundation on Sunday. One government official with us smiled broadly when asked if the lack of hardcore weaponry on show meant the regime was backing down to Trump. He said: “The Supreme Leader will never do anything that reduces our position when the threat against us is continual.” The Pyongyang parade involving 300,000 military and civilians was followed by a Mass Games in the world’s largest stadium featuring 100,000 performers, many of them children. It was a sight to behold. This was the best of the best and exactly what 35-year-old Kim and his cronies wanted us to see, believing we too would be convinced of both his and the nation’s power. He attended both events and waved enthusiastically to his subjects, whose deafening roars of support could leave no one in doubt of their devotion to their idol.  Kim’s regime contacted the Mirror after we exposed it for using child slaves to build railway lines in the country’s northern provinces in 2016. Following 18 months of tense \u0026shynegotiations, we managed to secure visas to enter in time for this week’s foundation anniversary. We were assigned senior officials from the Ministry of Information to act as our “guides”. They attempted to convince us of how the pariah state is an all-powerful yet inclusive nation, where everyone lives in “harmony and happiness to serve the country”.  While the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to the country a few thousand people a year can visit North Korea as “tourists”. Comedy actor Michael Palin, 75, next week releases a two-part \u0026shydocumentary that will apparently see him go “beyond the politics” in a bid to discover more about the everyday life of the secretive nation. But travelling with a tour company, like Palin, is unlikely to reveal the darker side to life that still exists.  The lack of free will was evident from the moment we stepped off the plane. We were given “press” armbands, not permitted to leave our hotel without our minders and kept in a constant state of limbo over arrangements for our stay. We would often be kept in the dark for hours and then need to leave at a moment’s notice. A complete ban on advertising, state TV stations dedicated to pumping out propaganda dressed up as news and \u0026shyentertainment, all bolster Kim’s surging popularity and \u0026shycontributes to the desensitisation of the entire \u0026shypopulation.  From as soon as they are able, children are ordered to \u0026shyrepeatedly chant the name of the “Supreme Leader” and devote their lives to serving him and the memory of the “great leaders” Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. This despite them presiding over years of devastating war, famine and isolation. But while the rest of the country struggles to survive, the city folk keep up the pretence of utopia, among the shiny buildings Pyongyang’s tallest is the 105 storey, 330m tall Ryugyong Hotel.

Nothing is quite what it seems. A folding factory chair is encased in a glass box because the visiting Supreme Leader once sat upon it. A spanking modern six-lane motorway is all but deserted. And a factory boss sheds what look like genuine tears over the dangers faced by roly-poly dictator Kim Jong-un on his foreign visits. We take tea with a “normal” family, speak to student teachers, witness “world class” cosmetics being made and see how an “idyllic co-op farm” operates. But from the moment we arrive, senior officials from the Ministry of Information watch our every move. We are ordered not go \u0026shyany\u0026shy\u0026shywhere or talk to anyone without them. And we are warned that if we are seen without our government-issued “Press” armbands we will face immediate expulsion. Officials delight in telling us how “extremely privileged” we are to be there after previously daring to report on “untruths”. We will soon see for ourselves the reality of “great Korea” where all live in “happiness and harmony”.  As mother-of-two Sung Song Gi shows us round her Pyongyang apartment, I can’t help notice the triumphant photographs and posters covering the walls. As chief of a glass factory, she had been allowed to attend the latest summit of the Congress of the Work\u0026shyers’ Party of Korea. She was one of just 3,000 \u0026shydelegates. We are, indeed, in most distinguished company. With introductions out of the way, Mrs Sung does not hesitate to sing the party line. What she says, according to our government minder, is: “In Korea, we are one heart united and this is our reality. “The Korean people are always thinking and feeling as one, united as one heart. “I am proud of this – that our Supreme Leader is the best leader in the world and I am happy that he is the leader of us in Korea.”  The Supreme Leader was re-elected unanimously at the May 2016 meeting. Nobody was very surprised as the “Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” is a one-party state ruled with an iron fist by Kim, the third in line of a family dynasty in power since 1948. Intrigued, I press her on whether she thinks everyone – even the farmers who toil in the fields – believe as she does. Mrs Sung replies: “We believe the party will provide everything for us for we are all the same, the worker in the factory, the road sweeper, the farmer. “You will find it difficult to believe this is true but this is the reality that we are all looked after by the Workers’ Party. Our Supreme leader Kim Jong-Un always says that is the happiness of all the Korean peoples. “This is the principle, this is the policy for us. We are happy and proud to be working for the country to move forward.”  Mrs Sung introduces her daughter and son-in-law, who treat us to world-class operatic piano performances. Then, slightly oddly, they switch to Phantom of the Opera followed by Sinatra classic My Way. Mrs Sung weeps when speaking of Kim’s summer meetings in Singapore with Donald Trump and in China with Premier Xi. The tears are not because of fears of an increase in sanctions that are currently crippling the economy but for Kim’s safety travelling “to foreign lands”. She says: “I am always wor\u0026shy\u0026shyrying about our Supreme Leader when he travels.  “When he was in Singapore having the meeting or visiting China three times, during his long trips abroad I am always thinking about him and worried about his health. “This is how all Korean people think. I am always thinking about him. “My life is connected to the Supreme leader’s life, that is why I am always thinking and worrying about him.”  When pressed on how \u0026shysanctions – a result of Kim’s obsession to have nuclear weapons – are affecting the country she says: “I will just tell you this… the righteous will always have victory. “In my experience, all our great leaders always are thinking about the people. They devote their whole life for the Korean people. That’s why they go abroad for us. So we believe if we work along the way for the country, our leaders will lead us to happiness. “So the righteous will always get victory no matter what.”  Throughout the rest of our stay, guides take us to factories and a farm where on the surface everything seems idyllic. But, like the folding factory chair encased in a glass box, the constant absurdity of the situations we encounter are becoming apparent. On the motorway we coun\u0026shyt exactly 27 cars, 13 buses and 11 lorries in two hours.  We see pristine accommodation for 400 workers at a silk factory – but no signs of anyone living there. The co-operative farm for 1,300 workers, with brand new flats, a nursery, gym and medical centre, has just two farmers in a greenhouse. They stand under a red-and- white propaganda banner that reads “Let’s produce more \u0026shyvegetables to supply the \u0026shyPyongyang citizens”. One says: “I am so happy to work to contribute to my Korea and believe our leader will help us prosper always”.

Not so much the kidnapping of the grandson of the richest man in the world... such wealth will always attract the wrong kind of attention. No, it was incredulity at J Paul Getty’s refusal to pay the ransom when 16-year-old John Paul Getty III was abducted by the Roman Mafia in 1973. In the end he was held for five months and only returned after much negotiation about reducing the 17million ransom and the encouragement of a cut-off ear from the criminals. Now no less than Danny Boyle, the mastermind of that spectacular London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, is causing controversy with a TV drama about the saga, which started this week. In BBC2’s Trust he suggests victim John Paul Getty III, known as Little Paul, came up with the plan for the kidnap in the first place. This week Little Paul’s wife has confirmed for the first time he did discuss such an idea with her in advance of the crime. Gisela Getty said he speculated about his own kidnap, aiming to use the profits to create an arts colony paradise in Marrakech, where LSD would flood the water supply.  Gisela, now 69, admits: “We wanted to do something better with the money than they did – to make a better world, but it got us into very deep waters.” The money “wasn’t to make us rich. It was really to bring our vision into the material world”. This “vision” consisted of 10 “crazy ideas a day” cooked up by Little Paul, Gisela and her twin sister, Jutta Winkelmann. In their hippy world of nightclubs and political demonstrations, Little Paul shared a bed with both of the radical German sisters, known as the “It girls” of Rome, in his “Dungeon” – a squalid basement with no windows. The daughters of a Nazi SS officer, the twins were already famous in their native Germany when they moved to Rome in early 1973. At 23, they were seven years his senior, and the trio envisioned a left-wing utopia. In TV’s Trust, a different story is suggested that Little Paul owed money because he had run up drug bills with the Mafia, with him saying in one scene: “You can take me and get the money from my grandfather.” But Gisela maintains that he abandoned his plan, saying: “I think he was taken against his will, against his wishes.”  For four decades Gisela, mother of the actor Balthazar Getty with Little Paul as well as Anna from a previous marriage, has not broken the Getty family’s code of silence. But the death of Jutta from cancer last year and the release of fictional dramas of the story have made her speak out. The first was Ridley Scott’s 2017 film All the Money in the World – for which disgraced Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer, 88, as the miserly John Paul Getty. In interviews since the release of the 10-episode Trust in America earlier this year, Gisela says: “One day Paul said, ‘I have talked to people. I have this idea to let myself be kidnapped and then get a place in Morocco. I am his favourite grandson. It is all going to be a matter of a week or so.’” Gisela says no one, Little Paul included, really took the idea seriously. That was until the Mafia got involved. Little Paul was friendly with the gangsters who kidnapped him, Gisela says, selling paintings in exchange for drugs.  But then Gisela and Jutta’s lives came under threat. They were told by a Mafia boss called Ciambellone he wanted to invest in a film they were making, but he lured them into a trap. The twins were kept for two days by cocaine-fuelled captors. During their ordeal, they were tied up, threatened with rape and strangulation and forced to watch pornography. Ciambellone stabbed himself because Jutta refused to be his mistress. “There was blood all over the floor,” says Gisela, who later had an affair with Dennis Hopper.The twins managed to break free and insisted Little Paul cut all ties with his Mafia “friends”. Weeks later, he vanished. Little Paul had been thrown into the back of a van and put in a cave more than 300 miles south of Rome. The Mafia killed his pet bird and played Russian roulette against his head when a ransom note was rejected by his grandfather, who despite being worth 2billion had payphones for guests at his Surrey mansion. “I have 14 grandchildren,” he said. “If I pay a penny I’ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren.”  He suspected the plot was about Little Paul trying to extort money from him. Meanwhile, the victim’s father was desperately trying to get the ransom together. Then, in November 1973, a torn, bloody ear was sent to a newspaper. A letter read: “This is Paul’s first ear. If within 10 days the family still believes that this is a joke mounted by him, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.” He developed pneumonia after what was left of his injured ear became infected. His grandad eventually stumped up the cash but only as much as was tax deductible, lending a further 1million to his son Big Paul, John Paul’s father – as long as he repaid it plus 4% interest. Gisela says Little Paul, a “lovely naive boy”, never fully recovered from the “tragic experience” which left him physically and emotionally scarred. The ear in the post “was so terrifying, beyond words”, she says. “It was the cruellest and most unimaginable thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mutant calf born two heads","story":"NewsMutant calf born with two heads and three eyes stuns owners by survivingCows with are genetic disorders usually don\u0027t survive for long but this one has defied the oddsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMark Morris18:19, 13 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/world-news/video/mutant-cow-walks-around-happily-13239796,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mutant calf born with two heads and three eyes has stunned its owners - by surviving.

The discovery, made up of a long series of \u0027sinister-looking\u0027 structures, has sparked speculation and conspiracy theories. Spanning more than a mile, it was spotted by an online paranormal investigator, known as \u0027Conspiracy Depot\u0027 on Google Earth.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday.

It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united pair fyvie and king continue on their road to recovery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United pair Fraser Fyvie and Billy King continued their comebacks from injury in the Reserve League Cup on Tuesday.The two made their first appearances of the season in the Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Alloa at the weekend.After coming on late on against the Wasps, this time club captain Fyvie and winger King were both given the full first half.That puts them well down the road to a first-team return, though it would be a major surprise if either were to feature in Saturday’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice.After being out since Christmas, Fyvie, in particular, is likely to continue his build-up in the reserves for another couple of weeks.The plan for him is to have him back only once he’s completed a full game for the second string.Their presence saw them help the Tangerines to a 2-1 win over Saints, though both United goals came late in the second period.Matty Smith, with his second goal in two games, levelled after Saints had gone ahead through Jordan Northcott.United then sealed the points from the opening group game when Louis Appere struck 18 minutes from the end.United, meanwhile, have switched their crucial Championship clash at Partick Thistle next month.The game was originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 30, but with both teams’ interest in this season’s Irn-Bru at an end, they’ve brought it forward to Saturday, October 13, with a 3pm kick-off.As well as suiting fans, it means both teams will avoid a three-game week at the end of the month.Had United progressed in the Irn-Bru they would have faced Dunfermline in the third round.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/V_A-Dundee_Scotland_©HuftonCrow_082-588x564.jpg ","title":"french journalist says dundee is very well known due to va as media from across the world visit city","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe eyes of the world will be on Dundee for the next few days, as the V\u0026ampA finally opens the doors to its new £80 million design museum on the city’s Waterfront.After months of anticipation fuelled by teaser images, artists’ impressions and 3D fly-through videos, the media was given its first look at the inside of Kengo Kuma’s distinctive structure.Journalists and television crews from across the globe were are all in Dundee for the great unveiling.The V\u0026ampA’s tourism officer Alice Kennedy said journalists from China, Japan, Canada, America, France, Spain and Germany were due to visit the museum over the next few days.Alice said: “We expected media interest from all over the world but this is exceeding our expectations.\u0026nbsp“Foreign journalists here will be spreading the word about the museum across the globe.“There is a huge interest in the museum and in Dundee as a result. 100vw, 588px\" /“We are confident this will help to bring thousands of visitors to the city.”Hiroyuki Kikko from Nippon Television in Tokyo said interest in the museum went beyond the fact it was built by a Japanese architect.He said: “We’re here because of Kengo Kuma’s involvement and we want to announce the museum to Japanese people.“We hope our broadcasts will encourage Japanese visitors to come to Dundee.“This museum has captured global interest. That’s why we’re here.”Tristan De Bourbon Parme from Le Journal des Arts in Paris said the museum had surpassed expectations.“There was a perception that it would be an extension of the V\u0026ampA in London but now I understand that is not the case, and that this is a significant museum in its own right,” he said.“I’m sure this is going to draw visitors from all over the world.“It is an amazing asset for Dundee to have. It will surely become a major tourist attraction and I can definitely see people from France coming to visit.“Dundee has become very well known on the international stage recently and there’s no doubt the museum has played a major part in that.“I’ve been in Dundee a couple of times before and each time I come I see another change and development.”If the shape of the outside of the museum is difficult for people to get their heads around, the inside is even more mind-boggling.The walls are lined with wood panels, in stark contrast to the concrete exterior, and the floor is made of Irish limestone.There are thousands of fossilised remains set in the stone, in a further nod to Kuma’s love of the natural world. 100vw, 580px\" /But just like the outside, the interior building twists and turns as you walk through it, with not one straight wall in sight.As you make your way from the entrance, which is virtually hidden at the far end of the building, into the main reception area, the building opens up – and a grand staircase takes you up to the vast exhibition spaces.Speaking at the unveiling of his masterpiece, Kuma said: “I am truly in love with the Scottish landscape and nature – I was inspired by the cliffs of north east Scotland.“I hope the museum can change the city and become its centre of gravity.”Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “This building has made a significant impact on Dundee even before it has opened.“It signifies a renewed confidence, a renewed pride and a fire in the belly.“For too long our city has been seen as a poor relation but that is changing.“The people of Dundee have bought into the cultural led regeneration and they see this building as theirs.”Following the visits by journalists, a select group of people – who won competitions run by DC Thomson, including the Evening  – will become the first members of the public to get inside the museum on Friday for an exclusive tour.Then on Saturday the building opens up fully, with those who were successful in securing tickets becoming the first official visitors to the attraction.Sunday is also ticket-only, before the free-to-enter museum begins normal operations on Monday – though visitors will have to pay for certain exhibitions.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b80270a0c53e-846x564.jpg ","title":"new peoples piano installed at dundee station thanks to fundraiser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe generosity of Dundonians has been hailed after a new \u0026#8216People\u0026#8217s Piano\u0026#8217 was installed at the city\u0026#8217s rail station.It comes after the original piano, which was donated by Dundee man David Patterson to honour his late wife and Scotrail worker Jean, was vandalised by yobs.Mr Paterson\u0026#8217s idea was to place the piano in the station to allow anyone to sit down and play a tune for fellow travellers.Local man Greg Joiner quickly set up an online crowdfunding page to replace the piano.

irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most significant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited return from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the difference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he returns to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his return capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the pitch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b97b51d1205c-848x564.jpg ","title":"well help to find work jobcentre bosses pledge help for dundee

While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a difficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see if that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the division.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but, if it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/CITY-CIRCLE-360-map-1808-FINAL2-1-1-564x564.jpg ","title":"xplore dundee takes leap of faith with launch of new service that stops off at all city centre attractions","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLocal bus firm Xplore Dundee is ready to take a “leap of faith” next week when it launches a new city centre service on a three-month trial.The 360 City Circle bus will link all of the centre\u0026#8217s tourist attractions in a single 20-minute route, connecting the bus and train stations along the way.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore, said the firm was stepping into the unknown with the new route.But she hopes tourists and locals alike will embrace the service during its trial run.“This is the right time to run a service like this,” said Christine.“We want to help people get around the city centre easily and folk have been calling out for a service like this for years.“It really is a leap of faith though – we’re just taking a chance on something we think people will use.“And if ever there was a time to try it out, it’s now.“Hopefully, we can get make a big success of it – we need people to get on board for that.”Xplore has secured the loan of a £220,000 demonstrator bus from Northern Irish firm Wrightbus for the three-month trial.Tourists boarding the bus – which has eye-catching electric green livery featuring graphics of city landmarks – can pick up a brochure showing them the full route, as well as links to other services to places further afield, such as Broughty Ferry.The all-electric bus can operate all day without having to be charged, running from 8am-5.30pm at a fixed price of £3 for adults and £2 for children.Should the trial be considered a success, Xplore hopes to either extend its lease of the bus or find money to buy one of its own.Christine added: “The fact is there is a need for this service.“If it is successful, then brilliant – but if need be, we will look into subsidies such as low emission grants and tourism grants to keep it going.“It will all depend on how people use it.“We’re looking into things such as a recording played over the speakers telling people about their next stops, and tying it into tickets like Plusbus, which you can buy when you buy a train ticket to Dundee.“It’s trying to cater for all – local people to give them the connectivity, and people coming in to discover the city.”The Tele joined the 360’s inaugural run around the 2.65-mile route, taking in the Waterfront, Overgate, Verdant Works, McManus and Foxlake.The eco-friendly bus – which can recapture energy lost during braking to keep the battery charged – is zero-emission, apart from a tiny diesel generator used to heat the interior.Among the passengers on the City Circle’s first run were city council development chief Mike Galloway, North East Labour MSP Jenny Marra and local B\u0026ampB owners Barrie and Olwyn Jack. Mr Galloway said: “With the Waterfront coming to fruition and becoming a reality, a service linking everything together is another piece in the puzzle.“I hope it is really successful and does well.”Ms Marra said: “I think it’s great – the more public transport in Dundee the better it is for getting around.“It’s also really important that they’re using an economical bus. It’s great for the environment and I would like to see even more environmentally-friendly buses in the area.”Barrie and Olwyn, who run Duntrune House north of the city, say they think the 360 is a “great idea”.Olwyn added: “It’s excellent for people who come into Dundee that don’t have their bearings, linking everything up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"                          A BUS driver faces being sacked by Glasgow City Council after pulling over a coach load of Celtic fans to attack a rival motorist."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-independence-movement-in-great-health-as-snp-continues-to-build-fresh-case","story":"                          The independence movement is in \"great health,\" according to SNP depute leader Keith Brown after the party\u0027s biggest ever national assembly meeting."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-legend-frank-mcgarvey-to-join-yes-campaigners-at-rally-in-george-square","story":"                          CELTIC legend Frank McGarvey will join yes campaigners in Glasgow at the Hope Over Fear rally on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-extra-tour-dates-and-takes-aim-at-touts-with-strict-rules","story":"                          Glasgow singer-songwriter Gerry Cinnamon has added extra dates to his latest tour."},{"url":null,"title":"lord-haughey-on-hampden-donation-i-did-it-for-glasgow","story":"                          Lord Willie Haughey, the Glasgow businessman who donated cash to help save Hampden said he did for Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"buchanan-galleries-to-open-store-showcasing-the-hottest-new-fashion-and-jewellery-designers","story":"                          HUNDREDS of fashion and jewellery designers, artists and photographers will enjoy coveted high street exposure with the launch of a brand new enterprise in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"pop-up-food-and-drink-event-taking-place-in-south-side-bar","story":"                          FOODIES in Glasgow\u0027 South Side will have the opportunity to sample a meal alongside Italian craft beers in a converted Piaggio Ape van."},{"url":null,"title":"youre-a-f-joker-mugger-screams-insult-at-woman-for-having-2-in-purse","story":"                          A MASKED thug who robbed a woman at knifepoint and then shouted at her because she only had \u0026pound2 in her purse was\u0026nbspjailed for 63 months."},{"url":null,"title":"apology-issued-as-1761-women-not-invited-for-final-breast-screening-appointment","story":"                          Almost 1,800 women are being contacted by the NHS after it emerged they were not invited for breast screening appointments."},{"url":null,"title":"first-minister-backs-bid-to-save-asylum-seeker-schoolboys","story":"                          FIRST Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged her support for a campaign to stop two asylum seeker brothers from being deported from Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"                          AN English couple have decided to raffle off their \u0026pound3 million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117403.jpg","title":"Business is picking up for contest","story":"\u0026nbspBUSINESS ideas could become reality for lucky entrants to this year\u0027 University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition.Successful entrants will win a share of a \u0026pound6500 prize pot.

Grantown-on-Spey and Dunvegan on Skye will both find themselves with the same MP under the proposals \u0026ndash despite being separated by 158 miles.The Boundary Commission for Scotland has defended its proposals, arguing that population limits for each new constituency had tied its hands over the revised boundaries.It said: \"We noted that many respondents had objected to the size of the constituencies in the revised proposals, particularly Highland North, and that these objections were understandable.\"We considered, however, that the requirements in legislation with regard to the number of electors in each constituency and the low population density of the areas in question meant creating large constituencies could not be avoided.\"Friday 14 Sep 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117491.jpg","title":"Shop staff begin charity bike ride for Sam","story":"\u0026nbspCo-op staff from across the Highlands are taking on the North Coast 500 to raise funds for the Step Up for Sam campaign.Workers from 19 branches left Telford Street store on Sunday September 9, and are due to arrive back in the Highland capital tomorrow.The 559-mile trip marks the end of the three-month fundraising drive for the charity, which aims to fund vital treatment for three-year-old Sam Douglas.The youngster has an undiagnosed neurological condition which causes epilepsy and developmental delay, and requires intensive therapies, many of which are not available on the NHS.Invergordon store manager Lorraine Davidson, whose idea it was to support the campaign, said: \"It\u0027 a huge endurance challenge but all in aid of a very special little boy.\"We\u0026rsquove all been incredibly touched by Sam\u0027 story and can\u0026rsquot wait to see just how much we\u0026rsquove raised from our in-store fundraising and the sponsored cycle event.\"Co-op area manager Daniel Simpson added: \"We really wanted to set ourselves a big challenge and we\u0026rsquove certainly done that in the North Coast 500.\"It\u0027 not for the faint hearted but is very befitting of this very worthy cause.\"Friday 14 Sep 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117408.jpg","title":"Sisters aim to save school lives","story":"\u0026nbspTwo sisters are aiming to save lives by installing defibrillators in schools.Paige Glendinning , a pupil at Culloden Academy, and her sister Alicia  who attends Cradlehall Primary, have organised a night with medium Tommy Goodwin in order to raise funds for the vital equipment for the two schools.The pair have been hard at work organising the event, which will be held on September 22 at the Chieftain Hotel.\"Our mum got some defibrillator training at work, and there was a man speaking whose 12-year-old son had died,\" Paige said.\"Then a paramedic said that there was an eight-year-old who had survived because there was a defibrillator there.\"That\u0027 what gave us the idea, because it could happen to anyone.\"The sisters have taken on the bulk of the work themselves, encouraging local businesses to get involved in the event.They have convinced several companies to donate items for the raffle and auction, including Culloden House Hotel, Dalmahoy Golf Course, Boots, Inverness Kart Raceway, Dores Inn, and Drumossie Hotel.\"I\u0026rsquove been approaching companies and delivering the pitch,\" Paige said.\"There have been a lot of late nights and it\u0027 been hard but it\u0027 been worth it.\"It\u0027 nice that the companies are giving something to the community.

It was almost like a gun to their head because they would have been left with massive debt if the SFA left Hampden.”As a player and manager McInally has plenty of happy memories of Hampden.He played in the Dundee United side that won the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1994, beating Rangers 1-0 in the final.Another special moment in that run was getting the winner against Aberdeen in the semi-final replay.McInally added: “We won the Scottish Cup which was great, but a massive moment for me came in the semi-final when I scored the winner against Aberdeen.“As a wee boy I always dreamed of scoring the winner at Hampden in a big game so that fulfilled a dream for me.”Another memory for McInally was playing for Scotland against Brazil at Hampden in the 2-0 loss in the 1987 Rous Cup.He said: “It was something I had wanted to do all my life was play against Brazil.“But I went into it off the back of losing the UEFA Cup final over two legs to Gothenburg that week.“Then we’d lost the Scottish Cup final to St Mirren so I was really down mentally.

I’ll never forget, he came back up and said ‘You’ll need to see Andy Roxburgh, you’re playing because I’m injured.’“It was great, though. I remember the first half because Brazil had Josimar at right-back who everyone was raving about and the late, great Davie Cooper ran him ragged.“The other memory was standing on the line defending a corner and a Brazilian volleyed it from about five yards straight into my face. But it was a brilliant occasion.”Another memory for McInally was playing for the last Scottish League select against Scotland in 1990, with the select team winning 1-0 courtesy of Hans Gillhaus’ penalty.As a manager he guided Peterhead to the 2016 Challenge Cup final at Hampden against Rangers.McInally said: “The select game got me back in the Scotland squad. I played well that day and won the penalty when Andy Goram brought me down.“It’s a game nobody will remember but it’s unique to say you played in a team that beat Scotland at Hampden.“The Challenge Cup final was great.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt.

What are your views on improving these?DM: \u0026#8216Obviously these are vitally important for rural areas. What Argyll and Bute Council wants to do as part of the Rural Growth Deal is to have the highest possible broadband speeds.\u0026#8216You are not going to get people to live in or visit rural areas if they don\u0026#8217t get the level of connectivity they are accustomed to. It is right at the centre of the consideration in this deal and I am very supportive of it.\u0026#8217AA: Another potential obstacle to economic development in Argyll and Bute is transport links, given the region\u0026#8217s unique geography. Would you support the development of fixed links such as tunnels and bridges for this area?DM: \u0026#8216These are much more a matter for the Scottish Government, as roads and transport are devolved, but it\u0026#8217s self-evident that to get products such as seafood to market quickly you need to have those transport links.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m sure the council will be pitching to the Scottish Government to have those transport links improved. I also think it is worth looking at how other island communities deal with these sort of problems.\u0026#8217AA: Would Westminster support such projects financially after Brexit?DM: \u0026#8216Up until the point we\u0026#8217ve formally left the EU, all funding arrangements are guaranteed. Beyond that we will be looking to put in place the \u0026#8216Shared Prosperity Fund\u0026#8217, which will be the equivalent of EU structural and other funding.\u0026#8216We will shortly be consulting on the form the Shared Prosperity Fund should take.\u0026#8217AA: RBS has threatened to close its Inveraray branch, having already closed branches in dozens of other towns including Campbeltown and Rothesay since the turn of the year. What are your thoughts on this, from a UK government perspective?DM: \u0026#8216The first thing to say is that it isn\u0026#8217t possible, contrary to what some people have suggested, for the government to tell RBS what to do. While the government is a shareholder, it is not running RBS.\u0026#8216My own view is that the approach of RBS over these branch closures demonstrates that they do not place any importance on serving rural Scotland. I have encouraged people to play a full part in the consultations over threatened branches.\u0026#8216I do think we have to be very alive to the wider issues about people being able to get access to cash in rural areas. That\u0026#8217s something the government is very cogniscant of.\u0026#8216RBS have demonstrated no commitment to rural areas and that is very disappointing.\u0026#8217AA: Is Scotland ready for Brexit?DM: \u0026#8216I hope so. What we\u0026#8217re trying to do in relation to Brexit is get the best possible deal, and I still believe it\u0026#8217s possible to get a deal.\u0026#8216I want to see everyone rallying around the Prime Minister and her proposal, which meets the needs of Scotland by continuing to have close trading links with the EU whilst ensuring that we do, in fact, leave in acordance with peoples\u0026#8217 wishes in the referendum.\u0026#8216It will ensure that we leave the Common Fisheries Policy and Common Agricultural Policy \u0026#8211  but have that trading relationship with the EU.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"feorlins bake sale for nannie meg","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/09/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNine-year-old Feorlin Renton\u0026#8217s coffee morning was a great success, raising more than £750 for Macmillan Cancer Support.The Inveraray Primary School pupil ran and hosted a coffee morning in Nicoll Hall in memory of her grandma.Feorlin said: ‘Three years ago my Nannie passed away.

What’s more, even if they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here, if released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientific journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentified crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identified as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice difficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fife, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

It is a place precious to many who come to seek solitude and appreciate the remote and beautiful landscape. It is impossible to mitigate the visual impact. Its presence alone would remove the wilderness and scenic qualities valued by many.\u0026#8217The area is designated ‘Wild Land’ and ‘Area of Panoramic Quality’ and lies within the Inner Hebrides and The Minches Special Area of Conservation , she said, and is \u0026#8216rich in rare wildlife\u0026#8217, such as harbour porpoises, dolphins, and minke, killer and sei whales.\u0026#8216The plan shows Acoustic Deterrent Devices  would be used to deter seals. Cetaceans can be displaced by ADDs at ranges of 7km. The cumulative impact will be devastating to these species.\u0026#8216Impacts from lice, disease, pesticides and waste, to not only wild fish, but other marine life is unacceptable. The estates on Islay and Jura work hard to conserve and enhance their local native populations.\u0026#8216The proposal is flawed: there has been no consideration to the exposed nature of the site and the high potential for escaped stock and mooring instability of the cages.\u0026#8216There has been no hydrodynamic modelling, no benthic  biology survey submitted, maximum stocking biomass has been increased to levels for which further investigations are needed and fallow periods are unsustainably short. Impacts to other wildlife have not been considered.\u0026#8216A promise of six jobs, whilst sacrificing a rare wild landscape and unspoiled marine habitats, is not appropriate nor sustainable economic development.\u0026#8217Stuart Cannon, managing director of Kames Fish Farming Limited, said it is \u0026#8216an environmentally responsible company which has produced high quality, sustainable fish for more than 45 years.\u0026#8216We are very much aware there is a balance to be struck, and would not want to place a site where there would be risk to the amazing biodiversity we have on the west coast.\u0026#8216We have withdrawn applications in the past where the scientific assessment of the site has suggested the site is not suitable. We require new sites to meet the growing demand for our product and want to place these sites in areas deemed suitable by the application process.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"re tune alert for argyll freeview users","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 13/09/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFreeview viewers in parts of Argyll may need to re-tune their TV equipment on Wednesday September 19 to continue watching some programmes.Some Freeview channels are moving to new airwaves to allow for the development of new mobile broadband services.Transmitters affected include a number in the central belt as well as Millport and Tighnabruaich.Further changes will take place at transmitters in parts of Scotland on Wednesday October 3.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shifting and phasing with each melody sounding very different depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr man take part great","story":"NewsAyr man take part in Great Scottish Run in memory of late wife and unborn sonCharity event as tribute to Holly, 23, who died of cystic fibrosisShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning12:57, 11 SEP 2018Updated12:59, 11 SEP 2018NewsHolly Chapman, 23, of Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn Ayr man will put his best foot forward in memory of his late wife and unborn son who died in March. Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant wife, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days. Joe added: “The specialist advised if she didn’t improve, that we should consider aborting our baby. On March 13, Holly became so ill that we decided it was time to let her be at peace and we made the decision to turn off her ventilator. Holly left the world far too young due to this horrible disease. “Cystic fibrosis is a really common disease but not many people know much about it which I why I decided to take part in the Great Scottish Run, to raise awareness and also raise vital funds for the trust.” You can sponsor Joe via his JustGiving page: https:www.justgiving/fundraising/joe-chapman9Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCystic FibrosisCharityAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrs station hotel undergo 24","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel to undergo 24 hour rescue operation aimed at re-opening platforms to ScotRail trainsThe crumbling building is the subject of a large exclusion zone which has rendered much of Ayr station a no-go zone.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:43, 11 SEP 2018NewsStation Hotel in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA painstaking mission aimed at re-opening parts of Ayr railway station is to get underway. Safety teams will work 24 hours a day to try and get the hub moving again. Work, which begins this Saturday, is expected to last until mid-October. Council bosses hope their move will reduce the extended exclusion zone which has paralysed the town\u0027s train station. Services to Glasgow Central are currently restricted in size with all six carriage trains halting at Prestwick Town. All trains south of Ayr are cancelled. Contractors are now set to move in with the aim of reinstating those lost services. Council chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: The extended exclusion zone at the train station – and its impact on rail services – is far from ideal, but we’ve had to take this action to keep people safe and that’s something we cannot, and will not, take any chances with. Our priority right now is to do what’s needed to allow the extended exclusion zone to be reduced when safe to do so and for rail services to get back to normal, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  Once that has been achieved, we will continue to progress the wider programme of public safety works as well as the works to complete a structural survey, which will help inform the next steps with regards to the building’s future.   Andrew Mackie, Transport Scotland’s Head of Rail Franchising, added: In the longer term, any solution identified must contribute to the economic prosperity of the town centre and the communities south of Ayr currently without a train service.  This means we need to explore all the available options for dealing with the Station Hotel property which, in its current state, presents a significant safety risk not only to the railway line but also the immediate vicinity.  Only by continuing to work in close partnership with the relevant agencies and the local community can we reach an effective solution for everyone concerned - particularly those passengers, the local community and businesses directly affected.   ScotRail Head of Service Planning, Dave Smith, said: The beginning of the works to remove the extended exclusion zone is a fantastic step forward and until then we are working flat out to keep our customers moving.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her life now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a divorced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no life, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my life was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horrific surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

It\u0026rsquos subjective.\n\u0026ldquoThe officers and the consultees have expressed reservations, even though they might not have objected.\n\u0026ldquoI think when you join together all these different aspects, of the reservoir, of the William Ogilvie cairn, the cumulative and residential impacts, in my view that makes this application unacceptable.\nA report put to the committee found that 75 comments had been submitted to Scottish Borders Council regarding the project, and all but one of those were objections.\nThe council also received objections from six community councils that would be within sight of the wind farm, and Hawick councillors David Paterson and Watson McAteer also voiced their objections.\nThe latter wrote to his fellow councillors, imploring them to reject the wind farm: \u0026ldquoThis application is a test and should this authority grant the application it is in danger of sending a signal to all developers that rejection is simply a temporary set back and that after some fine tuning reapplication is likely to be successful.\n\u0026ldquoThis approach is debilitating for fragile communities who are being worn down by commercial enterprises that bring financial muscle to a process destined to create over proliferation, landscape desecration and wind turbine blight to a naturally beautiful area of the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoMembers, those I represent can see no valid reason why the previous rejection is not equally valid today and it is your responsibility to ensure that this community is listened to.\n\u0026ldquoIt is quite ridiculous that those who live and nurture this area are once again being called to fight to protect a precious environment, that includes a perilous roads network, from a profit centred business who have no interest in the effect their development will have on such a historic rural community.\nNot all councillors opposed the development, however, with East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing proposing a motion to support officer\u0026rsquos recommendations and approve the application, which Tweeddale East councillor Eric Small seconded.\nCouncillor Laing said the revised plans were a big improvement on the 2012 application: \u0026ldquoI think there has been a significant change to what they have proposed.\n\u0026ldquoI do have my concerns, particularly around the impact on nearby properties, but on balance I am supportive of the officer\u0026rsquos recommendations. There are lots of advantages to this.\nDespite councillor Laing and councillor Small\u0026rsquos support for the bid, the remaining five members of the committee voted to reject the proposals.\nSpeaking after the meeting, ABO Wind\u0026rsquos head of development, Clark Crosbie, said: \u0026ldquoWe are extremely disappointed by the decision of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee.\n\u0026ldquoWe have worked very closely and collaboratively with a wide range of stakeholders over the past few years to develop this project and we believe very strongly that it complied with all relevant technical and planning requirements.\n\u0026ldquoThe site is located well outside the area being discussed for a proposed Borders national park, has good wind resource, a readily available electricity grid connection, proven turbine delivery route and is relatively isolated.\n\u0026ldquoIt is also located in an area identified in the council\u0026rsquos finalised renewable energy supplementary guidance, dated March 2018, as having the highest capacity for wind turbine development.\n\u0026ldquoWe were especially disappointed with the decision, given that the application was presented at the planning committee with no objections from any of the statutory consultees and was recommended for approval by the council\u0026rsquos own chief planning officer.\n\u0026ldquoWe

councillors voted to allow its demolition.\nSt Aidan\u0026rsquos Church, in Gala Park, is set to face the wrecking ball after the owners, Cumbria-based Book Development, concluded that renovating the B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building. It depresses me, but I can\u0026rsquot see any other option but to approve this as pretty much all options have been reasonably explored, so it\u0026rsquos with a heavy heart that I vote with the officer\u0026rsquos recommendation.\nGalashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison also supported the recommendation to allow the demolition but said he would be sad to see it go, adding: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a huge emotional issue in terms of buildings and things which are of historic significance.\n\u0026ldquoI worry about the future of built environments. Take our capital city for example. There are some huge historical buildings, and the upkeep of these buildings is hugely expensive.\n\u0026ldquoWhat are we going to do with them? They can\u0026rsquot all be Wetherspoons.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a sad reflection of society that many have gone that way.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

Gun, Molly\u0027s Lips and Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam.\nBut away from the Cobain links The Vaselines are rightly regarded as one of Scotland\u0027s best-loved alternative bands from the late 80s and early 90s.\nFormed in 1987 by Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, they instantly became indie favourites with their pop-punk influenced songs.\nDespite becoming hugely popular on home soil during their two years together neither their studio album Dum Dum or two singles reached the charts.\nBut they have enjoyed greater success since reforming a decade ago.\nAfter a few performances at charity shows in Glasgow they began touring once more in 2008 and 2009.\nThe re-release of Enter the Vaselines led to a tour of the United States and a booking to play Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona.\nA stunning new album Sex With an X was released in 2010, followed four years later by equally fantastic V for Vaselines.\nThe Vaselines toured with the likes of Future Islands and Mogwai as their popularity soared.\nAnd they have continued to sell-out venues all over the world with their infectious pop-punk sets.\nThe Vaselines will play MacArts in Galashiels on Saturday, December

last week, when retired local GP John Wilson undertook the same 87-mile cycle ride made in 1916 by the town\u0026rsquos legendary medical practitioner, Dr John Muir, at the age of 71.\nDr Muir served the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his family life and his day-to-day dealings with the public in a series of diaries.\nIn 2014, some 40 of Dr Muir\u0026rsquos diaries were presented by his descendants to the Scottish Borders Archive \u0026amp Local History Service, and these were then transcribed by staff at Hawick\u0026rsquos Heritage Hub.\nTwo years later, at the request of Live Borders, Selkirk playwright and actor John Nichol used material from the diaries as the basis for his one-man, one-act play, Dr John Stewart Muir: The Beloved Doctor.\nTaking the title role himself, John\u0026rsquos play received a rapturous reception at its premiere in the town\u0026rsquos County Hotel in February, 2017.\nOne scene features Dr Muir recounting an ambitious cycle ride he took to Moffat in 1916, returning via Boreland, Eskdalemuir and Ettrickbridge.\nIt is this ride that retired local GP John Wilson retraced last Wednesday, following the exact route described by Dr Muir.\n\u0026ldquoI always thought it would be amazing to recreate that ride, John told the Border  this week, \u0026ldquoso I\u0026rsquom just so happy that John Wilson was able to do it.\nJust as Dr Muir had done before him, John stopped off at Moffat\u0026rsquos Buccleuch Arms Hotel, where he was welcomed by director Polly Smith, while on the return journey he stopped at the Cross Keys in Ettrickbridge, where he was given a glass of water by owner Trevor Logan.\nDr Wilson\u0026rsquos encounters throughout the day were filmed by retired Selkirk journalist John Smail, who is making a documentary entitled A Souter\u0026rsquos Year, covering all aspects of life in Selkirk and the Valleys during 2018.\nAt the end of Wednesday\u0026rsquos ride Dr Wilson, himself an extremely proficient road cyclist, said he\u0026rsquod thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe landscape is spectacular and it makes you appreciate the history and cultural importance of this area.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure Dr Muir would

nurseries for delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken significant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved quickly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wallace-or-scott-selkirk-to-decide-on-new-signs","story":"PLANS are being drawn up for new tourism signage at Selkirk\u0026rsquos four main entrances \u0026ndash

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnificently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other significant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sheriff Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22 - on Saturday.\nShe was released on bail which had the special conditions of not driving and giving up her car keys.\nMcKain was already waiting trial on a charge of driving while more than four times the legal limit.\nThe offence is alleged to have been committed in the Asda Car Park in Galashiels on July 19.\nAn intermediate hearing has been fixed for October 22.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"primal-scream-to-headline-va-dundee-celebration-concert","story":"Scottish rock band Primal Scream is headlining a festival later to celebrate the opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee to the public.\nThe group will perform in front of thousands of fans at the 3D Festival in the city\u0026rsquos Slessor Gardens on Friday night.\nThe band will be joined on the bill by singer-songwriters Lewis Capaldi and Tallia Storm and Dundee\u0026rsquos own Be Charlotte just hours ahead of the museum\u0026rsquos official opening on Saturday.\nArchitect Kengo Kuma outside the finished exterior of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee \nBosses have also promised \u0026ldquospectacular new dance, design and lighting collaborations during the show, putting the audience and the museum at the heart of the event.\nPrimal Scream lead singer Bobby Gillespie recently said the band was looking forward to performing at the sold-out event.\nThose without a ticket can watch the festival on BBC2 Scotland from 9pm.\nThe two-day festival will continue on the Saturday with a day dedicated to celebrating creative talent from the Dundee area.

the hall, with a iety of home-made soups available from the kitchen.Outside, Wild West games were played as hardy visitors tested their strength on a bucking bronco fair ride and younger guests had their faces painted.Arran woodcarver, Henry Murdo, brought some of his masterpieces as well as a work-in-progress, a rabbit on which people could try their hand at carving.Mark MacSporran involved people of all ages in Samba drumming, using a iety of instruments to create a carnival rhythm.At night, local performers, including Gaia Silvan who sold her art through the day and Terry Russell who demonstrated his woodworking skills, joined other local musicians on stage.The headline act, Berkshire-based ska/reggae five-piece Dub The Earth, brought people to their feet straight away.Even after the official event ended, revellers gathered round a campfire with guitars, strumming the night away until 4am.Organisers Lori Silvan and Garreth Roberts thanked everyone for supporting the event,

Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S. Colville and Mr R. W. Greenlees in 1927.Mrs Mary MacFadyen, was the next winner to gain the christian name honour in 1928 and she did not have take three wins.The first and possibly only gentleman to see his christian name used, was the prolific 1950\u0026#8217s winner, Rev.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-to-make-east-lothian-venues-give-two-weeks-notice-of-18th-and-21st-birthday-parties","story":"  The new policy would be introduced for licensed premises and be made a condition for any future applications.

Officials said the changes involved positioning of new properties and parking but did not alter the number of homes planned for the land.  The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.  Following the meeting, Craig Ormond, director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, said: \u0026ldquoLethington Gardens already features Design Collection properties, so we wanted to ensure that these neighbouring houses have a similar look and feel in design terms. We are delighted that the council have agreed with us.  Lethington Gardens is part of a wider masterplan by a number of housing developers in the area.  The plans include a new primary school at the heart of the development \u0026ndash to be home to nearly 500 pupils \u0026ndash sport pitches and changing facilities, as well as a new park running east/west alongside the Letham Burn."},{"url":null,"title":"rugby-club-needs-cctv-after-licence-change","story":"  North Berwick RFC  applied to East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board for the licence, which allows it to welcome non-members to events. But it was granted with several conditions, including that the club must tell police about any 18th or 21st birthday parties being held in the Recreation Park clubhouse at least two weeks in advance.  They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not just a rugby club any longer \u0026ndash it has several different aspects to it as a community hub.  \u0026ldquoI do not see a problem in relation to the licence.  Iain Dove, NBRFC president, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased with the news that the licensing board have approved our application for a full licence, along with an identified area to the front of the club that can be used for drinks in good weather.  \u0026ldquoThis will be a fenced area, secure for children, and we hope it will prove to be popular with families. We hope to continue to grow the use of our facilities by the North Berwick community.  At the meeting, Mr Fruzynski criticised the club for not sending anyone to attend the hearing, at Haddington Town House last Thursday.  Highlighting that they were not the only applicants to fail to attend the hearing that day, he said: \u0026ldquoIt is disappointing so many applicants have not turned up to answer questions of the board because they are all advised that someone should be available to attend.

Councillor Jane Henderson, a North Berwick Coastal ward member who sits on the licensing board, pointed out that the club\u0026rsquos failure to represent itself could prove financially costly as they were not able to challenge conditions attached to the licence.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s life that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her life and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

Perth Sheriff Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sheriff Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my wife woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My wife was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light. After a second or two I came too with my wife screaming.  \"I had a lump on the side of my head which the policeman described as the size of a small egg. I don\u0027t think I could believe it.\"  Mr Wall said he told McIntosh he was calling the police and that prompted him to usher the fans back into the bus and drive off.  McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.  He was acquitted on a second charge of driving dangerously by overtaking when it was unsafe to so and colliding with the rear of Mr Wall\u0027s car.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6967954.jpg?type=article-full","title":"health-secretary-calls-a-halt-to-use-of-mesh-implants-in-scotland","story":"  Health Secretary Jeane Freeman made the announcement following the death of Eileen Baxter, 75, in August.  Multiple organ failure was said to have led to Mrs Baxter\u0026rsquos death, with sacrocolopexy mesh repair \u0026ndash an implant to fix a pelvic organ prolapse \u0026ndash noted as an underlying cause.  Her son Mark, 52, has called for the products to be completely banned.    Ms Freeman said\u0026nbspNHS boards had been told to halt the use of mesh in cases of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.This will continue until a new \"restricted use protocol\" is drawn up.  Other mesh procedures, such as transabdominal mesh, will be kept under active review and will also be subject to high vigilance procedures.She also praised the bravery of women who have come forward to share their problems following vaginal mesh surgery.  Healthcare Improvement Scotland has established a group to oversee any continued use of the treatment.  And Ms Freeman said the chief medical officer has continued to keep the issueunder review and is listening to the women who have been affected of this.  She said: \u0026ldquoI have today asked the Chief Medical Officer to instruct Health Boards to immediately halt the use of transvaginal mesh altogether in cases of both pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, pending the implementation of a new restricted use protocol that will ensure procedures are carried out only in the most exceptional circumstances and subject to a robust process of approval and fully informed consent.  \u0026ldquoThe instruction to halt is, I believe, a proportionate measure whilst a rigorous, high vigilance restricted use ptotocol for any future practice is developed and put in place.  \u0026ldquoThe lifting of this halt in use can only be considered once there is confidence that there is sufficient evidence that the protocol can only be triggered in only the most limited of circumstances \u0026ndash informed by any new evidence and the forthcoming NICE guidance which is expected in the spring of next year on the management of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.  Holyrood\u0026rsquo\u0026nbsppublic petitions committee had\u0026nbspcalled for the use of mesh implants to stop, citing \u0026ldquoserious concerns over an independent review into their use.  That review concluded the procedure \u0026ndash used in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse  and stress urinary incontinence  \u0026ndash must not be offered \u0026ldquoroutinely to women with pelvic organ prolapse.  The review was announced by the Scottish Government in 2014, with health boards requested to stop the procedure until its conclusion.  It remains under suspension in NHS Scotland except in exceptional circumstances.  The review\u0026rsquos final report was branded a \u0026ldquowhitewash by some women who have suffered painful and debilitating complications from mesh, including campaigners Elaine Holmes and Olive McIlroy.  Professor Alison Britton has been commissioned to conduct a review of the review, which is due to report later this year.      6 years of campaigning with the brilliant Elaine Holmes and @MBLacey of the Scottish mesh survivors and we have got the Scottish Govt to see sense and ban mesh implants - this could have been done 6 years ago. pic.twitter/aOuiVpoaS7  Mrs\u0026nbspBaxter\u0026nbspfrom Loanhead, died in hospital in Edinburgh last month.\u0026nbsp  She underwent mesh surgery five years ago. Her death certificate lists this as an antecedent cause of death that caused chronic pelvic inflammation and possible sepsis, leading to anterior rectal perforation and finally the multiple organ failure that ultimately resulted in her death.  And Labour MSP Neil Findlay said that he understood\u0026nbspit was the first time mesh had been specifically cited as an underlying cause of death in Scotland.  Hundreds of women in Scotland have suffered painful and debilitating complications from being given mesh implants, including infections, bleeding and even paralysis.  The use of mesh implants in NHS Scotland was suspended four years ago in all but exceptional circumstances.  But the following year it was found several health boards were still carrying out the operations.

This means that Nicola Sturgeon will not be in a position at next month\u0026rsquos SNP conference to give a clear view on Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional future because the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will still be unknown.  This is likely to disappoint many Nationalists, including those who this weekend will gather in Glasgow for a Hope over Fear Yes rally.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos future agenda, published last week, stated: \u0026ldquoAt the end of the period of negotiation with the EU, and when the terms of Brexit are clearer, we will set out our judgement on the best way forward for Scotland at that time, including our view on the precise timescale for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future.  It is widely thought that any deal with Brussels will now not be sealed at the October 18/19 European Council but could come at a special summit pencilled in for November 13.  This will be followed by ratification by parliaments across the EU as well as the so-called \"meaningful vote\" at Westminster on the final deal, possibly before Christmas.  However, Mr Blackford was clear that, as the informed debate on the economics of independence continued following the publication of the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report, no decision on when or whether to call for a second independence vote could be made until after the details of a deal were fully known.  He told reporters at a Westminster briefing: \u0026ldquoThe judgement we have made is we can reflect on what the options are for Scotland once we know the Brexit outcome.

Detectives believe it is likely the two Salisbury suspects, thought to be aged around 40, travelled under aliases and that Petrov and Boshirov are not their real names.  Officers formally linked the attack on the Skripals to events in nearby Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, were exposed to the same nerve agent.  Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July, just over a week after the pair fell ill.

The Argyll and Bute MSP said the technical notices laid bare the \u0026ldquocrippling costs and needless red tape a no-deal scenario would bring.  He added: \"A no-deal Brexit should be unthinkable, which is why it should be ruled out, if necessary by extending the Article 50 process.\"  David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, who also attended the Joint Ministerial Committee, said Mr Russell\u0026rsquos warning of a self-fulfilling prophecy about a no-deal was an \u0026ldquointeresting insight into his own psyche.  He explained: \u0026ldquoIt probably gives us an understanding as to why there is so much talk about independence by the SNP and the Scottish Government if they believe just the volume of activity creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is most definitely not the case.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos just behaving in a responsible way as the timescale moves ever closer to the point at which we will leave the EU. We had hoped we would have reached a conclusion to the process at the October Council, it looks as if that will go on until November, which would be another month closer to March 29.  \u0026ldquoThese are just responsible actions, declared Mr Mundell, stressing: \u0026ldquoThey are not the level of action compared to the effort we are putting in to get the deal.  The raft of technical notices was published after the Scottish Secretary joined his senior colleagues for a three-hour no-deal Cabinet, chaired by Theresa May, which ran through the preparations for a no-deal.  But the CBI warned the notices showed firms would be \u0026ldquohit with a sledgehammer if there were a no-deal and underlined the extent of disruption consumers could expect if \"ideology wins over evidence\".  \"Then, attention can turn to the vital task of finalising our future economic relationship with the EU,\" she added.  Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that key questions remained unanswered.  Elsewhere, Moody\u0026rsquos credit ratings agency in a report forecast that Britain would fall into recession, the pound would collapse and shop prices would rocket in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  \"We still think the UK and the EU will eventually reach an agreement to preserve many - but not all - of their current trading arrangements, particularly around trade in goods,\" said Colin Ellis, Moody\u0027s chief credit officer and co-author of the report.  \"However, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without any agreement has risen materially,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-technical-notices-main-points","story":"  The declaration came after Whitehall released another tranche of 28 technical notices on what might happen if Britain crashed out of the EU without an agreement.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most diverse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural significance and interest. There is so much to do and see in rural parts and right across Aberdeenshire and we must do all we can to maximise the opportunities for tourism and economic growth by attracting new visitors to the North-east.”Chris Foy, VisitAberdeenshire Chief Executive, added: “The event reflected the importance of rural tourism for the North-east which is a significant priority set within the destination strategy for the next five years.“It is encouraging to see the strong desire from local industry to work alongside VisitScotland and VisitAberdeenshire to strengthen the appeal of the destination to visitors, and the quality of the experience.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire man s life saving call on honeymoon","story":"        Nick and Philippa Allan got married last August and just a week later received a call that changed their lives.

The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"temporary closure for post office","story":"        Kemnay Post Office will close temporarily from the start of next month.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an individual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be diverted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwife whom you interviewed.Friday 14 Sep 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Friday 14 Sep 2018 3:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Friday 14 Sep 2018 3:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrifying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusFriday 14 Sep 2018 3:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 13, 2018 at 3:00 pmFriends of Happy Valley — the charity group which cares for the much-loved and magical woodland garden in Stenness — is in the running for a prestigious national award.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He is now communicating via email with both his work coach at JobCentre Plus, and his Fair Start Scotland Adviser. Within the 12 weeks of attending Fair Start Scotland, not only can Alan now use Microsoft Outlook, but he has completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and has been applying online for employment.In all the group workshops that Alan attends, he socialises very well with the other participants and is very cheerful. He thinks the service is going very well, and is enjoying it. Alan is very happy with the progress he has made, and has noticed the improvement in his confidence.Alan seems to be talking so much more, which may have been a barrier stopping him from getting into work. He was pleased to inform his Fair Start Scotland adviser that he got a job working 15 hours a week.Alan said: “I’ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills at Lochaber Hope. My confidence is improving a lot and so are my computer skills. I have been job searching online and sending emails — I couldn’t do this before.

That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Friday 14 Sep 2018 3:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789748.1536847444!/image/image.jpg","title":"why the snp is launching day of action on scottish independence","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The SNP made two newsworthy announcements yesterday \u0026#8211 the first declaring that a date for Indyref2 wouldn\u0026#8217t be announced at conference \u0026#8211 and the second that they plan a \u0026#8216day of action\u0026#8217 on the issue at the end of this month.                 Ambitious plans to contact 50,000 voters in a single Saturday on September 29 were reported in The Scotsman earlier today.            Depute Leader Keith Brown, who is no longer in the Scottish cabinet, appears to have taken on the mantle of increasing support for independence as his personal mission.             He said that the day of action is a way for the SNP to talk to the public across the country as Britain’s departure from the EU looms. Brexit is being used by pro-independence politicians to highlight their belief that Scotland is better off outwith the UK. But why now? And why this particular campaigning tactic? We look at the possible reasons for the party’s ‘day of action’. Campaigning inspirationIn terms of campaigning methods, the approach taken by Keith Brown, who as a three-term MSP and former Royal Marine knows a thing or two about strategy, is not new.             Elections and referendums have involved door-to-door campaigning ever since universal suffrage, and the SNP’s targeting system for potential supporters has long been the envy of rival political parties. READ MORE: Day of action planned on IndependenceOne of the successes of the Yes campaign at the 2014 referendum, despite its ultimate failure, was ensuring that activists were well versed on the basic arguments to take to doorsteps, through training and the easy availability of resources.It might seem strange that the SNP is stepping up its campaigning with no date in sight for a second independence referendum , but the day of action is as much about fact finding as it is about changing minds.             If the SNP want to marshal arguments in favour of independence next time around, they need to speak to as many people as possible to find out what might change enough voters’ minds. Speaking to 50,000 of them and finding out their views is a decent start. Political motivationsIn political terms, the SNP’s motivations might seem obvious , but in fact there could be more to it than that. Days of action like this are a way for the party to motivate activists, and get them used to working together, especially ahead of the party’s conference which takes place next month.             READ MORE: Indyref2 ‘must wait’ until after Brexit voteWith the revelation from Ian Blackford yesterday that those expecting the announcement of a date for Indyref2 soon will be disappointed, the day of action serves to reassure any members agitating for more urgency that the SNP’s raison d’etre is still a priority. Outside groups are also starting to take prominence in the independence movement, as the attendance at a ‘Hope over Fear’ rally organised by Tommy Sheridan this weekend will surely prove.A day of action could remind independence supporters  that the SNP remains the biggest and best vehicle for constitutional change, no matter how many rallies are held by outside groups. ResponseSNP politicians were quick to throw their weight behind the day of action, with politicians and party officials sharing The Scotsman story. National Executive Committee member and former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier tweeted: “On @theSNP day of action on September 29th we will speak with 50,000 voters across Scotland. #ActiveSNP”Opposition representatives were, as expected, rather less charitable, and again urged Nicola Sturgeon’s party to focus on issues at Holyrood. Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Lib Dems suggested that voters across the country would close their curtains if they saw an SNP canvasser at their door. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said that the SNP ‘might need a bit more than 50k, just to make up the ground they’ve lost’. Whatever the response, it is clear the SNP is stepping up their independence campaign just as the impact of Brexit starts to be felt.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nFriday 14 Sep 2018 3:41 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit.

This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

Northern Ireland and, indeed, across the world as a fundraising campaign was launched to help fund his treatment as part of a clinical trial in Mexico. \n\nFor a time it appeared the treatment was bearing fruit, unfortunately over the following months his condition worsened until just a few weeks ago the family warned ‘his journey was near over’. \n\nHis battle began in January 2017 when the youngster was diagnosed with an inoperable Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma also known as ‘DIPG’ which is the second most common type of primary, high grade brain tumour in children. \n\nWhile the outlook was grim his family refused to give up and they discovered a pioneering treatment in Mexico. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn September last year they travelled from their home in Waringstown near Lurgan to Mexico in a bid to save his life. \n\nThe Cure4Cam fundraising page was set up with in excess of £100,000 raised to pay for his treatment thanks to incredible support coming from Northern Ireland and beyond.\n\nRead more by \nclicking here\n.\n\n                            \n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Lifeguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital life skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lifesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n if  .each ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data         if  \u0027                 .                 .children.hide               \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n if  .each ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data            if  \u0027                        .                        .                        .children.hide                        \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n if  .each ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data            if  \u0027                        .                        .                        .children.hide                        \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnificent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before returning to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her life tremendously. Early in life she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identified a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even if they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in life and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacrificed for long term benefit, even if it is difficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her life to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “if you enjoy your job you never work a day in your life”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certificates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his life to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional life. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘life and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live. This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

However, on Botanic Avenue, which is especially popular with students, business owners begin to feel the pinch as the University term ends in December.\nRichard Walker, owner of The Other Place on Botanic’s thoroughfare, said that extending the Christmas lights would not only improve trade, but also the festive atmosphere in South Belfast.\n“Botanic Avenue is usually a very vibrant and busy area, but what we have discovered over the last couple of years is that when the Christmas lights are put up and the Christmas market comes that a lot of our customers want to go down into the city centre,” he said.\n“They want to be part of the buzz and the festivities. On Botanic Avenue we notice a lull in trade around that time.\n“We are very busy with the students returning around September up until November time. As soon as it gets close to Christmas time there is a massive downturn in trade.\n“People are going into the city centre because they want to be part of the fun. The economy is very poor at the minute and a lot of restaurants are really struggling so we rely on Christmas to help our performance throughout the year, because come January when everybody has spent their money eating out is the last thing they want to do. It puts us under a lot of pressure.”\nHe continued: “Festivals and events like the Christmas market are great for the local economy, but in Botanic Avenue and the Ormeau where we aren’t part of the city festive programme we see a drop in footfall.\n“With the tourist boom that we’ve had over the summer, we’ve seen that a lot of tourists are getting off the train at Botanic train station, and with the opening of the Grand Central Hotel, they are walking up Botanic Avenue, going to the Ulster Museum and Botanic Park. I would like that to be part of the route map for Christmas, so that we can keep that going.\n“I have spoken to a lot of local traders here and they are all very much of the same mindset. We want Botanic and Ormeau to be part of the Christmas spirit –It’s good craic. My staff would certainly like to be coming to work seeing the Christmas lights and getting into the spirit. I think it’s a good idea for local traders and the local residents too.”\nBotanic Councillor Declan Boyle said that bringing the festivities to the area is “great idea”.\n“The Christmas market is  good but I think we need to spread people out to other parts of the city too,” said.\n“The business owners pay rates and they should be given a bit of help and assistance. In Botanic Avenue their market, by and large, is university students and in the middle of December when they go it’s very quiet, so it would do no harm to help out those businesses there.\n“For the rest of the year it’s a thriving place, it has a great bohemian mix, so I think the area should be assisted in the Christmas months. It’s only a small stretch of road, and it wouldn’t have a terrible expense attached to it, so I would be very much in favour of it.”\n________________________________________\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"celebrating irish language","story":"\n\nNOMINATIONS\n are still open for The Outstanding Contribution to the Irish Language Award in this year’s Aisling Awards.\n\nThis award celebrates the vibrancy and uniqueness which the Irish language brings to the city of Belfast, the award will honour an organisation or person who works tirelessly to pioneer the language.

Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautiful, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these different organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the difference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day if it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identified all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them if they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramifications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however, if we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or if Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specifically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rifles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys brandywell stadium to be renamed in honour of tragic captain ryan mcbride","story":"\n Hi

Higgins. \n\nSinn Fein councillor Sandra Duffy said it was a fitting tribute to the former captain.\n\n\"Ryan\u0027s life, on and off the field, has left a great legacy in our city and the club and its players will continue to draw inspiration from him for many years to come,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerry City’s Brandywell Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is fitting that Ryan\u0027s legacy should live on through the stadium and the club he loved.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes, if a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts co antrim road closed due to collision","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There has been confusion as to what power civil servants have.\n\nEarlier this year a judge ruled the Department of Infrastructure had no power to approve a multi-million pound incinerator project as the decision should be taken by a minister. \n\nSecretary of State Karen Bradley has said she will bring forward legislation in Westminster to clarify the extent of powers those in the civil service have in a bid to allow government to continue to function without political leadership. \n\nMr Beggs found 13 strategies required ministerial imput. They include an evaluation of the Bamford review into mental health services, policy on GP services, agreement on minimum pricing of alcohol and a suicide prevention strategy. \n\nThere were six pieces of legislation awaiting Assembly approval. They included laws on supporting breastfeeding in public, e-cigarettes restrictions and a response to a ban on people smoking in cars with children. \n\nMr Beggs stressed those issues were just those that had been though the necessary planning and development. He said in the 600 days since the Executive\u0027s collapse the crisis in the health service had \"deepened to the extent patients are coming to harm, thousands of positions across the health service are vacant and the gap between demand and capacity of the local system has widened even further\". \n\nHe added: \"Even the 2018/19 pay award for our doctors and nurses remains up in the air, despite being already finalised in England, Scotland and Wales. We are now half way through the financial year without a local decision. \n\n“Another key decision outstanding are what actions are required to live within Budget for 2019/20. The last time the Health Department used language like that was in summer 2017 when each of Northern Ireland’s five health trusts announced sweeping cuts in a desperate attempt to make £70m of emergency savings.\n\n\"The later changes are left in the health service the higher the impact it has on frontline patient services.\n\n“Most of the issues in the list however are non-contentious and have cross-party support yet they can’t be advanced simply because there is no mechanism in place in the absence of an Executive.\n\n“The Secretary of State has allowed the stalemate to run on for far too long. Most, if not all, of these delays could have been avoided had she acted much quicker to put some form of decision making in place before now.\n\n“Without a Minister in place to take and implement health decisions, our waiting lists will continue to get even longer and the community will suffer. \n\n\"The Prime Minister has a responsibility to everyone in the UK.  A meeting of the Assembly should be called and if local politicians fail to appoint a functioning Executive, the Prime Minster needs to step in and appoint a direct rule Health Minister to end the drift in healthcare.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin city council votes to save last magdalene laundry in state ownership","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

in July next year after offering two special editions for sale.\n\nThe compact Beetle was introduced in Germany in 1938 during the Nazi era and came to the US 11 years later, where it became a symbol of utilitarian transportation often used by hippies. \n\nThe famous car sold for about 30 years before US sales stopped in 1979. \n\nThe last of the original bugs was produced in Puebla, Mexico, in 2003.\n\n\nTimeless beauty, classic design. \n#tbt\n \n#classic\n \n#bridge\n \n#vwbeetle\n \n#volkswagen\n \npic.twitter/ffe02F5LCZ\n\n— Volkswagen  \nSeptember 13, 2018\n\n\n\n\nVolkswagen revived it in the US in 1998 as a more modern “New Beetle”, but it attracted mainly female buyers. \n\nThe company revamped it for the 2012 model year in an effort to make it appeal to men, giving it a flatter roof, less bulbous shape, a bigger trunk and a navigation system. \n\nUS sales rose five-fold to nearly 29,000 in the first year, but tailed off after that. \n\nLast year VW sold only 8,627, according to Autodata Corp.\n\nThe special editions, which come in coupe and convertible body styles, get unique beige and blue colours in addition to the normal hues. \n\nThey also get standard extra chrome, new wheels and three-colour ambient lighting inside.\n\nVolkswagen said it has no immediate plans to revive the Beetle again, but the company would not rule it out.\n\n“I would say ‘never say never’,” Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said in a statement.\n\nThe company plans to roll out an electric version of the old Bus in 2022 called the ID Buzz.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry mep says no border crossings without new driving permit plan shows disastrous impact brexit","story":"\nSinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson has said the Tory admission that drivers in the north will need an international driving permit to drive across the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit shows the disastrous impact Brexit will have on the north and how little the British government cares. \n\nMartina Anderson said: \n\n\"Following the publication of the latest tranche of scenarios for a no-deal Brexit, it has emerged that drivers in the north will no longer be able to drive across the border without an International Driving Permit. \n\n\"This shows the ludicrousness of the Tory Brexit agenda and also how little knowledge, appreciation or care they have for people in areas like Derry, which is essentially a cross-border city, and the many thousands across the north who drive across the border every day to work or study. \n\n\n\n

border delays if permits are to be checked. \n\n\"Such a development would be disastrous for businesses, particularly small businesses in border areas, and could have huge implications for the tourism and service industries north and south. \n\n\"The papers also show that important EU funding streams for agriculture, infrastructure and energy will come to an end, as well as access to EU study programmes, with some ending as soon as Britain leaves the EU in march 2019 if there is no deal. \n\n\"In all, there is nothing to allay anyone\u0027s fears over Brexit in these papers. Instead it adds to the uncertainty with the only thing we do know for sure is that Tory Brexiteers do not care about the north and never did.\"\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"local schools invited mark 50th anniversary civil rights campaign began","story":"\nLocal schools will be part of a special event next month commemorating 50 years since the Civil Rights movement first began its official campaign of action on the streets of Derry with the Duke Street March.\n\nOn October 5th young people will gather in the Guildhall to find out more about one of the most significant days in local history, with a full programme of activities planned to mark the anniversary.\n\nThe march, which was organised by Derry Housing Action Committee in association with NICRA, changed the face of the Civil Rights Movement across Northern Ireland. The media captured the events of the day relaying it to a mass audience via TV and radio, and subsequently it became known as the day the Troubles began.\n\nThe event is being held as part of the Speeches Strikes and Struggles series which has been running throughout the year, led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and supported by the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund. The programme aims to open archive materials up to new audiences and offer a iety of perspectives on what was an immensely significant era.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said it would provide a unique opportunity to hear first-hand accounts from some of the people who led the civil rights campaign. \n\n“The Duke Street March changed the course of local history by initiating a movement against the civil oppression which had affected the lives of so many people across N. Ireland. People took to the streets to demonstrate that they were not prepared to accept the ongoing violation of their civil rights which had become the accepted way of life here.\n\n“50 years on we live in a very different society thanks to the actions of those who were prepared to stand up against oppression.

I can think of no better location for a community event, and I would like to invite families to come along and enjoy some great activities and support a fantastic cause.\n\n“Foyle Search and Rescue are providing an invaluable service for the local community and this is an opportunity for us to acknowledge that work with a huge showing of support.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to meeting and greeting you all so please stop for a picture and say hello.”\n\nActivities on the day will be based in and around the Café Area and children’s playpark with a whole host of things to enjoy, with Bouncy Castles, a Rodeo Bull and a special carousel.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nChildren can also enjoy face painting and balloon modelling as well as complimentary hot chocolate.\n\nIn keeping with Council’s aims to create a zero waste Council area, on the day Conservation Volunteers will also be bringing along the Green Bus and organising a number of fun activities to raise awareness about protecting and enhancing the environment.

That said, I do think that we would be more than capable of managing a crowd of 10,000 next year if things went really well.”\n\nRoss concluded: “It’s a crazy amount of work that goes into just one weekend in August but we love every minute of it and continue to be incredibly grateful and humbled by all the love and support we receive from everyone.”\n\nA limited number of Early Bird tickets are available for Stendhal 2019 now on StendhalFestival.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"western trust supporting childminders week 2018 hosting","story":"\nThe Western Health and Social Care Trust  Health Improvement Department’s Community Food and Nutrition Team is supporting Childminder’s Week from 24 to 28 September by holding a number of nutrition workshops during September 2018.\n\nZoe Fletcher, Western Trust Health Improvement Dietitian – Project Lead Community Food and Nutrition Team explains the benefits for childminders to attend one of the nutrition workshops: “Good nutrition is essential during childhood as it is a time of rapid growth and development.

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily. It will be open at weekends.\n\nLocal councillor Dermot Curran has expressed concern that motorists and visitors to the area face more disruption and believes the resurfacing work should have been completed during the recent road closures.\n\nHe plans to contact the Department for Infrastructure to ensure the resurfacing work can be completed as soon as possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main road linking Downpatrick and Ardglass carries a high volume of traffic, with a lot of this associated with the village\u0026rsquos fishing industry. These road closures are disruptive and I am disappointed the drainage upgrade and resurfacing work was not completed at the same time, continued Cllr Curran.\n\n\u0026ldquoI am fully supportive of the much-needed investment along this particular route, but feel the timing of the work to minimise road closures and disruption could have been handled better.\n\nAlso this week, Cllr Curran has revealed a similar situation has arisen on the Strangford side of Ardglass where a road was closed recently as part of planned improvements.\n\nA section of the road linking the village with Chapeltown was closed in mid-July to upgrade drainage systems and is now closed again. Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment. I just sometimes think that the execution of the schemes could be better to minimise disruption.\n\n\u0026ldquoFor example, the closure of the Chapeltown Road which links Ardglass with Strangford will be in operation when children return to school for the new term.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Championships getting serious  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO remain on target for a magical seven-in-a-row as the race for the Down Senior Football Championship crown starts to intensify.\n\nPaul McIver\u0026rsquos record-breakers saw off Downpatrjck on a score of 2-14 to 0-10 in Newcastle on Saturday evening and now await the draw to see who they will meet in the semi-finals.\n\nThe draw was to have been made on Monday night following the clash between Loughinisland and Warrenpoint, but as that finished level at 0-9 apiece, the draw will now take place in St Malachy\u0026rsquos Park, Castlewellan, after Saturday\u0026rsquos replay.\n\nDownpatrick were expected to push Kilcoo all the way in their quarter-final, but the threat never materialised.\n\nKilcoo had just too know how for Downpatrick and second half goals from Ceilum Doherty and a returning Ryan Johnston put the issue out of the RGU\u0026rsquos reach.\n\nJoining Kilcoo in the semi-finals are Mayobridge and Burren with the fourth place waiting on the outcome of the Loughinisland v Warrenpoint replay.\n\nMayobridge were taken to the wire by Clonduff in their quarter-final tie and only emerged 2-16 to 2-15 winners after a mighty Clonduff fightback just fell short.\n\nBurren had their hands full against Castlewellan on Sunday night, but they were able to spring Donal O\u0026rsquoHare from the bench and his contribution of three points at a crucial stage of the game proved decisive \u0026mdash Burren scraping home 0-10 to 0-7.\n\nCoincidentally, despite the fact that the current system used for the SFC and IFC has been heavily criticised, the top four teams in Division 1 of the ACFL \u0026mdash should Warrenpoint go through \u0026mdash are all in the last four.\n\nIt is a similar case in the IFC with Bredagh, Liatroim and Darragh Cross \u0026mdash who were all expected to reach this stage of the competition \u0026mdash joining Division 3 leaders Saul in the semi-finals.\n\nThe IFC draw was made in Monday night and pits Darragh Cross against East Down rivals Liatroim with Saul clashing with Bredagh in another all East Down derby.\n\nDarragh were extremely impressive in their 2-8 to 0-6 demolition of Drumgath in Kilcoo on Monday night, while Liatroim enjoyed a 2-17 to 0-12 win over Tullylish.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identify with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete length of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautiful peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting returns to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

There was also a four-to-five knot south westerly wind blowing and while there was a cloudy sky overhead, visibility was reported as good.\n\nDue to the position of the vessel on dangerous rocks and fishing gear in the area, the Newcastle RNLI crew on the larger all-weather lifeboat were unable to get close enough to lift the man off the stricken yacht.\n\nHowever, the volunteer RNLI crew from Portaferry on the smaller inshore lifeboat were able to manoeuvre their vessel through the rocks and rough seas to lift the man from the rocks into the lifeboat.\n\nOnce on board, the volunteer crew took the man to Ardglass marina where he was safely handed over to the Newcastle coast guard team.

Both rings are decorated.\n\nThe broken ring\u0026rsquos surface is divided into a number of panels, some with a cross-style motif. The decoration, though not as accomplished as on other examples, does compare with similar patterns which experts suggest characterise a series of silver rings of 12th-century date from both Ireland and Britain.\n\nThe intact rings decoration includes a flower pattern and traces of lettering which may read a version of \u0026lsquoIESU REX EXAUDI NOS\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoJesus, king, hear us\u0026rsquo, but this is not certain.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe nature of the lettering, which is termed Lombardic, suggests the 13th or 14th century while the style of the ring overall is consistent with this date. As the two rings from Bright differ little from each other in date, it is assumed they were lost or deposited together at the same time.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are of interest in illustrating the range of finger rings being worn in east Ulster in the late middle ages and might have been made locally or imported.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe ruins of Bright Castle, believed to have been built between the 15th and 16th century, are close by and may have been built on an earlier settlement.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
